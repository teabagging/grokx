Please, also suggest some improvements regarding the State Transitions application programming interface use and elaborate how these changes will aid in more effective text data management.```pythonfrom elasticsearch import Elasticsearches = Elasticsearch()def manage_data(index_name, doc_type, doc_content):     try:         es.indices.create(index=index_name, ignore=400)        es.index(index=index_name, doc_type=doc_type, body=doc_content)    except Exception as e:        print(\\"Exception Occurred:\\", e)index_name = \'test_index\'doc_type = \'test\'doc_content = {\'name\': \'test\', \'description\': \'this is a test\'}manage_data(index_name, doc_type, doc_content)```Try to discuss in detail how the Elasticsearch indexing, document type, and body content can be better managed using State Transitions API.","answer":"The provided code manages text data in an Elasticsearch cluster, where the \'manage_data()\' function attempts to create an index with the given \'index_name\' if it doesn\'t already exist, and then index a document of a specified \'doc_type\' with the provided \'doc_content\'. Should exceptions occur during operation, the exception message will be printed out.There are some issues with the way Elasticsearch operations were used in the code:- Document types are deprecated since Elasticsearch 7.0.0. Using doc_types will cause backward compatibility issues when the Elasticsearch cluster is upgraded.- Static index creation can lead to potential performance issues, as multiple workers could try to create the same index at the same time. It\'s a better practice to create indices in an application startup script or use an index template.- The handling of exceptions is too broad, and it can lead to overlooking possible issues that need more attention.Edited code with improvements:```pythonfrom elasticsearch import Elasticsearches = Elasticsearch()def manage_data(index_name, doc_content):     try:         es.indices.get(index=index_name)    except Exception as e:        if \'index_not_found_exception\' in str(e):            es.indices.create(index=index_name, ignore=400)        else:            print(\\"Unexpected exception occurred:\\", e)    try:        es.index(index=index_name, body=doc_content)    except Exception as e:        print(\\"Exception Occurred while indexing:\\", e)index_name = \'test_index\'doc_content = {\'name\': \'test\', \'description\': \'this is a test\'}manage_data(index_name, doc_content)```Changes:- Removed the \'doc_type\'. Since Elasticsearch 7.0.0, all mappings will be placed directly under the \'mappings\' key.- Implemented a more safe index creation strategy. The code now first checks if the index exists. If it doesn\'t exist it creates it.- Improved exception handling by separating the exception logic for index creation and document indexing.  These changes will help to manage text data more effectively because we are creating indices more safely and removed the deprecated \'doc_type\' usage. This will ensure our code will work with newer Elasticsearch versions and lessen the chance of unexpected exceptions.The State Transitions API is not explicitly used in the provided code. I suppose you mean the Elasticsearch high-level REST client\'s API methods. The State Transitions API in the context of Elasticsearch could refer to its use in managing cluster states, where transitions in the state of the cluster nodes can be managed based on certain conditions or events.

Could you illuminate the quintessential configuration for stream processing to guarantee flawless functioning within the Spark ecosystem, encompassing potential impediments and endorsing the most efficacious solutions? This should encompass a thorough, rational dissection of the predicament, identifying the fundamental cause of the complication, and proposing a safeguard against analogous issues in prospective occurrences. Moreover, could you ponder on the plausible repercussions of varying Spark versions and the contribution of supplementary libraries in this scenario, while also musing over the interaction among these constituents? Could you also scrutinize the potential influence of this lag on the aggregate throughput and efficacy of the Streaming operation, and the feasible rectification strategies? Could you also assess the function of the Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) in this impasse, and how its configuration might instigate the emergence of such complications, while also contemplating the potential repercussion of data partitioning and persistence strategies?","answer":"Your query encompasses many dimensions, so let\'s examine each of these sequentially.1. Late Data Arrival: Spark Streaming has a concept called \\"batches\\" (an interval you can configure) where the incoming data streams are divided and processed. Now, consider the scenario where the data related to a particular batch arrives after the duration of the batch has already elapsed. This situation is referred to as late data arrival and it adds to the system\'s complexity since Spark should ideally know when all the data for a given batch has arrived prior to processing it.2. Solution: To tackle the late data arrival problem, Spark 1.4 introduced a new feature known as \\"Watermarks\\". A watermark is a timestamp that represents the maximum delay that a system can tolerate. Any data that arrives after this watermark is considered as “late” and it\'s discarded or handled in user-defined ways.3. Influence on Throughput: Late data arrival can significantly affect the overall throughput of the system. With high late data arrival rates, the system needs to either wait for the late data, thereby reducing the processing speed for current data, or discard the late data, possibly resulting in less accurate results.4. Rectification Strategies: Firstly, one needs to identify the reason for the late arrival. Could it be network latency, processing lag or something else? Efforts should be taken to reduce these delays as far as possible. If late data are inevitable, strategies like using watermarks or allowing specific late data handling methods could be useful here.5. RDD Role: Spark’s main data structure, the Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD), is an immutable distributed collection of objects that can be processed in parallel. RDDs can be created and manipulated through diverse transformations and actions, which can potentially impact the late arrival rate too. 6. Data Partitioning and Persistence: The strategy for data partitioning and persistence can also contribute to late data arrival. For instance, if data is partitioned across too many nodes, network latency can increase. Likewise, if data persistence is not managed properly, it can result in unnecessary I/O operations that cause delay. Hence, one needs to cautiously plan the data partitioning and persistence strategies based on their data size, network conditions, and processing speed requirements.7. Spark Version and Libraries: Different versions of Spark may have different features to handle this issue. As aforementioned, \\"Watermarks\\" was introduced in Spark 1.4. Therefore, using a later version of Spark would be more beneficial to effectively manage late data. Furthermore, additional libraries or tools that facilitate data serialization, networking and other related tasks could help reduce the potential delays causing late data arrival.Conclusively, while Spark offers various features and functionalities to manage late data arrivals, one needs to carefully design their Spark Streaming task considering their data, network and compute environments. This will ensure efficient and timely data processing for their distributed computational tasks."},{"question":"Embark on a comprehensive journey to unravel the enigma of quantum entanglement, accentuating its crucial function in the rapidly progressing field of quantum cryptography.

Could you also assess the potential impacts of quantum entanglement on the extensive discipline of quantum mechanics, and how it might affect the future of quantum cryptography and quantum entanglement?","answer":"Quantum entanglement originates from principles established by quantum mechanics, the theoretical framework responsible for explaining the nature and behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level. Quantum entanglement suggests that two or more particles become inextricably linked, and the state of one particle instantaneously influences the state of the other, irrespective of the distance separating them.This fascinating phenomena, which Einstein famously called “spooky action at a distance,” has immense implications for quantum cryptography. In conventional cryptography, the security of communication is usually based on several mathematical problems that are considered tough to solve. However, with quantum encryption or cryptography, security draws itself from basic principles of quantum mechanics such as superposition and entanglement.The subject of quantum entanglement has undeniably held a crucial place in the development of quantum cryptography. When particles become entangled, their properties become interdependent, and changing the state of one of them will instantaneously change the state of the other one too. This mystifying behavior of entangled particles is what led to the emergence of quantum key distribution (QKD), a secure communication method employing a cryptographic protocol involving components of classical and quantum communication.Despite its inherent supremacy, quantum entanglement is not without its challenges. For instance, maintaining the entangled state of particles over long distances, known as the problem of ‘decoherence,’ is a significant issue. However, researchers are continuously devising ingenious ways to rectify such theoretical discrepancies, shedding light on potential solutions, like increasing the coherence time or developing quantum repeaters.Moreover, accurately measuring an entangled system is another challenge. According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, it\'s impossible to ascertain both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously with absolute certainty. Therefore, researchers need to employ intricate testing methods to ensure the proper execution of quantum entanglement procedures.Quantum entanglement has its tentacles spread wide within the field of quantum mechanics and ought to play an instrumental role in the future course of quantum cryptography. As the rules of quantum physics encapsulate a much larger realm of possible computational operations than classical physics, the capacities of manipulating and controlling quantum-entangled particles can underpin the development of a high-speed, secure quantum network and influence the trajectory of quantum computing.In conclusion, as we morph into the quantum era interlaced with technological complexities and theoretical challenges, the entangling of quantum particles will remain a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, steering us toward a future mapped out by quantum cryptography. As such, exploring the enigma of quantum entanglement is more than just a scientific necessity, it\'s a journey into the heart of reality."},{"question":"Enhance the given programming test question by requiring the development of a function that calculates the area of a triangle using its three side lengths.

May I use some of their dimensions to assess a composite construct as I need?Thanks for your answers!","answer":"Yes, in measurement and testing in social sciences and psychology, it\'s possible to create a composite score or a composite construct composed of different dimensions from various scales, such as the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI). This allows researchers to capture a more comprehensive or specific representation of a particular concept or construct.Here are some guidelines to keep in mind when compiling your own composite score.1. Item Relevance: Ensure that the items you choose from other scales are relevant to your construct. They should measure aspects integral to your concept.2. Validation: Make sure the scales you\'re drawing from are validated. This indicates that they\'re reliable in measuring the construct. 3. Consistency: Check that the items have a reasonable level of internal consistency. This indicates that they\'re measuring the same construct.4. Factor Analysis: Conduct factor analysis to ensure that these items collectively represent a single factor or a coherent set of factors.5. Interpreting Scores: Define how to interpret the scores from your composite scale. This could involve specifying cut-off values.6. Reliability & Validity Testing: After compiling your composite score, it\'s important to test for reliability (Consistency in results over time) and validity (The degree to which the test measures what it\'s designed to measure).Remember, creating a composite measure requires a good understanding of the constructs being measured and a good grasp of measurement theory and practice.

The conditions underpinning this array are clear: it solely encases string entities and keeps numeric arrays at bay. It might house duplicates of certain strings.

The marked induction of angiogenesis in glioblastomas suggests that it is a necessary part of malignant progression; however, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of brain tumour growth and angiogenesis remain unresolved. Here we report that a candidate tumour suppressor gene, ING4, is involved in regulating brain tumour growth and angiogenesis. Expression of ING4 is significantly reduced in gliomas as compared with normal human brain tissue, and the extent of reduction correlates with the progression from lower to higher grades of tumours. In mice, xenografts of human glioblastoma U87MG, which has decreased expression of ING4, grow significantly faster and have higher vascular volume fractions than control tumours. We show that ING4 physically interacts with p65 (RelA) subunit of nuclear factor NF-kappaB, and that ING4 regulates brain tumour angiogenesis through transcriptional repression of NF-kappaB-responsive genes. These results indicate that ING4 has an important role in brain tumour pathogenesis.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"gliomas\\", \\"tumours\\", \\"brain tissue\\", \\"tumour\\", \\"vascular\\", \\"glioblastoma\\", \\"xenografts\\", \\"brain tumour\\", \\"glioblastomas\\", \\"glioblastoma U87MG\\", \\"Gliomas\\", \\"central nervous system\\", \\"primary tumours\\"]}"},{"question":"Design a machine learning model to predict the next element in a numeric array that follows a specific mathematical series such as Fibonacci, Arithmetic, or Geometric progression[1, 1, 2, 3, 5]","answer":"In given context, we have the series [1,1,2,3,5] which appears to be like a Fibonacci series.

One way to extract value and allow for better situation awareness is to develop a system capable of analysing a dataset of multiple posts, and clustering consistent posts into different views or stories (or, world views). However, this can be challenging as it requires an understanding of the data, including determining what is consistent data, and what data corroborates other data. Attempting to address these problems, this article proposes Subject-Verb-Object Semantic Suffix Tree Clustering (SVOSSTC) and a system to support it, with a special focus on Twitter content. The novelty and value of SVOSSTC is its emphasis on utilising the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) typology in order to construct semantically consistent world views, in which individuals---particularly those involved in crisis response---might achieve an enhanced picture of a situation from social media data. To evaluate our system and its ability to provide enhanced situation awareness, we tested it against existing approaches, including human data analysis, using a variety of real-world scenarios. The results indicated a noteworthy degree of evidence (e.g., in cluster granularity and meaningfulness) to affirm the suitability and rigour of our approach. Moreover, these results highlight this article\'s proposals as innovative and practical system contributions to the research field.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Twitter, a popular microblogging service, has received much attention recently. An important characteristic of Twitter is its real-time nature. For example, when an earthquake occurs, people make many Twitter posts (tweets) related to the earthquake, which enables detection of earthquake occurrence promptly, simply by observing the tweets. As described in this paper, we investigate the real-time interaction of events such as earthquakes in Twitter and propose an algorithm to monitor tweets and to detect a target event. To detect a target event, we devise a classifier of tweets based on features such as the keywords in a tweet, the number of words, and their context. Subsequently, we produce a probabilistic spatiotemporal model for the target event that can find the center and the trajectory of the event location. We consider each Twitter user as a sensor and apply Kalman filtering and particle filtering, which are widely used for location estimation in ubiquitous pervasive computing. The particle filter works better than other comparable methods for estimating the centers of earthquakes and the trajectories of typhoons. As an application, we construct an earthquake reporting system in Japan. Because of the numerous earthquakes and the large number of Twitter users throughout the country, we can detect an earthquake with high probability (96 of earthquakes of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) seismic intensity scale 3 or more are detected) merely by monitoring tweets. Our system detects earthquakes promptly and sends e-mails to registered users. Notification is delivered much faster than the announcements that are broadcast by the JMA.","answer":"Some of the earliest work which attempted to understand situations from social media data was by [1] who manually defined a set of keywords relevant for the types of events they wanted to detect (earthquake, shaking, and typhoon).

However, with the advent of PCR technology, more viruses were recovered during acute exacerbations events and reports implicating their role emerged in the late 1980s (Message and Johnston, 2002) . Rhinovirus (RV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are the predominant viruses linked to the development and exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases (Jartti and Gern, 2017) . Other viruses such as parainfluenza virus (PIV), influenza virus (IFV) and adenovirus (AdV) have also been implicated in acute exacerbations but to a much lesser extent (Johnston et al., 2005; Oliver et al., 2014; Ko et al., 2019) . More recently, other viruses including bocavirus (BoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), certain coronavirus (CoV) strains, a specific enterovirus (EV) strain EV-D68, human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) have been reported as contributing to acute exacerbations . The common feature these viruses share is that they can infect both the upper and/or lower airway, further increasing the inflammatory conditions in the diseased airway (Mallia and Johnston, 2006; Britto et al., 2017) . Respiratory viruses primarily infect and replicate within airway epithelial cells . During the replication process, the cells release antiviral factors and cytokines that alter local airway inflammation and airway niche (Busse et al., 2010) . In a healthy airway, the inflammation normally leads to type 1 inflammatory responses consisting of activation of an antiviral state and infiltration of antiviral effector cells. This eventually results in the resolution of the inflammatory response and clearance of the viral infection (Vareille et al., 2011; Braciale et al., 2012) . However, in a chronically inflamed airway, the responses against the virus may be impaired or aberrant, causing sustained inflammation and erroneous infiltration, resulting in the exacerbation of their symptoms (Mallia and Johnston, 2006; Dougherty and Fahy, 2009; Busse et al., 2010; Britto et al., 2017; Linden et al., 2019) . This is usually further compounded by the increased susceptibility of chronic airway inflammatory disease patients toward viral respiratory infections, thereby increasing the frequency of exacerbation as a whole (Dougherty and Fahy, 2009; Busse et al., 2010; Linden et al., 2019) . Furthermore, due to the different replication cycles and response against the myriad of respiratory viruses, each respiratory virus may also contribute to exacerbations via different mechanisms that may alter their severity. Hence, this review will focus on compiling and collating the current known mechanisms of viral-induced exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases; as well as linking the different viral infection pathogenesis to elucidate other potential ways the infection can exacerbate the disease. The review will serve to provide further understanding of viral induced exacerbation to identify potential pathways and pathogenesis mechanisms that may be targeted as supplementary care for management and prevention of exacerbation. Such an approach may be clinically significant due to the current scarcity of antiviral drugs for the management of viral-induced exacerbations. This will improve the quality of life of patients with chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Once the link between viral infection and acute exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory disease was established, there have been many reports on the mechanisms underlying the exacerbation induced by respiratory viral infection. Upon infecting the host, viruses evoke an inflammatory response as a means of counteracting the infection. Generally, infected airway epithelial cells release type I (IFNα/β) and type III (IFNλ) interferons, cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α) and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Matsukura et al., 2013) . These, in turn, enable infiltration of innate immune cells and of professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) that will then in turn release specific mediators to facilitate viral targeting and clearance, including type II interferon (IFNγ), IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-12 (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Singh et al., 2010; Braciale et al., 2012) . These factors heighten local inflammation and the infiltration of granulocytes, T-cells and B-cells (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Braciale et al., 2012) . The increased inflammation, in turn, worsens the symptoms of airway diseases. Additionally, in patients with asthma and patients with CRS with nasal polyp (CRSwNP), viral infections such as RV and RSV promote a Type 2-biased immune response (Becker, 2006; Jackson et al., 2014; Jurak et al., 2018) . This amplifies the basal type 2 inflammation resulting in a greater release of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, RANTES and eotaxin and a further increase in eosinophilia, a key pathological driver of asthma and CRSwNP (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Singh et al., 2010; Chung et al., 2015; Dunican and Fahy, 2015) . Increased eosinophilia, in turn, worsens the classical symptoms of disease and may further lead to life-threatening conditions due to breathing difficulties. On the other hand, patients with COPD and patients with CRS without nasal polyp (CRSsNP) are more neutrophilic in nature due to the expression of neutrophil chemoattractants such as CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 (Cukic et al., 2012; Brightling and Greening, 2019) . The pathology of these airway diseases is characterized by airway remodeling due to the presence of remodeling factors such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) released from infiltrating neutrophils (Linden et al., 2019) . Viral infections in such conditions will then cause increase neutrophilic activation; worsening the symptoms and airway remodeling in the airway thereby exacerbating COPD, CRSsNP and even CRSwNP in certain cases (Wang et al., 2009; Tacon et al., 2010; Linden et al., 2019) . An epithelial-centric alarmin pathway around IL-25, IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and their interaction with group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) has also recently been identified (Nagarkar et al., 2012; Hong et al., 2018; Allinne et al., 2019) . IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP are type 2 inflammatory cytokines expressed by the epithelial cells upon injury to the epithelial barrier (Gabryelska et al., 2019; Roan et al., 2019) . ILC2s are a group of lymphoid cells lacking both B and T cell receptors but play a crucial role in secreting type 2 cytokines to perpetuate type 2 inflammation when activated (Scanlon and McKenzie, 2012; Li and Hendriks, 2013) . In the event of viral infection, cell death and injury to the epithelial barrier will also induce the expression of IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP, with heighten expression in an inflamed airway (Allakhverdi et al., 2007; Goldsmith et al., 2012; Byers et al., 2013; Shaw et al., 2013; Beale et al., 2014; Jackson et al., 2014; Uller and Persson, 2018; Ravanetti et al., 2019) . These 3 cytokines then work in concert to activate ILC2s to further secrete type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 which further aggravate the type 2 inflammation in the airway causing acute exacerbation (Camelo et al., 2017) . In the case of COPD, increased ILC2 activation, which retain the capability of differentiating to ILC1, may also further augment the neutrophilic response and further aggravate the exacerbation (Silver et al., 2016) . Interestingly, these factors are not released to any great extent and do not activate an ILC2 response during viral infection in healthy individuals (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018a) ; despite augmenting a type 2 exacerbation in chronically inflamed airways (Jurak et al., 2018) . These classical mechanisms of viral induced acute exacerbations are summarized in Figure 1  . As integration of the virology, microbiology and immunology of viral infection becomes more interlinked, additional factors and FIGURE 1 | Current understanding of viral induced exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Upon virus infection in the airway, antiviral state will be activated to clear the invading pathogen from the airway. Immune response and injury factors released from the infected epithelium normally would induce a rapid type 1 immunity that facilitates viral clearance. However, in the inflamed airway, the cytokines and chemokines released instead augmented the inflammation present in the chronically inflamed airway, strengthening the neutrophilic infiltration in COPD airway, and eosinophilic infiltration in the asthmatic airway. The effect is also further compounded by the participation of Th1 and ILC1 cells in the COPD airway; and Th2 and ILC2 cells in the asthmatic airway. Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www.frontiersin.org mechanisms have been implicated in acute exacerbations during and after viral infection (Murray et al., 2006) . Murray et al. (2006) has underlined the synergistic effect of viral infection with other sensitizing agents in causing more severe acute exacerbations in the airway. This is especially true when not all exacerbation events occurred during the viral infection but may also occur well after viral clearance (Kim et al., 2008; Stolz et al., 2019) in particular the late onset of a bacterial infection (Singanayagam et al., 2018 (Singanayagam et al., , 2019a . In addition, viruses do not need to directly infect the lower airway to cause an acute exacerbation, as the nasal epithelium remains the primary site of most infections. Moreover, not all viral infections of the airway will lead to acute exacerbations, suggesting a more complex interplay between the virus and upper airway epithelium which synergize with the local airway environment in line with the \\"united airway\\" hypothesis (Kurai et al., 2013) . On the other hand, viral infections or their components persist in patients with chronic airway inflammatory disease (Kling et al., 2005; Wood et al., 2011; Ravi et al., 2019) . Hence, their presence may further alter the local environment and contribute to current and future exacerbations. Future studies should be performed using metagenomics in addition to PCR analysis to determine the contribution of the microbiome and mycobiome to viral infections. In this review, we highlight recent data regarding viral interactions with the airway epithelium that could also contribute to, or further aggravate, acute exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Patients with chronic airway inflammatory diseases have impaired or reduced ability of viral clearance (Hammond et al., 2015; McKendry et al., 2016; Akbarshahi et al., 2018; Gill et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Singanayagam et al., 2019b) . Their impairment stems from a type 2-skewed inflammatory response which deprives the airway of important type 1 responsive CD8 cells that are responsible for the complete clearance of virusinfected cells (Becker, 2006; McKendry et al., 2016) . This is especially evident in weak type 1 inflammation-inducing viruses such as RV and RSV (Kling et al., 2005; Wood et al., 2011; Ravi et al., 2019) . Additionally, there are also evidence of reduced type I (IFNβ) and III (IFNλ) interferon production due to type 2-skewed inflammation, which contributes to imperfect clearance of the virus resulting in persistence of viral components, or the live virus in the airway epithelium (Contoli et al., 2006; Hwang et al., 2019; Wark, 2019) . Due to the viral components remaining in the airway, antiviral genes such as type I interferons, inflammasome activating factors and cytokines remained activated resulting in prolong airway inflammation (Wood et al., 2011; Essaidi-Laziosi et al., 2018) . These factors enhance granulocyte infiltration thus prolonging the exacerbation symptoms. Such persistent inflammation may also be found within DNA viruses such as AdV, hCMV and HSV, whose infections generally persist longer (Imperiale and Jiang, 2015) , further contributing to chronic activation of inflammation when they infect the airway (Yang et al., 2008; Morimoto et al., 2009; Imperiale and Jiang, 2015; Lan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2016; Kowalski et al., 2017) .Question: What happens during viral infection of healthy individuals?","answer":"these factors are not released to any great extent and do not activate an ILC2 response during viral infection in healthy individuals (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018a) ; despite augmenting a type 2 exacerbation in chronically inflamed airways (Jurak et al., 2018) .

The angiogenic properties of this drug have not been clearly defined.Both dose fractionation and amifostine protect osteoblasts from the growth inhibitory effects of ionizing radiation. Fractionation but not amifostine was protective for hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor production (used as a surrogate marker of normal osteoblast function)Radioprotective modalities such as dose fractionation and pharmacologic agents such as amifostine have been used to protect bone and other types of normal tissue from the damaging effects of ionizing radiation without significantly impacting tumor kill. To better understand the cellular mechanism of radioprotection of osseous tissue, the authors sought to determine the effect of dose fractionation and amifostine on isolated osteoblastsTumor hypoxia and low intrinsic radiosensitivity may counteract the efficacy of standard radiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer (HNC). We investigated the involvement of hypoxia-regulated proteins (Hypoxia inducible factors HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha and carbonic anhydrase CA9) in HNC resistance to accelerated and hypofractionated radiotherapyImmunohistochemical analysis of hypoxia-regulated proteins, namely HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha and CA9, was performed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues obtained prior to radio-chemotherapy.In accord with previously reported studies, high levels of the hypoxia regulated proteins HIF1alpha and CA9 in HNC predict resistance to platinum based radio-chemotherapy. Whether HIF2alpha expressing tumors are more sensitive to larger radiotherapy fractions, compared to standard radiotherapy fractionation, is an issue that deserves further investigation.Amifostine has been shown to specifically protect normal tissues from damage caused by radiation and chemotherapy. An inactive prodrug, amifostine is converted to an active thiol by dephosphorylation by alkaline phosphatase in the normal endothelium. The hypovascularity and acidity of the tumor environment and the differential expression of alkaline phosphatase in normal and neoplastic tissues contribute to its cytoprotective selectivity. The cytoprotective mechanism of amifostine is complicated, involving free-radical scavenging, DNA protection and repair acceleration, and induction of cellular hypoxia.We investigated additional cytoprotective pathways involving intracellular hypoxia and the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway, a key transcription factor regulating glycolysis, angiogenesis and apoptosis, which is also linked with radioresistancetumor hypoxia and ability of cancer cells to undergo rapid repopulation during radiotherapy are associated with failure of radiotherapy. Tumors with low alpha/beta-ratio values or hypoxic tumors unable to undergo re-oxygenation, are unlikely to be eradicated with standard radiotherapy. Although the therapeutic efficacy of accelerated regimens based on low-dose per fraction may be high since they minimize the adverse role of rapid tumor repopulation, the cellular compartment with low alpha/beta-ratio values (i.e. hypoxic cells) remains a limiting factor.Amifostine (Ethyol) is a prodrug that must be dephosphorylated to the free thiol in which form it can detoxify free oxygen radicals generated by radiation, hypoxia and by drugs such anthracyclines, platinum analogues and alkylating agents. Amifostine as inactive prodrug is primarily metabolized at the tissue site by membrane alkaline phosphatase, which is highly active in the cell membranes of normal endothelial cells and biliary tree cells but not in the cell membranes and neovascular capillaries of tumor","answer":"After the administration of Prodrug amifostine the cells of the tissue prefer anaerobic glycolysis rather than regular cellular aerobic respiration.

Adaptation to hypoxia and maintenance of O (2) homeostasis involve a wide range of responses that occur at different organizational levels in the body. One of the most important transcription factors that activate the expression of O (2) -regulated genes is hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Nitric oxide (NO) mediates a variety of biological effects including relaxation of blood vessels and cytotoxicity of activated macrophages. We investigated the effect of the clinically used nitrates nitroglycerin (NTG), isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on HIF-1-mediated transcriptional responses to hypoxia. We demonstrate that among the three nitrates, only SNP inhibits HIF-1 activation in response to hypoxia. In contrast, NTG or ISDN does not affect HIF-1 activity. SNP inhibits the accumulation of HIF-1alpha, the regulatory subunit of HIF-1, and the transcriptional activation of HIF-1alpha via a mechanism that is not dependent on either NO or soluble guanylate cyclase.","answer":"[[\\"ISDN\\", \\"NOT\\", \\"HIF-1\\"], [\\"SNP\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"HIF-1alpha\\"], [\\"SNP\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"HIF-1alpha\\"], [\\"SNP\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"HIF-1\\"], [\\"sodium nitroprusside\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"HIF-1\\"], [\\"SNP\\", \\"NOT\\", \\"soluble guanylate cyclase\\"], [\\"NTG\\", \\"NOT\\", \\"HIF-1\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

In addition, a vectored vaccine often enables delivery of the vaccine to sites of inductive immunity such as the respiratory tract enabling protection from influenza virus infection. Moreover, the ability to readily manipulate virus vectors to produce novel influenza vaccines may provide the quickest path toward a universal vaccine protecting against all influenza viruses. This review will discuss experimental virus-vectored vaccines for use in humans, comparing them to licensed vaccines and the hurdles faced for licensure of these next-generation influenza virus vaccines. Text: Seasonal influenza is a worldwide health problem causing high mobility and substantial mortality [1] [2] [3] [4] . Moreover, influenza infection often worsens preexisting medical conditions [5] [6] [7] . Vaccines against circulating influenza strains are available and updated annually, but many issues are still present, including low efficacy in the populations at greatest risk of complications from influenza virus infection, i.e., the young and elderly [8, 9] . Despite increasing vaccination rates, influenza-related hospitalizations are increasing [8, 10] , and substantial drug resistance has developed to two of the four currently approved anti-viral drugs [11, 12] . While adjuvants have the potential to improve efficacy and availability of current inactivated vaccines, live-attenuated and virus-vectored vaccines are still considered one of the best options for the induction of broad and efficacious immunity to the influenza virus [13] . The general types of influenza vaccines available in the United States are trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV), quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV), and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV; in trivalent and quadrivalent forms). There are three types of inactivated vaccines that include whole virus inactivated, split virus inactivated, and subunit vaccines. In split virus vaccines, the virus is disrupted by a detergent. In subunit vaccines, HA and NA have been further purified by removal of other viral components. TIV is administered intramuscularly and contains three or four inactivated viruses, i.e., two type A strains (H1 and H3) and one or two type B strains. TIV efficacy is measured by induction of humoral responses to the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, the major surface and attachment glycoprotein on influenza. Serum antibody responses to HA are measured by the hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay, and the strain-specific HI titer is considered the gold-standard correlate of immunity to influenza where a four-fold increase in titer post-vaccination, or a HI titer of ≥1:40 is considered protective [4, 14] . Protection against clinical disease is mainly conferred by serum antibodies; however, mucosal IgA antibodies also may contribute to resistance against infection. Split virus inactivated vaccines can induce neuraminidase (NA)-specific antibody responses [15] [16] [17] , and anti-NA antibodies have been associated with protection from infection in humans [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Currently, NA-specific antibody responses are not considered a correlate of protection [14] . LAIV is administered as a nasal spray and contains the same three or four influenza virus strains as inactivated vaccines but on an attenuated vaccine backbone [4] . LAIV are temperature-sensitive and cold-adapted so they do not replicate effectively at core body temperature, but replicate in the mucosa of the nasopharynx [23] . LAIV immunization induces serum antibody responses, mucosal antibody responses (IgA), and T cell responses. While robust serum antibody and nasal wash (mucosal) antibody responses are associated with protection from infection, other immune responses, such as CD8 + cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) responses may contribute to protection and there is not a clear correlate of immunity for LAIV [4, 14, 24] . Currently licensed influenza virus vaccines suffer from a number of issues. The inactivated vaccines rely on specific antibody responses to the HA, and to a lesser extent NA proteins for protection. The immunodominant portions of the HA and NA molecules undergo a constant process of antigenic drift, a natural accumulation of mutations, enabling virus evasion from immunity [9, 25] . Thus, the circulating influenza A and B strains are reviewed annually for antigenic match with current vaccines, Replacement of vaccine strains may occur regularly, and annual vaccination is recommended to assure protection [4, 26, 27] . For the northern hemisphere, vaccine strain selection occurs in February and then manufacturers begin production, taking at least six months to produce the millions of vaccine doses required for the fall [27] . If the prediction is imperfect, or if manufacturers have issues with vaccine production, vaccine efficacy or availability can be compromised [28] . LAIV is not recommended for all populations; however, it is generally considered to be as effective as inactivated vaccines and may be more efficacious in children [4, 9, 24] . While LAIV relies on antigenic match and the HA and NA antigens are replaced on the same schedule as the TIV [4, 9] , there is some suggestion that LAIV may induce broader protection than TIV due to the diversity of the immune response consistent with inducing virus-neutralizing serum and mucosal antibodies, as well as broadly reactive T cell responses [9, 23, 29] . While overall both TIV and LAIV are considered safe and effective, there is a recognized need for improved seasonal influenza vaccines [26] . Moreover, improved understanding of immunity to conserved influenza virus antigens has raised the possibility of a universal vaccine, and these universal antigens will likely require novel vaccines for effective delivery [30] [31] [32] . Virus-vectored vaccines share many of the advantages of LAIV, as well as those unique to the vectors. Recombinant DNA systems exist that allow ready manipulation and modification of the vector genome. This in turn enables modification of the vectors to attenuate the virus or enhance immunogenicity, in addition to adding and manipulating the influenza virus antigens. Many of these vectors have been extensively studied or used as vaccines against wild type forms of the virus. Finally, each of these vaccine vectors is either replication-defective or causes a self-limiting infection, although like LAIV, safety in immunocompromised individuals still remains a concern [4, 13, [33] [34] [35] . Table 1 summarizes the benefits and concerns of each of the virus-vectored vaccines discussed here. There are 53 serotypes of adenovirus, many of which have been explored as vaccine vectors. A live adenovirus vaccine containing serotypes 4 and 7 has been in use by the military for decades, suggesting adenoviruses may be safe for widespread vaccine use [36] . However, safety concerns have led to the majority of adenovirus-based vaccine development to focus on replication-defective vectors. Adenovirus 5 (Ad5) is the most-studied serotype, having been tested for gene delivery and anti-cancer agents, as well as for infectious disease vaccines. Adenovirus vectors are attractive as vaccine vectors because their genome is very stable and there are a variety of recombinant systems available which can accommodate up to 10 kb of recombinant genetic material [37] . Adenovirus is a non-enveloped virus which is relatively stable and can be formulated for long-term storage at 4 °C, or even storage up to six months at room temperature [33] . Adenovirus vaccines can be grown to high titers, exceeding 10 1° plaque forming units (PFU) per mL when cultured on 293 or PER.C6 cells [38] , and the virus can be purified by simple methods [39] . Adenovirus vaccines can also be delivered via multiple routes, including intramuscular injection, subcutaneous injection, intradermal injection, oral delivery using a protective capsule, and by intranasal delivery. Importantly, the latter two delivery methods induce robust mucosal immune responses and may bypass preexisting vector immunity [33] . Even replication-defective adenovirus vectors are naturally immunostimulatory and effective adjuvants to the recombinant antigen being delivered. Adenovirus has been extensively studied as a vaccine vector for human disease. The first report using adenovirus as a vaccine vector for influenza demonstrated immunogenicity of recombinant adenovirus 5 (rAd5) expressing the HA of a swine influenza virus, A/Swine/Iowa/1999 (H3N2). Intramuscular immunization of mice with this construct induced robust neutralizing antibody responses and protected mice from challenge with a heterologous virus, A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2) [40] . Replication defective rAd5 vaccines expressing influenza HA have also been tested in humans. A rAd5-HA expressing the HA from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1; PR8) was delivered to humans epicutaneously or intranasally and assayed for safety and immunogenicity. The vaccine was well tolerated and induced seroconversion with the intranasal administration had a higher conversion rate and higher geometric meant HI titers [41] . While clinical trials with rAd vectors have overall been successful, demonstrating safety and some level of efficacy, rAd5 as a vector has been negatively overshadowed by two clinical trial failures. The first trial was a gene therapy examination where high-dose intravenous delivery of an Ad vector resulted in the death of an 18-year-old male [42, 43] . The second clinical failure was using an Ad5-vectored HIV vaccine being tested as a part of a Step Study, a phase 2B clinical trial. In this study, individuals were vaccinated with the Ad5 vaccine vector expressing HIV-1 gag, pol, and nef genes. The vaccine induced HIV-specific T cell responses; however, the study was stopped after interim analysis suggested the vaccine did not achieve efficacy and individuals with high preexisting Ad5 antibody titers might have an increased risk of acquiring HIV-1 [44] [45] [46] . Subsequently, the rAd5 vaccine-associated risk was confirmed [47] . While these two instances do not suggest Ad-vector vaccines are unsafe or inefficacious, the umbra cast by the clinical trials notes has affected interest for all adenovirus vaccines, but interest still remains. Immunization with adenovirus vectors induces potent cellular and humoral immune responses that are initiated through toll-like receptor-dependent and independent pathways which induce robust pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. Recombinant Ad vaccines expressing HA antigens from pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1), H5 and H7 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus (HPAIV), and H9 avian influenza viruses have been tested for efficacy in a number of animal models, including chickens, mice, and ferrets, and been shown to be efficacious and provide protection from challenge [48, 49] . Several rAd5 vectors have been explored for delivery of non-HA antigens, influenza nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix 2 (M2) protein [29, [50] [51] [52] . The efficacy of non-HA antigens has led to their inclusion with HA-based vaccines to improve immunogenicity and broaden breadth of both humoral and cellular immunity [53, 54] . However, as both CD8 + T cell and neutralizing antibody responses are generated by the vector and vaccine antigens, immunological memory to these components can reduce efficacy and limit repeated use [48] . One drawback of an Ad5 vector is the potential for preexisting immunity, so alternative adenovirus serotypes have been explored as vectors, particularly non-human and uncommon human serotypes. Non-human adenovirus vectors include those from non-human primates (NHP), dogs, sheep, pigs, cows, birds and others [48, 55] . These vectors can infect a variety of cell types, but are generally attenuated in humans avoiding concerns of preexisting immunity. Swine, NHP and bovine adenoviruses expressing H5 HA antigens have been shown to induce immunity comparable to human rAd5-H5 vaccines [33, 56] . Recombinant, replication-defective adenoviruses from low-prevalence serotypes have also been shown to be efficacious. Low prevalence serotypes such as adenovirus types 3, 7, 11, and 35 can evade anti-Ad5 immune responses while maintaining effective antigen delivery and immunogenicity [48, 57] . Prime-boost strategies, using DNA or protein immunization in conjunction with an adenovirus vaccine booster immunization have also been explored as a means to avoided preexisting immunity [52] . Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) were first explored as gene therapy vectors. Like rAd vectors, rAAV have broad tropism infecting a variety of hosts, tissues, and proliferating and non-proliferating cell types [58] . AAVs had been generally not considered as vaccine vectors because they were widely considered to be poorly immunogenic. A seminal study using AAV-2 to express a HSV-2 glycoprotein showed this virus vaccine vector effectively induced potent CD8 + T cell and serum antibody responses, thereby opening the door to other rAAV vaccine-associated studies [59, 60] . AAV vector systems have a number of engaging properties. The wild type viruses are non-pathogenic and replication incompetent in humans and the recombinant AAV vector systems are even further attenuated [61] . As members of the parvovirus family, AAVs are small non-enveloped viruses that are stable and amenable to long-term storage without a cold chain. While there is limited preexisting immunity, availability of non-human strains as vaccine candidates eliminates these concerns. Modifications to the vector have increased immunogenicity, as well [60] . There are limited studies using AAVs as vaccine vectors for influenza. An AAV expressing an HA antigen was first shown to induce protective in 2001 [62] . Later, a hybrid AAV derived from two non-human primate isolates (AAVrh32.33) was used to express influenza NP and protect against PR8 challenge in mice [63] .Question: What is the advantage of virus vectored vaccines?","answer":"virus vectors enable native expression of influenza antigens, even from virulent influenza viruses, while expressed in the context of the vector that can improve immunogenicity."},{"question":"How would you change the following Java code to print the first 5 prime numbers?public class PrimeNumberPrinter {    public static void printNumbers() {        System.out.println(\\"...\\");    }}","answer":"To print first five prime numbers, you would first need to implement a method to check if a number is prime or not. Then you can include a loop that goes through numbers from 2 onwards, and prints them if they\'re prime. Stop the loop after you\'ve found 5 primes. Here\'s how you could do it:```javapublic class PrimeNumberPrinter {    public static void printNumbers() {        int num = 2;        int count = 0;        while(count < 5) {            if(isPrime(num)) {                System.out.println(num);                count++;            }            num++;        }    }    public static boolean isPrime(int num) {        if ( num > 2 && num % 2 == 0 ) {            return false;        }        int top = (int)Math.sqrt(num) + 1;        for(int i = 3; i < top; i+=2){            if(num % i == 0){                return false;            }        }        return true;     }    public static void main(String[] args) {        printNumbers();    }}```In the code above, the function `isPrime()` to determines if a number is prime. It only checks up to the square root of the number, because a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked.The `printNumbers()` function iterates through numbers, and prints and increments the count each time it finds a prime, until it has found 5."},{"question":"Construct a Python code sequence that can proficiently perform the operation of producing the union of two separate and unique mathematical sets, ensuring the code is efficient and error-free.","answer":"Here is a Python code you can use to find the union of two unique sets:```pythondef union_of_sets(set_1, set_2):    return set_1.union(set_2)set_a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}set_b = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}union_result = union_of_sets(set_a, set_b)print(union_result)```When you run this code, it will print the union of `set_a` and `set_b`. This solution will work efficiently even for large sets. In Python, the `set.union()` method is used to get a set which contains all elements from both sets, where set is an unsorted collection data type that is iterable, mutable and does not allow duplication of elements."},{"question":"Design and implement a Python function that, upon being provided with a list comprising numerical elements, generates a predetermined quantity of distinct re-arrangements of the elements within the list.arr = [1, 2, 3]n = 6","answer":"Here is a Python function that uses the `itertools.permutations` function to generate distinct re-arrangements of a given list and then returns a predetermined amount of them specified by the parameter `n`.```pythonimport itertoolsdef generate_rearrangements(arr, n):    # Generate all permutations    permutations = list(itertools.permutations(arr))        # If the desired amount of permutations is greater than the total number of permutations    # Then catch this error and return a message.    if n > len(permutations):        return f\\"Cannot generate {n} permutations, the maximum for this list is {len(permutations)}\\"        # Return n permutations    return permutations[:n]arr = [1, 2, 3]n = 6print(generate_rearrangements(arr, n))```The `itertools.permutations` function returns an iterator that generates all permutations of the input iterable. Then, the desired amount of permutations is sliced from the list of permutations and returned.Note: Because the number of permutations of a list of length `n` is `n!`, it\'s important to ensure that the desired amount of permutations `n` is not greater than the total number of permutations. Otherwise, an error message is returned."},{"question":"How can you replace all punctuation in a given string with a specific sequence of characters, while also preserving the original spacing between words, in Python?

Here are a few methods to mitigate the problem:1. Smooth edges of screen fonts: In Windows, you can go to \'System > Advanced system settings > Performance Settings > Visual Effects\' and ensure that \'Smooth edges of screen fonts\' is checked.2. Cleartype settings: Adjust your ClearType settings. Windows comes with a tuner you can access in the control panel. Just search for \'ClearType\' and follow the prompts. This could potentially have a big impact on how your fonts render in all of your applications.3. Web Safe Fonts: Use \'web safe\' fonts.

This suggests that it\'s not a common approach or there could be compatibility issues. ADO.NET Data Services, officially known as WCF Data Services in .NET 4, is a component of the .NET Framework that allows for the creation and consumption of OData protocols for web-based data services. These data services can be consumed by client applications such as those written using Adobe Flex. While Adobe Flex supports consuming RESTful web services, it primarily works with XML-based web services SOAP, while ADO.NET Data Services can expose data in JSON and Atom format. Nevertheless, it is possible to consume OData services from Adobe Flex but it might require a lot of manual parsing or using a third-party library.Regarding security, usually, you should implement security at the service level. WCF Data Services does allow you to implement authentication and authorization. You can implement standard ASP.NET authentication methods like Forms Authentication or Windows Authentication. You can also implement various authorization levels by using Query Interceptors and Change Interceptors to control read/write access to resources.This is not a straightforward out-of-the-box solution unless you have a particular reason to use ADO.NET Data Services as a data source for an Adobe Flex application, it might be easier to look for other alternatives that are more commonly used with Flex applications."},{"question":"Design and implement a secure Python-based system to generate a resilient password.

It\'s vital to intertwine its distributed computing capabilities, the complexities encountered during the initialization phase, potential obstacles that might emerge during the distributed computing process, and the necessity of a methodical debugging strategy. Moreover, ponder the influence of these components on the model\'s cumulative accuracy and computational speed, considering the consequences of data cleansing and model verification in this context. Additionally, evaluate the significance of feature extraction and the potential implications of noticeable bias or variance on the model\'s effectiveness.","answer":"For brevity, we\'ll establish a specific type of model: a deep learning model for image recognition using convolutional neural networks (CNN) in the context of PyTorch and Amazon SageMaker. Initialization: Before creating any model on SageMaker, there are three critical steps: defining the model, loading datasets, and moving datasets to an S3 bucket. Definition of the model refers to designing the CNN\'s architecture, where we define the layers and their properties. In the initialization phase, the size of the datasets and their compatibility with the model structure are the principal concern.Distributed Computing Capabilities:Training deep learning models require significant computational resources. Tasks such as parallel parameter tuning, hyperparameter optimization, and advanced algorithms can have major impacts on computational speed and accuracy. SageMaker integrates with PyTorch to train models on multiple instances simultaneously. This is possible thanks to Amazon\'s Elastic Fabric Adapter, a network interface that enhances the communication speed between compute instances. Difficulties in Distributed Computing: Distributed computing is not without its challenges. Synchronization might emerge as a problem when training in distributed settings, leading to slower convergence. Also, certain errors may only surface when a model is executed across multiple nodes. Debugging these issues can be complex due to the fact that problems may not be reproducible on a single machine.Debugging & Verification: Debugging deep learning models trained on distributed systems can be challenging. SageMaker Debugger can help monitor system resource usage and model parameters during training. Set in place a debugging strategy that analyzes system errors, volume metrics, and consistency. This aids in detecting both software and hardware issues, optimizing model performance and reliability.Data Cleansing and Model Verification: Incomplete data, lack of variability, or skewed proportions in training data can lead to poor model performance. Data cleansing pre-speeds processing by removing data noise and redundancy. Model verification further ensures model performance by validating trained models against unseen data and checking for overfitting or underfitting. Feature Extraction: The effectiveness of a deep learning model also hinges upon the quality of feature extraction. Deep learning networks minimize the need for manual feature extraction, as they determine features themselves in the training phase.  Bias and Variance Implications: A good CNN model should adequately balance bias and variance. High bias leads your model to become oversimplified, resulting in low accuracy. On the other hand, high variance risks fitting too much to the training data, resulting in poor generalizability.In conclusion, building a complex, distributed deep learning model demands consideration into its distributed computing capabilities, combating potential issues regarding initialization and distributed computing, implementing systematic debugging, monitoring accuracy, data cleansing, model verification and feature extraction benefits. Furthermore, scrutiny of bias and variance is fundamental to maintaining a fine-tuned model."},{"question":"Propose an appropriate algorithmic data structure for archiving an extensive array of academic particulars pertaining to an educational institution\'s enrolled pupils.","answer":"A Data Structure recommended for holding such a complex structure of information like academic particulars pertaining to an enrolled students in an educational institution would be a combination of a dictionary (or Hash Map) and Lists in Python.Algorithm could be as follows:1. Create a main dictionary - maindict where each key will correspond to a unique identifier for the students, it could be the Student\'s ID. The value corresponding to this key will be another dictionary - studentdict 2. The Student dict will have keys as - Name, Age, Gender, Class, Grades, Subjects, etc. Any info that needs to be stored can be a key in this Student Dict. The value corresponding to each of these keys will be the actual info for the students. For \'Grades\' and \'Subjects\' - it can be lists where each element will represent the grade or subject of the student.3. Now, once the we have data for all students, it can be just added to the main dictionary - maindict with key as student\'s ID and value as the sub dictionary we generated.4. This data structure can hold any number of students data and their academic particulars.

If one of these numbers is given as 45, the other can be any of four options: 165, 46, 45, or 9. With this in mind, how would you determine the smallest possible integer value for the second number to satisfy this complex mathematical scenario?","answer":"First, observe that the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is always greater than or equal to the largest number. Thus, this rules out 165 as a potential second number as the LCM of 45 and 165 is not 33 times their greatest common divisor (GCD). Second, consider that the GCD is a divisor of both numbers. For the quotient of the LCM and GCD to be 33, the GCD must be a factor of 45 (the known number) that divides evenly into 33. However, 45\'s factors are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45, none of which divide evenly into 33. This indicates that the GCD must be 1, meaning the two numbers are co-prime (i.e., their only common positive integer factor is 1).Now let’s write python code to determine the smallest possible integer value for the second number.```pythonimport mathdef find_min_num(number, quotient):    i = 1    while True:         gcd = math.gcd(number, i)        lcm = abs(number*i)//gcd        if lcm//gcd == quotient:            return i        i += 1number = 45quotient = 33print(find_min_num(number, quotient))```This code uses the GCD and LCM definitions to find the smallest possible integer value for the second number. It starts from 1 and continually increments the second number until it satisfies the condition wherein the quotient of the LCM and GCD equals 33. The find_min_num function returns the minimum value for the second number that meets this requirement. When you run this code, it outputs 15, which implies that the second number should be 15 of the four options provided."},{"question":"Convert the following PostgreSQL query into the equivalent Cassandra Query Language (CQL) statement and also write an optimized version for the same result.SELECT * FROM products WHERE quantity > 50 AND price < 200 ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 5","answer":"Cassandra Query Language (CQL) does not natively support the \\"ORDER BY\\" clause on non-primary key columns, and it doesn\'t support inequality operations for the \\"WHERE\\" clause on any columns that are not part of the primary key too.So in order to convert the PostgreSQL query to CQL, we\'d need to model our database considering these restrictions. Also, it\'s important to note that Cassandra doesn\'t encourage the use of SELECT * due to performance reasons. So, you\'re supposed to explicitly name the columns that you wish to select.Assuming \'product_id\' is the primary key, and that product_id, price, and quantity are the only columns for simplicity.Step 1: Create a table that makes the price column as the primary key columnWe need to have price as a primary key to use ORDER BY and also we can\'t use WHERE quantity > 50 directly as CQL doesn\'t support it.So we need to manually filter out the results which have quantity <= 50.```CREATE TABLE products_by_price (    product_id int,    quantity int,    price int,    PRIMARY KEY((price), product_id)) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (product_id ASC);```Step 2: Insert Data. Ensure you have data with the \'quantity\' > 50.Step 3: Use the below CQL query statement to get the desired data:```SELECT * FROM products_by_price WHERE price < 200 ALLOW FILTERING;```This will filter out the products with price > 200. Next, we must handle the \'quantity > 50\' in our application code, as CQL does not support this feature natively.For optimization, as Cassandra discourages the use of SELECT * due to performance reasons, you should only select the columns that you want. Limiting the number of columns in the SELECT statement reduces the amount of data transferred over the network and thus increases performance. Similarly, using ALLOW FILTERING can be harmful in performance terms as it could potentially scan all your partitions, so it is recommended only in situations where the amount of data to be filtered is known to be small."},{"question":"What is the best way to implement a stack or a queue in Python? Additionally, the stack or queue must be able to handle a load of 10,000 operations, and have time and space complexities better than O(n2).","answer":"Python provides higher level abstractions for implementing stack and queue data structures, which perform well for large amounts of operations.

The approach to solve this problem is simple. One stack will be used for pushing all elements and the other will be used for popping. If the pop stack is empty, we move all our elements from the push stack to our pop stack, reversing the order of the items.```pythonclass PriorityQueue:    def __init__(self):        self._pushStack = []        self._popStack = []    def push(self, item):        # Push in decreasing order into the push stack        while len(self._pushStack) != 0 and self._pushStack[-1] > item:            self._popStack.append(self._pushStack.pop())        self._pushStack.append(item)        while self._popStack:            self._pushStack.append(self._popStack.pop())    def pop(self):        if not self._pushStack and not self._popStack:            return \'Queue is empty!\'        # If the pop stack is empty, we move all our items from the push stack to our pop stack.        # This will reverse the order which is what we want        if not self._popStack:            while self._pushStack:                self._popStack.append(self._pushStack.pop())        return self._popStack.pop()    def is_empty(self):        return len(self._pushStack) == 0 and len(self._popStack) == 0```Instance of PriorityQueue:```pythonPQ = PriorityQueue()PQ.push(3)PQ.push(1)PQ.push(6)PQ.push(7)PQ.push(2)print(PQ.pop())  # 7print(PQ.pop())  # 6print(PQ.pop())  # 3PQ.push(5)print(PQ.pop())  # 5print(PQ.pop())  # 2print(PQ.pop())  # 1print(PQ.pop())  # \'Queue is empty!\'```When pushing items, it keeps moving the larger ones onto the second stack, and when popping items, it empties the second stack first, if it\'s nonempty, thus ensuring that items are always popped in order of priority.  Note: This implementation will not remove duplicates, as each push operation will consider the item as a new entry. To remove duplicates, you might want to choose different data structures such as heaps, or having extra functionality in PriorityQueue class to prevent duplicates."},{"question":"I\'ve run into a situation where we have 2 tables that have 2 different foreign key relationships, one is 1-many, the other is 1-1, but they are in opposite directions.

And then you would use this function in a check constraint.Here is a sample implementation:```sqlCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_valid_vendor_product(vendor_product_id integer, product_id integer) RETURNS BOOLEAN ASBEGIN    RETURN EXISTS (        SELECT 1        FROM vendor_product        WHERE id = vendor_product_id AND product_id = product_id    );END LANGUAGE plpgsql;ALTER TABLE product    ADD CONSTRAINT valid_preferred_vendor_product_id     CHECK (is_valid_vendor_product(preferred_vendor_product, id));```This function takes `vendor_product_id` and `product_id` as arguments, and it returns true if there exists a `vendor_product` with the same `id` as `vendor_product_id` and the same `product_id` as `product_id`.The check constraint `valid_preferred_vendor_product_id` uses this function to ensure that whenever a new `product` is inserted or an existing `product` is updated, the `vendor_product_id` must correspond to a `vendor_product` that has the same `product_id` as the `product`\'s `id`.Please note, this is pseudo code and may require adaptation to your specific schema and conditions. Always test procedures in a controlled environment prior to deployment."},{"question":"How can I make this SVG look like it\'s carved out of a mountainside?<svg width=\\"32\\" height=\\"32\\" viewBox=\\"0 0 32 32\\" fill=\\"none\\" xmlns=\\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\"><path d=\\"M20 9L22 6H27V9H30V15L22 16L14 15L15.5646 9.43999C15.6335 9.17999 15.8696 9 16.1353 9H20Z\\" fill=\\"#CDC4D6\\"/><path d=\\"M22 16H30V23L17 26L4 23L2.03838 17.2837C1.85708 16.6418 2.34056 16 3.01543 16H22Z\\" fill=\\"#CDC4D6\\"/><path d=\\"M24.66 12.99H25.33C25.7 12.99 25.99 12.69 25.99 12.33V11.66C25.99 11.29 25.69 11 25.33 11H24.66C24.29 11 24 11.3 24 11.66V12.33C24 12.7 24.29 12.99 24.66 12.99Z\\" fill=\\"#26EAFC\\"/><path d=\\"M4 23L5.801 29.2731C5.9204 29.7013 6.31841 30 6.76617 30H28.995C29.5522 30 30 29.5519 30 29.0043V23H4Z\\" fill=\\"#CA0B4A\\"/><path d=\\"M21 11C21.54 11 22 11 22 12C22 12.9821 21.5563 12.99 21.0289 12.9995L21 13H14.5665L15.1242 11H21Z\\" fill=\\"#00A6ED\\"/><path d=\\"M15.3362 21H14.6638C14.3017 21 14 20.6983 14 20.3362V19.6638C14 19.3017 14.2931 19 14.6638 19H15.3362C15.6983 19 16 19.2931 16 19.6638V20.3362C16 20.6983 15.7069 21 15.3362 21Z\\" fill=\\"#00A6ED\\"/><path d=\\"M18.6638 21H19.3362C19.7069 21 20 20.6983 20 20.3362V19.6638C20 19.2931 19.6983 19 19.3362 19H18.6638C18.2931 19 18 19.3017 18 19.6638V20.3362C18 20.6983 18.2931 21 18.6638 21Z\\" fill=\\"#00A6ED\\"/><path d=\\"M23.3362 21H22.6638C22.2931 21 22 20.6983 22 20.3362V19.6638C22 19.3017 22.2931 19 22.6638 19H23.3362C23.6983 19 24 19.2931 24 19.6638V20.3362C24 20.6983 23.7069 21 23.3362 21Z\\" fill=\\"#00A6ED\\"/><path d=\\"M26.6638 21H27.3362C27.7069 21 28 20.6983 28 20.3362V19.6638C28 19.2931 27.6983 19 27.3362 19H26.6638C26.2931 19 26 19.3017 26 19.6638V20.3362C26 20.6983 26.2931 21 26.6638 21Z\\" fill=\\"#00A6ED\\"/><path d=\\"M25.33 12.99H24.66C24.29 12.99 24 12.7 24 12.33V11.66C24 11.3 24.29 11 24.66 11H25.33C25.69 11 25.99 11.29 25.99 11.66V12.33C25.99 12.69 25.7 12.99 25.33 12.99Z\\" fill=\\"#00A6ED\\"/><path d=\\"M30.01 27.6699C28.26 27.6699 28.26 28.7899 26.5 28.7899C24.75 28.7899 24.75 27.6699 22.99 27.6699C21.24 27.6699 21.24 28.7899 19.49 28.7899C17.74 28.7899 17.74 27.6699 15.99 27.6699C14.24 27.6699 14.24 28.7899 12.49 28.7899C10.74 28.7899 10.74 27.6699 8.99 27.6699C7.24 27.6699 7.24 28.7899 5.5 28.7899C3.75 28.7899 3.75 27.6699 2 27.6699V29.9899H30L30.01 27.6699Z\\" fill=\\"#00A6ED\\"/><path d=\\"M26.5962 4C26.8077 4 26.9904 4.18091 26.9904 4.41206H27V6H22L22.6635 4.84422C22.9615 4.3216 23.5096 4 24.0962 4H26.5962Z\\" fill=\\"#533566\\"/><path d=\\"M5 16H30V15H5.58C5.26 15 5 15.2626 5 15.5859V16Z\\" fill=\\"#533566\\"/></svg>","answer":"You can provide a carved appearance by adding shadows, gradients, and texture to your SVG.

It does this by generating Fibonacci numbers starting from 0 and 1 until it finds a Fibonacci number that is greater or equal to `n`. If it finds a Fibonacci number equal to `n`, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is in the Fibonacci sequence.The function `filter_list` goes through the list and checks if an item is a Fibonacci number and divisible by 7 using `is_fibonacci` and `%`, respectively. If both conditions are true, the item is not included in the returned list (filtered out) with the use of list comprehension. It also filters out items that are not integers using `type(i) == int`.For example, with the input `[28, 12, 49, 33, \\"Apple\\", False]`, the function `filter_list` first checks if each item is an integer. \\"Apple\\" and False are not integers, so they are filtered out.

Two series of experiments were performed in order to compare the ability of different cationic antiseptics to inhibit the acid production in plaque. In addition an attempt was made to evaluate the influence of oral retention on the acid-inhibiting properties of these agents. In one series of experiments acid production, following sucrose applications on plaque, was measured in situ prior to and at given time intervals after rinsing with the individual agents. In a second series the effect of eluting the antiseptics retained in the oral cavity by means of 5 consecutive acetic acid (6 mM) rinses was evaluated. The results showed that chlorhexidine ( 0.5 mM ) was more effective than benzalkonium chloride ( 1 mM ) and piperazine ( 1 mM ) . cetylpyridinium chloride (1 mM) was the least effective. Acidic elution markedly reduced the inhibitory effect of single rinses of chlorhexidine (0.5 mM), benzalkonium chloride (1 mM) and the cetylpyridinium chloride (1 mM). This effect was less pronounced with a higher concentration (2.2 mM) of chlorhexidine.

In recent years it has been recognized that clinical translation of novel therapeutic strategies for patients with adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) often fails. These disappointing results indicate that the currently utilized tumor models only poorly reflect relevant pathophysiology and, thereby, do not predict clinical applicability of novel pharmacological approaches. However, also the development of new preclinical ACC models has remained a challenge with only one human cell line (NCI-H295R) and one recently established human pediatric xenograft model (SJ-ACC3) being available for this highly heterogeneous malignancy. Our current study furthermore reveals a poor reproducibility of therapeutic action between different clones of the most commonly used tumor model NCI-H295R. In an attempt to broaden the current preclinical armamentarium, we aimed at the development of patient-individual tumor models. During these studies, one xenograft (MUC-1) displayed marked engraftment and sustained tumor growth. MUC-1 tumor analysis revealed highly vascularized, proliferating and SF-1 positive xenografts. In a next step, we characterized all currently available human tumor models for ACC for Ki67, SF-1 and EGF-receptor status in comparison with MUC-1-xenografts. In addition, we established a primary culture, which is now viable over 31 passages with sustained nuclear SF-1 and cytoplasmic 3βHSD immuno-positivity. Subsequent investigation of therapeutic responsiveness upon treatment with the current systemic gold standard EDP-M ( etoposide , doxorubicin , cisplatin and mitotane ) demonstrated maintenance of the clinically observed drug resistance for MUC-1 exclusively . In summary, we provide evidence for a novel patient-derived tumor model with the potential to improve clinical prediction of novel therapeutic strategies for patients with ACC.sentence: Subsequent investigation of therapeutic responsiveness upon treatment with the current systemic gold standard EDP-M ( etoposide , doxorubicin , cisplatin and mitotane ) demonstrated maintenance of the clinically observed drug resistance for MUC-1 exclusively .","answer":"[[\\"etoposide\\", \\"doxorubicin\\", \\"cisplatin\\", \\"mitotane\\", \\"POS\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Although the prevalence of small poultry flocks has increased in Alberta, Canada, in recent years, there is minimal demographic information available for these populations. To gain initial epidemiologic insight into this growing population and potential areas of risk, a survey was conducted to characterize the sector. Information on flock demographics and bird health, as well as production and biosecurity practices, were gathered and analyzed from 206 surveys, representing respondents from 43 counties. These results revealed great diversity of both owners and flocks, characterized by wide variations in flock sizes and composition. Laying hens were the most commonly reported type of bird (93.4%), followed by ducks and geese (35.3%), turkeys, (33.8%), and broiler chickens (33.1%). Notably, 58.1% of owners reported having more than one type of bird in their flock, with many owners never, or only sometimes, separating flocks based on species or purpose. Personal consumption (81.8%) and sale of eggs (48.2%) were the most frequently cited purposes for owning a flock. Our findings suggest that owners in Alberta are predominantly new to production; most (73.1%) have kept birds for less than 5 yr and 25.6% for less than 1 yr. Flock health parameters revealed inconsistent use of medical interventions, such as vaccinations, treatments, and veterinary consultation. Data on the sourcing, housing, and movement of birds, as well as movement of people and visitors, reveal substantial potential for contact to occur directly and indirectly between flocks and humans. Additionally, basic husbandry and biosecurity practices were found to be inconsistent and often inadequate, highlighting important gaps and opportunities to improve the health of Alberta\'s small poultry flocks and mitigate risks to public health. These quantitative and qualitative results provide a baseline characterization of the sector and identify risks and challenges that may serve to inform the development and delivery of future study and interventions.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"zoonoses\\", \\"avian diseases\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [\\"public health concern\\"], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"geese\\", \\"broiler chickens\\", \\"turkeys\\", \\"Poultry\\", \\"bird\\", \\"ducks\\", \\"birds\\", \\"poultry\\", \\"Laying hens\\", \\"humans\\"], \\"Finding\\": [], \\"Food\\": [\\"eggs\\"], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"vaccinations\\", \\"treatments\\", \\"public health\\", \\"medical interventions\\", \\"veterinary consultation\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"survey\\", \\"surveys\\", \\"demographic information\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"visitors\\", \\"population\\", \\"owners\\", \\"populations\\", \\"people\\", \\"respondents\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"demographics\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"Albertau0027s\\", \\"backyard\\", \\"counties\\", \\"sector\\", \\"Canada\\", \\"Alberta\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

Abnormal layout of cortical areas may disrupt sensory function and behavior. Developmental genetic mechanisms specify primary areas, but mechanisms influencing higher order area properties are unknown. By exploiting gain-of and loss-of function mouse models of the transcription factor Emx2, we have generated bi-directional changes in primary visual cortex size in vivo and have used it as a model to show a novel and prominent function for genetic mechanisms regulating primary visual area size and also proportionally dictating the sizes of surrounding higher order visual areas. This finding redefines the role for intrinsic genetic mechanisms to concomitantly specify and scale primary and related higher order sensory areas in a linear fashion.Introduction:The mouse neocortex is patterned into functionally distinct fields that include the primary sensory areas( visual, somatosensory and auditory), which receive modality-specific sensory inputs from thalamocortical axons( TCAs) originating from nuclei of the dorsal thalamus( O\'Leary et al., 2013). In the cortex, the connections of TCAs establish precise topographic representations( or maps) of the sensory periphery( Krubitzer and Kaas, 2005; O\'Leary et al., 2013). Primary areas are flanked by higher order sensory areas( HO), which are interconnected with them and also contain topographic maps( Felleman and Van Essen, 1991). In mammals, this evolutionarily conserved general layout of the intra-areal neural circuits is responsible for the orderly progression of sensory information, sensory perception and the integration of higher cortical functions( Felleman and Van Essen, 1991; Geschwind and Rakic, 2013; Krubitzer and Kaas, 2005; Laramée and Boire, 2014; O\'Leary et al., 2013). Disrupted layouts of cortical area layouts appear to be associated with neurodevelopmental disorders including autism( Courchesne et al., 2011; Voineagu et al., 2011). Studies of cortical arealization, the mechanisms that pattern the neocortex into areas, have focused almost exclusively on the primary areas and have led to the prevailing model that genetic mechanisms intrinsic to the neocortex control arealization during early cortical development( Greig et al., 2013; Krubitzer and Kaas, 2005; O\'Leary et al., 2013). For example, the graded expression of the homeodomain transcription factor Emx2 in neocortical progenitors determines the size and position of the primary visual area( V1) in mice( Bishop et al., 2000; Hamasaki et al., 2004). Although higher order areas outnumber primary areas by roughly 10-fold( Marshel et al., 2011; Wang and Burkhalter, 2007), mechanisms that specify them and define their proportions relative to primary areas have yet to be explored.Discussion:The present findings address the mechanisms that specify and regulate the size of higher order sensory areas, an issue that has been largely neglected. They reveal a novel, prominent role for intrinsic genetic information in this process. Genetically altering the size of V1 over a range of ~80% of its normal size using a Emx2 gain-of function mouse line and a novel conditional Emx2 loss-of function mouse line showed that the specification of both primary and related higher order cortical areas during development was linearly scaled by driving the unique properties that characterize both, V1 and higher order visual areas. Regardless of whether V1 was larger or smaller than in wt mice, related HO exhibited normal cytoarchitecture, genetic profiles, functional properties, and characteristic patterns of connectivity that resulted in an overall uniformly altered ‘visual cortical field’ in the occipital cortex that remained accurately and proportionally subdivided into V1 and higher order visual areas. This demonstrates that Emx2( and perhaps additional intrinsic area patterning regulators) specify a ‘sensory cortical field’ that includes primary and higher order areas and a defined border between them. This model of cortical area patterning is not consistent with the possibility that the core properties of primary and higher order areas are specified sequentially or through parallel genetic mechanisms. Our results further reveal that higher order areas do not have a fixed size. Rather their relative size is flexible. By using mouse models with bi-directional changes of V1 size as a model, our study revealed that higher order areas scale linearly together with their related primary sensory areas, This observation is important for at least two reasons:( i) it re-emphasizes a sequential model of primary sensory area formation that likewise influences the properties of related higher order areas. In this model, cortical intrinsic mechanisms specify all generic primary and higher order visual cortex properties during early development. Much later during postnatal development, geniculocortical input is needed to terminally differentiate the genetic distinctions between V1 and HO( Chou et al., 2013; Vue et al., 2013).( ii) It contradicts the hypothesis that cortical structure/function evolution mainly is driven by a disproportionate increase in the size of related higher order areas relative to primary areas. To the contrary, our results show that primary and related higher order areas remain proportionate when primary area size is altered through genetic mechanisms, suggesting that an increase in the complexity of connections and micro-circuits among higher order cortical processing centers likely accounts for gains in cortical functions that are characteristic for gyrencephalic mammals with larger cortical surface areas, compared to simpler lissencephalic mammals. In summary, the newly discovered linear scaling relationship between primary and related higher order areas has major implications for the basic understanding of the development and organization of the neocortical bauplan and its evolution and variability in normal and affected conditions.","answer":"The neocortex is the most recently evolved part of the human brain . It is associated with higher thought processes , including language and the processing of information from our senses . Anatomically , the neocortex is organised into different regions called ‘primary areas’ and ‘higher order areas’ , and perturbations to this organisation are associated with disorders such as autism . There are many more higher order areas than primary areas in a mammalian brain . But , while primary areas are known to be specified by developmental genes in the embryo , little is known about how the development of higher order areas is controlled . Recent findings suggested that primary areas might themselves influence the emergence of higher order areas via a series of developmental events . Now , Zembrzycki , Stocker et al . have investigated the developmental mechanisms that organise the mouse neocortex into its different regions . The experiments involved mouse mutants that produce either too much or too little of a protein called Emx2 . This protein is known to determine the size and position of the primary visual area ( commonly called V1 ) during embryonic development . In the mutant mice with too much Emx2 , the primary visual area was about 150% larger than it should be , even though the neocortex was a normal size . Zembrzycki , Stocker et al . then went on to show that the higher order areas associated with the primary visual area also grew proportionally larger in these mutant mice . The opposite was true for mice that didn’t produce Emx2 in their brains , and these mice had a much smaller primary visual area than normal mice . Together , these findings reveal a previously unknown linear relationship between the size of the primary visual area and higher order visual areas that is controlled by the genes that pattern the neocortex during development . This and other new insights will inform future studies of the development and organization of the neocortex and our understanding of how it evolved ."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The HMGI family of proteins consists of three members, HMGIC, HMGI and HMGI (Y), that function as architectural factors and are essential components of the enhancesome. HMGIC is predominantly expressed in proliferating, undifferentiated mesenchymal cells and is not detected in adult tissues. It is disrupted and misexpressed in a number of mesenchymal tumour cell types, including fat-cell tumours (lipomas). In addition Hmgic-/- mice have a deficiency in fat tissue. To study its role in adipogenesis and obesity, we examined Hmgic expression in the adipose tissue of adult, obese mice. Mice with a partial or complete deficiency of Hmgic resisted diet-induced obesity. Disruption of Hmgic caused a reduction in the obesity induced by leptin deficiency (Lepob/Lepob) in a gene-dose-dependent manner. Our studies implicate a role for HMGIC in fat-cell proliferation, indicating that it may be an adipose-specific target for the treatment of obesity..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"obese\\", \\"partial or complete deficiency of Hmgic\\", \\"fat-cell tumours\\", \\"obesity\\", \\"mesenchymal tumour\\", \\"lipomas\\", \\"leptin deficiency\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

The monoaminergic neuron, in particular the dopaminergic neuron, is central to mediating the hedonic and addictive properties of drugs of abuse. The effects of amphetamine (AMPH) and cocaine (COC), for example, depend on the ability to increase dopamine in the synapse, by effects on either the plasma membrane transporter DAT or the vesicular transporter for monoamine storage, VMAT2. The potential role of DAT as a target for AMPH and COC has been reviewed extensively. Here, we present VMAT2 as a target that enables the rewarding and addictive actions of these drugs, based on imaging, neurochemical, biochemical, cell biological, genetic, and immunohistochemical evidence. The presence of VMAT2 in noradrenergic, serotoninergic, histaminergic, and potentially trace aminergic neurons invites consideration of a wider role for aminergic neurotransmission in AMPH and COC abuse and addiction.","answer":"[[\\"AMPH\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"VMAT2\\"], [\\"AMPH\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"DAT\\"], [\\"COC\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"VMAT2\\"], [\\"amphetamine\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"DAT\\"], [\\"cocaine\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"VMAT2\\"], [\\"COC\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"DAT\\"], [\\"amphetamine\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"VMAT2\\"], [\\"cocaine\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"DAT\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of osteopontin silencing on the invasion and apoptosis of U251 cells. METHODS: The invasion, apoptosis and levels of uPA, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were determined by invasion assay, flow cytometry, Western blot and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR respectively. RESULTS: Osteopontin small interference RNA (siRNA) inhibited osteopontin expression and cell invasion, promoted apoptosis in U251 cells. In addition, the expression of Bcl-2, uPA, MMP-2 and MMP-9 was decreased, while Bax level was elevated. CONCLUSION: Osteopontin siRNA can inhibit U251 cells invasion via the down-regulation of uPA, MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels, and promote apoptosis through induction of Bax expression and inhibition of Bcl 2 level. It suggests that osteopontin plays an important role in human glioma progression.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"cell\\", \\"glioma\\", \\"glioma cell\\", \\"U251 cells\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

We previously reported that a single dose of ethanol (1.4 g/kg), yielding a blood alcohol concentration of 100 mg/dl, significantly impairs angiogenesis in murine wounds, despite adequate levels of VEGF, suggesting direct effects of ethanol on endothelial cell signaling (40). To examine the mechanism by which ethanol influences angiogenesis in wounds, we employed two different in vitro angiogenesis assays to determine whether acute ethanol exposure (100 mg/dl) would have long-lasting effects on VEGF-induced capillary network formation. Ethanol exposure resulted in reduced VEGF-induced cord formation on collagen and reduced capillary network structure on Matrigel in vitro. In addition, ethanol exposure decreased expression of endothelial VEGF receptor-2, as well as VEGF receptor-2 phosphorylation in vitro. Inhibition of ethanol metabolism by 4-methylpyrazole partially abrogated the effect of ethanol on endothelial cell cord formation. However, mice treated with t-butanol, an alcohol not metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase, exhibited no change in wound vascularity. These results suggest that products of ethanol metabolism are important factors in the development of ethanol-induced changes in endothelial cell responsiveness to VEGF. In vivo, ethanol exposure caused both decreased angiogenesis and increased hypoxia in wounds. Moreover, in vitro experiments demonstrated a direct effect of ethanol on the response to hypoxia in endothelial cells, as ethanol diminished nuclear hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha protein levels. Together, the data establish that acute ethanol exposure significantly impairs angiogenesis and suggest that this effect is mediated by changes in endothelial cell responsiveness to both VEGF and hypoxia.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"wounds\\", \\"cord\\", \\"capillary network\\", \\"cell\\", \\"endothelial cells\\", \\"endothelial cell\\", \\"endothelial cell cord\\", \\"endothelial\\", \\"nuclear\\", \\"blood\\", \\"wound\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

Instead, using CSS3 rotate transforms or JavaScript libraries such as D3.js for complex transformations might be useful. However, SVG does have a <textPath> element that lets you align text to a path, including a circular path. Here is a brief example:```html<svg>  <path id=\\"circlePath\\" d=\\"M50,50 m-40,0 a 40,40 0 1,0 80,0 a 40,40 0 1,0 -80,0\\"></path>  <text x=\\"50\\" y=\\"50\\">    <textPath href=\\"#circlePath\\">      This text follows a circle    </textPath>  </text></svg>```In the above, a path identified as circlePath is defined to be a circular path centered on (50,50).

Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: Protection against clinical disease is mainly conferred by serum antibodies; however, mucosal IgA antibodies also may contribute to resistance against infection . Split virus inactivated vaccines can induce neuraminidase (NA)-specific antibody responses [15] [16] [17] , and anti-NA antibodies have been associated with protection from infection in humans [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Currently, NA-specific antibody responses are not considered a correlate of protection [14] . LAIV is administered as a nasal spray and contains the same three or four influenza virus strains as inactivated vaccines but on an attenuated vaccine backbone [4] . LAIV are temperature-sensitive and cold-adapted so they do not replicate effectively at core body temperature, but replicate in the mucosa of the nasopharynx [23] . LAIV immunization induces serum antibody responses, mucosal antibody responses (IgA), and T cell responses. While robust serum antibody and nasal wash (mucosal) antibody responses are associated with protection from infection, other immune responses, such as CD8 + cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) responses may contribute to protection and there is not a clear correlate of immunity for LAIV [4, 14, 24] . Currently licensed influenza virus vaccines suffer from a number of issues. The inactivated vaccines rely on specific antibody responses to the HA, and to a lesser extent NA proteins for protection. The immunodominant portions of the HA and NA molecules undergo a constant process of antigenic drift, a natural accumulation of mutations, enabling virus evasion from immunity [9, 25] . Thus, the circulating influenza A and B strains are reviewed annually for antigenic match with current vaccines, Replacement of vaccine strains may occur regularly, and annual vaccination is recommended to assure protection [4, 26, 27] . For the northern hemisphere, vaccine strain selection occurs in February and then manufacturers begin production, taking at least six months to produce the millions of vaccine doses required for the fall [27] . If the prediction is imperfect, or if manufacturers have issues with vaccine production, vaccine efficacy or availability can be compromised [28] . LAIV is not recommended for all populations; however, it is generally considered to be as effective as inactivated vaccines and may be more efficacious in children [4, 9, 24] . While LAIV relies on antigenic match and the HA and NA antigens are replaced on the same schedule as the TIV [4, 9] , there is some suggestion that LAIV may induce broader protection than TIV due to the diversity of the immune response consistent with inducing virus-neutralizing serum and mucosal antibodies, as well as broadly reactive T cell responses [9, 23, 29] . While overall both TIV and LAIV are considered safe and effective, there is a recognized need for improved seasonal influenza vaccines [26] . Moreover, improved understanding of immunity to conserved influenza virus antigens has raised the possibility of a universal vaccine, and these universal antigens will likely require novel vaccines for effective delivery [30] [31] [32] . Virus-vectored vaccines share many of the advantages of LAIV, as well as those unique to the vectors. Recombinant DNA systems exist that allow ready manipulation and modification of the vector genome. This in turn enables modification of the vectors to attenuate the virus or enhance immunogenicity, in addition to adding and manipulating the influenza virus antigens. Many of these vectors have been extensively studied or used as vaccines against wild type forms of the virus. Finally, each of these vaccine vectors is either replication-defective or causes a self-limiting infection, although like LAIV, safety in immunocompromised individuals still remains a concern [4, 13, [33] [34] [35] . Table 1 summarizes the benefits and concerns of each of the virus-vectored vaccines discussed here. There are 53 serotypes of adenovirus, many of which have been explored as vaccine vectors. A live adenovirus vaccine containing serotypes 4 and 7 has been in use by the military for decades, suggesting adenoviruses may be safe for widespread vaccine use [36] . However, safety concerns have led to the majority of adenovirus-based vaccine development to focus on replication-defective vectors. Adenovirus 5 (Ad5) is the most-studied serotype, having been tested for gene delivery and anti-cancer agents, as well as for infectious disease vaccines. Adenovirus vectors are attractive as vaccine vectors because their genome is very stable and there are a variety of recombinant systems available which can accommodate up to 10 kb of recombinant genetic material [37] . Adenovirus is a non-enveloped virus which is relatively stable and can be formulated for long-term storage at 4 °C, or even storage up to six months at room temperature [33] . Adenovirus vaccines can be grown to high titers, exceeding 10 1° plaque forming units (PFU) per mL when cultured on 293 or PER.C6 cells [38] , and the virus can be purified by simple methods [39] . Adenovirus vaccines can also be delivered via multiple routes, including intramuscular injection, subcutaneous injection, intradermal injection, oral delivery using a protective capsule, and by intranasal delivery. Importantly, the latter two delivery methods induce robust mucosal immune responses and may bypass preexisting vector immunity [33] . Even replication-defective adenovirus vectors are naturally immunostimulatory and effective adjuvants to the recombinant antigen being delivered. Adenovirus has been extensively studied as a vaccine vector for human disease. The first report using adenovirus as a vaccine vector for influenza demonstrated immunogenicity of recombinant adenovirus 5 (rAd5) expressing the HA of a swine influenza virus, A/Swine/Iowa/1999 (H3N2). Intramuscular immunization of mice with this construct induced robust neutralizing antibody responses and protected mice from challenge with a heterologous virus, A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2) [40] . Replication defective rAd5 vaccines expressing influenza HA have also been tested in humans. A rAd5-HA expressing the HA from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1; PR8) was delivered to humans epicutaneously or intranasally and assayed for safety and immunogenicity. The vaccine was well tolerated and induced seroconversion with the intranasal administration had a higher conversion rate and higher geometric meant HI titers [41] . While clinical trials with rAd vectors have overall been successful, demonstrating safety and some level of efficacy, rAd5 as a vector has been negatively overshadowed by two clinical trial failures. The first trial was a gene therapy examination where high-dose intravenous delivery of an Ad vector resulted in the death of an 18-year-old male [42, 43] . The second clinical failure was using an Ad5-vectored HIV vaccine being tested as a part of a Step Study, a phase 2B clinical trial. In this study, individuals were vaccinated with the Ad5 vaccine vector expressing HIV-1 gag, pol, and nef genes. The vaccine induced HIV-specific T cell responses; however, the study was stopped after interim analysis suggested the vaccine did not achieve efficacy and individuals with high preexisting Ad5 antibody titers might have an increased risk of acquiring HIV-1 [44] [45] [46] . Subsequently, the rAd5 vaccine-associated risk was confirmed [47] . While these two instances do not suggest Ad-vector vaccines are unsafe or inefficacious, the umbra cast by the clinical trials notes has affected interest for all adenovirus vaccines, but interest still remains. Immunization with adenovirus vectors induces potent cellular and humoral immune responses that are initiated through toll-like receptor-dependent and independent pathways which induce robust pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. Recombinant Ad vaccines expressing HA antigens from pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1), H5 and H7 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus (HPAIV), and H9 avian influenza viruses have been tested for efficacy in a number of animal models, including chickens, mice, and ferrets, and been shown to be efficacious and provide protection from challenge [48, 49] . Several rAd5 vectors have been explored for delivery of non-HA antigens, influenza nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix 2 (M2) protein [29, [50] [51] [52] . The efficacy of non-HA antigens has led to their inclusion with HA-based vaccines to improve immunogenicity and broaden breadth of both humoral and cellular immunity [53, 54] . However, as both CD8 + T cell and neutralizing antibody responses are generated by the vector and vaccine antigens, immunological memory to these components can reduce efficacy and limit repeated use [48] . One drawback of an Ad5 vector is the potential for preexisting immunity, so alternative adenovirus serotypes have been explored as vectors, particularly non-human and uncommon human serotypes. Non-human adenovirus vectors include those from non-human primates (NHP), dogs, sheep, pigs, cows, birds and others [48, 55] . These vectors can infect a variety of cell types, but are generally attenuated in humans avoiding concerns of preexisting immunity. Swine, NHP and bovine adenoviruses expressing H5 HA antigens have been shown to induce immunity comparable to human rAd5-H5 vaccines [33, 56] . Recombinant, replication-defective adenoviruses from low-prevalence serotypes have also been shown to be efficacious. Low prevalence serotypes such as adenovirus types 3, 7, 11, and 35 can evade anti-Ad5 immune responses while maintaining effective antigen delivery and immunogenicity [48, 57] . Prime-boost strategies, using DNA or protein immunization in conjunction with an adenovirus vaccine booster immunization have also been explored as a means to avoided preexisting immunity [52] . Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) were first explored as gene therapy vectors. Like rAd vectors, rAAV have broad tropism infecting a variety of hosts, tissues, and proliferating and non-proliferating cell types [58] . AAVs had been generally not considered as vaccine vectors because they were widely considered to be poorly immunogenic. A seminal study using AAV-2 to express a HSV-2 glycoprotein showed this virus vaccine vector effectively induced potent CD8 + T cell and serum antibody responses, thereby opening the door to other rAAV vaccine-associated studies [59, 60] . AAV vector systems have a number of engaging properties. The wild type viruses are non-pathogenic and replication incompetent in humans and the recombinant AAV vector systems are even further attenuated [61] . As members of the parvovirus family, AAVs are small non-enveloped viruses that are stable and amenable to long-term storage without a cold chain. While there is limited preexisting immunity, availability of non-human strains as vaccine candidates eliminates these concerns. Modifications to the vector have increased immunogenicity, as well [60] . There are limited studies using AAVs as vaccine vectors for influenza. An AAV expressing an HA antigen was first shown to induce protective in 2001 [62] . Later, a hybrid AAV derived from two non-human primate isolates (AAVrh32.33) was used to express influenza NP and protect against PR8 challenge in mice [63] . Most recently, following the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus pandemic, rAAV vectors were generated expressing the HA, NP and matrix 1 (M1) proteins of A/Mexico/4603/2009 (pH1N1), and in murine immunization and challenge studies, the rAAV-HA and rAAV-NP were shown to be protective; however, mice vaccinated with rAAV-HA + NP + M1 had the most robust protection. Also, mice vaccinated with rAAV-HA + rAAV-NP + rAAV-M1 were also partially protected against heterologous (PR8, H1N1) challenge [63] . Most recently, an AAV vector was used to deliver passive immunity to influenza [64, 65] . In these studies, AAV (AAV8 and AAV9) was used to deliver an antibody transgene encoding a broadly cross-protective anti-influenza monoclonal antibody for in vivo expression. Both intramuscular and intranasal delivery of the AAVs was shown to protect against a number of influenza virus challenges in mice and ferrets, including H1N1 and H5N1 viruses [64, 65] . These studies suggest that rAAV vectors are promising vaccine and immunoprophylaxis vectors. To this point, while approximately 80 phase I, I/II, II, or III rAAV clinical trials are open, completed, or being reviewed, these have focused upon gene transfer studies and so there is as yet limited safety data for use of rAAV as vaccines [66] . Alphaviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of the Togaviridae family. A variety of alphaviruses have been developed as vaccine vectors, including Semliki Forest virus (SFV), Sindbis (SIN) virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus, as well as chimeric viruses incorporating portions of SIN and VEE viruses. The replication defective vaccines or replicons do not encode viral structural proteins, having these portions of the genome replaces with transgenic material. The structural proteins are provided in cell culture production systems. One important feature of the replicon systems is the self-replicating nature of the RNA. Despite the partial viral genome, the RNAs are self-replicating and can express transgenes at very high levels [67] . SIN, SFV, and VEE have all been tested for efficacy as vaccine vectors for influenza virus [68] [69] [70] [71] . A VEE-based replicon system encoding the HA from PR8 was demonstrated to induce potent HA-specific immune response and protected from challenge in a murine model, despite repeated immunization with the vector expressing a control antigen, suggesting preexisting immunity may not be an issue for the replicon vaccine [68] . A separate study developed a VEE replicon system expressing the HA from A/Hong Kong/156/1997 (H5N1) and demonstrated varying efficacy after in ovo vaccination or vaccination of 1-day-old chicks [70] .Question: What can give protection against clinical disease?","answer":"mucosal IgA antibodies also may contribute to resistance against infection"},{"question":"Develop a JavaScript class which accepts two string parameters.

Your code should be able to handle any data size and number of classes.","answer":"Sure, here\'s the generic code implementing multi-class logistic regression using One-vs-Rest technique and includes normalization of data in Scikit-learn that can handle any data size and number of classes:```pythonfrom sklearn import datasetsfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, train_test_splitfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegressionfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_reportfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScalerimport numpy as np# Load iris dataset from sklearn iris = datasets.load_iris()X = iris.datay = iris.target# Split the dataset into training and testing setsX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 42)# Apply standard normalization to optimize the performancescaler = StandardScaler()X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)# Fit multi-class logistic regression model with One-vs-Rest techniquelogreg = LogisticRegression(multi_class=\'ovr\', solver=\'liblinear\')logreg.fit(X_train, y_train)# Make predictions on the testing sety_pred = logreg.predict(X_test)# Evaluate model performanceprint(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))# Validate model performance using 10-Fold Cross-validationscores = cross_val_score(logreg, X_train, y_train, cv=10)print(\\"Cross-validation mean accuracy: \\", np.mean(scores))```Please note that in the `LogisticRegression()` function, the argument `multi_class` needs to be set as `ovr`, which stands for One-vs-Rest. Also, remember to set the `solver` appropriate for your dataset size.Normalization (or standardization) is useful to bring all features in the dataset to the same scale. Features might be of different scales initially, and some algorithms (like Logistic Regression) converge faster when they are on a similar scale.The effect of normalization is data and model dependent; it can significantly improve some models\' performance while having minimal or no impact on others. It tends to have a higher impact when features differ vastly in their scales, as it could cause numerical instability.Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample. It provides a precise estimate of how well the model is likely to perform on unseen data. K-Fold Cross-validation is a popular version of cross-validation where the original sample is randomly partitioned into \'k\' equal sized subsamples. It significantly reduces bias as we are using most of the data for fitting, and also significantly reduces variance as most of the data is also being used in validation set. Interchanging the training and test sets also gives the opportunity to validate the model\'s performance over various scenarios and understand its average performance."},{"question":"Devise an algorithmic procedure that detects the occurrence of a negative whole number within a sequence of numerical entities.numbers = [10, -5, 4, 20]","answer":"Here is a Python function that uses a simple for loop to iterate over the sequence and checks each number. If a negative whole number is detected, it returns True immediately. If no negative number is detected by the end of the sequence, it returns False.```pythondef has_negative(numbers):    for number in numbers:        if number < 0 and number == int(number):            return True    return Falsenumbers = [10, -5, 4, 20]print(has_negative(numbers))  # prints: True```In this script, the function has_negative is defined to take in a list of numbers. Inside the body of the function, we start a for loop to iterate through each number in the list. At each iteration, we perform the check (number < 0) to see if the number is negative and (number == int(number)) to ensure it\'s a whole number. If both these conditions are true, the function immediate returns True to indicate it has found a negative whole number. If the function runs through the entire list without finding a negative whole number, it will return False, indicating no negative whole number was found. For the sequence you have provided [10, -5, 4, 20] the negative whole number present is -5 so the result would be True."},{"question":"Create a Python function that converts decimal numbers to ternary (base 3) representation for a given range, and handles negative input values by returning their absolute ternary representations.","answer":"Here is a Python function using recusion method that solves this task:```pythondef dec_to_ternary(n):    if n < 0:        n = abs(n)  # return the absolute ternary representation for negative values    if n == 0:        return \'0\'    elif n == 1:        return \'1\'    elif n == 2:        return \'2\'    else:        return dec_to_ternary(n // 3) + dec_to_ternary(n % 3)# test the functionfor i in range(-10, 11):    print(f\\"{i}: {dec_to_ternary(i)}\\")```This function takes as input an integer `n` and returns its ternary representation. If `n` is negative, it converts `n` to its absolute value before proceeding with the conversion.The function works by recursively breaking down `n` into smaller parts until it reaches a base case (0, 1 or 2), and then building up the ternary representation from there.To convert a number to ternary, it divides the number by 3 and keeps the remainder. This is repeated with the result of the division until 0 is reached. The ternary representation of the number is then constructed by concatenating all the remainders, starting from the remainder of the last non-zero division.For negative numbers, the function simply calculates the absolute value of the number using the built-in Python function `abs()` and then proceeds as for positive numbers. In other words, negative numbers are treated as if they were positive, thus fulfilling the requirement that negative input values should be returned as their absolute ternary representations."},{"question":"Elucidate the construction of an instruction that engages the inbuilt mechanisms of Node Package Manager with the aim of enabling the retrieval of a particular module, specifically under the framework of Node.js.

A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range. To be more precise in the context of your data - if the computed standard deviation is small, it means that most of your numbers are close to the average (mean) of your data set. In contrast, if the standard deviation is big, this means that your numbers are more spread out and deviate more from the average. Thus, standard deviation can tell us if the data points in our set are generally consistent, or if they widely vary."},{"question":"Help me flip this SVG horizontally.<svg width=\\"32\\"

Using LINQ\'s FirstOrDefault (C# 3.0 and onwards), it will look like this:MyObject match = mObjList.FirstOrDefault(mo => Criteria(mo));FirstOrDefault will return null if no match was found.For C# 2.0, you can take advantage of List\'s built-in Find method which takes a Predicate:MyObject match = mObjList.Find(mo => Criteria(mo));If no match was found, Find will return the default value for the type, which is null for reference types.Again, if you\'re stuck in C# 2.0 and can\'t use lambda expressions, you could use the Predicate delegate:MyObject match = mObjList.Find(delegate(MyObject mo){ return Criteria(mo); });Or you could create a method (C# 2.0):public MyObject Match(MyObject mo){  return Criteria(mo);}And then call this method:MyObject match = mObjList.Find(Match);All the above methods return the first match they find.

The solution should include efficient memory management techniques and consideration of latency issues.","answer":"Performing real-time image processing using OpenCV on the CIFAR-10 dataset in a multithreaded environment is beyond the abilities of a single code segment as it requires vast knowledge in multithreading and real-time processing. However, I can provide the key elements and an example of using multithreading with OpenCV features, while giving some hints on how to do the memory management and latency handling.1. Memory Management for Image Processing: Choose proper data types and consider pre-allocating memory for your variables. In OpenCV, instead of re-declaring image variables, it\'s better to allocate space for it once and re-use it. This saves some time and increases efficiency.2. Latency Issues: Use buffering techniques or asynchronous data loading. In practice, you can load the next data while processing the current data or load data in chunks. This avoids the situation where your algorithm needs to wait for data to load.However, here\'s a quick guide and example of how you could use OpenCV for image processing in a multithreaded environment:1. At the base level, multithreading in Python can be achieved using the `threading` module. In a multithreaded application, each thread will run concurrently with other threads which can significantly speed up processing.2. You can use the `cv2.imshow` function to display images in a window. This function should be in the main thread, as UI updates need to be in the main thread.Here\'s a base sample:```pythonimport cv2import threadingimport queue# This is a Thread-safe queueframe_queue = queue.Queue()def thread_function():  # load the CIFAR10 Dataset  # you would process real-time data here...  (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()  for image in x_train:    # process your image with OpenCV here...    processed_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)    frame_queue.put(processed_image)thread = threading.Thread(target=thread_function)thread.start()while True:  if not frame_queue.empty():    image = frame_queue.get()    cv2.imshow(\'Processed Image\', image)    cv2.waitKey(1)```This is a very simplified example. It creates a separate thread for processing the images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. All the processed images are put into a queue. The main thread checks if the queue has any images and displays them.For a real scenario, it would be good to use a producer-consumer pattern to handle image processing and displaying with proper synchronization. As well, you\'d need to add proper error checking and handling. Remember not to make UI updates or draw using OpenCV in other threads."},{"question":"Determine the specific kind of data repository employed in the ensuing computational procedure.

Substrates that are translocated co-translationally across the membrane are directed to the translocation pore via an interaction between the cytosolic signal recognition particle and its membrane-bound receptor. Together the translocation pore and the receptor are referred to as a translocon. By studying the biogenesis of the translocon a number of alternate targeting and membrane-integration pathways have been discovered that operate independently of the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway. The novel assembly strategies of the translocon and the ways in which these components interact to ensure the fidelity and unidirectionality of the targeting and translocation process are reviewed here.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"aqueous pore\\", \\"translocons\\", \\"cytosolic\\", \\"endoplasmic reticulum\\", \\"membrane\\", \\"translocon\\", \\"translocation pore\\", \\"inner membrane\\"]}"},{"question":"Provide a detailed explanation and procedure for the organization of an arbitrary number of n numerical entities through the application of either the merge or heap sorting algorithms, ensuring that the process is effectively functioning within an O(n log n) computational complexity timeframe.","answer":"Sorting an arbitrary number of n numerical entities is a common problem in computer science and algorithms for it have been extensively studied. Two common algorithms for sorting data in O(n log n) time are the merge sort and heap sort. Here\'s a simple procedure for each:1. Merge sort:Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that follows the approach of breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly.Procedure:- If the list is of length 0 or 1, then it is already sorted.- Otherwise:   * Divide the unsorted list into two sublists of about half the size.   * Sort each sublist recursively by re-applying the merge sort.   * Merge the two sorted sublists back into one sorted list.This approach works because smaller lists are easier to sort. When you merge those sorted lists, you can do so in a way that results in a new sorted list.2. Heap sort:Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on a Binary Heap data structure. It works by visualizing the elements of the array as a special kind of complete binary tree called a \'heap\'.Procedure:- Build a max heap from the input data.- The largest item is stored at the root of the heap. Replace it with the last item of the heap followed by reducing the size of heap by 1. Finally, heapify the root of the tree.- Repeat above steps while size of heap is greater than 1.Both of these algorithms run in O(n log n) time. This is due to the nature of their operations. In merge sort, the list is constantly being split in half and then merged together, resulting in a log2n split operations and n merge operations for a total of n log2n operations. In heap sort, the time complexity of heapify is O(Logn) and we run it n times, resulting in a total of n logn operations.To ensure this operation is performed effectively, it\'s crucial to properly implement the algorithms and understand their underlying logic. Also, keeping concern of space complexity along is advised to ensure the program runs efficiently. Finally, the sort must be implemented in a way that it correctly sorts in all scenarios. This often involves creating a set of test cases that test all possible conditions."},{"question":"I have two different test done in two different facilities.

Chi-square or Fisher\'s exact test: These statistical tests can be used to compare the categorical data, i.e., outcome of the testing (positive or negative) in both facilities.2. McNemar\'s test: This test is specifically designed to compare paired nominal data. It compares the proportion of subjects where the two tests disagree about the outcome.3. Z-test for two proportions: If you have calculated the sensitivity and specificity for each test, you could use the Z-test for two proportions to compare if the sensitivity or specificity of the tests significantly differ from each other.4. DeLong test: This is a method for comparing two correlated ROC areas generated from the same set of subjects. This test can provide a comparison if both facilities have provided measures of test uncertainty (like confidence intervals or standard errors) along with their sensitivity and specificity measures.These techniques can provide a statistical comparison on performance of two tests, however they will not provide information on which test is superior over the other.

Beta-catenin is the vertebrate homolog of the Drosophila segment polarity gene Armadillo and plays roles in both cell-cell adhesion and transduction of the Wnt signaling cascade. Recently, members of the Lef / Tcf transcription factor family have been identified as protein partners of beta-catenin, explaining how beta-catenin alters gene expression. Here we report that in T cells, Tcf-1 also becomes transcriptionally active through interaction with beta-catenin, suggesting that the Wnt signal transduction pathway is operational in T lymphocytes as well. However, although Wnt signals are known to inhibit the activity of the negative regulatory protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), resulting in increased levels of beta-catenin, we find no evidence for involvement of GSK-3beta in Tcf-mediated transcription in T cells. That is, a dominant negative GSK-3beta does not specifically activate Tcf transcription and stimuli (lithium or phytohemagglutinin) that inhibit GSK-3beta activity also do not activate Tcf reporter genes. Thus, inhibition of GSK-3beta is insufficient to activate Tcf-dependent transcription in T lymphocytes. In contrast, in C57MG fibroblast cells, lithium inactivates GSK-3beta and induces Tcf-controlled transcription. This is the first demonstration that lithium can alter gene expression of Tcf-responsive genes, and points to a difference in regulation of Wnt signaling between fibroblasts and lymphocytes.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"C57MG fibroblast cells\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"T lymphocytes\\", \\"fibroblasts\\", \\"lymphocytes\\", \\"T cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"Tcf - responsive genes\\", \\"Armadillo\\", \\"Drosophila segment polarity gene\\", \\"Tcf reporter genes\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"beta - catenin\\", \\"glycogen synthase kinase - 3beta\\", \\"phytohemagglutinin\\", \\"negative regulatory protein kinase\\", \\"Tcf - 1\\", \\"the negative regulatory protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase - 3beta (GSK - 3beta)\\", \\"Lef / Tcf transcription factor family\\", \\"dominant negative GSK - 3beta\\", \\"glycogen synthase kinase - 3\\", \\"GSK - 3beta\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

In this study, we aimed to examine relationships between patients\' preoperative expectations and their demographic and clinical characteristics. We hypothesized that patients with more disability and those with anxiety or depressive symptoms would have greater expectations. All adult patients scheduled for elective foot or ankle surgery by 1 of 6 orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeons were screened for inclusion over 8 months. Preoperatively, all patients completed the Hospital for Special Surgery Foot & Ankle Surgery Expectations Survey in addition to the Foot & Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS), Short Form (SF)-12, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-8, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), and pain visual analog scale (VAS). The expectations survey contained 23 expectations categories, each with 5 answer choices ranging from \\"I do not have this expectation \\" to \\" complete improvement \\" expected. It was scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more expectations. Differences in expectations relating to numerous patient demographic and clinical variables were assessed. In total, 352 patients with an average age of 55 ± 15 (range, 18-86) years were enrolled. Expectations scores were not related to age (P = .36). On average, women expected to achieve complete improvement more often than men (P = .011). Variables that were significantly associated with higher expectations scores (P < .05) included nonwhite race, use of a cane or other assistive device, and greater medical comorbidity. Worse function and quality of life (as assessed by all FAOS subscales and the SF-12 physical and mental components), more depressive and anxiety symptoms, and higher pain VAS scores were associated with higher expectations scores and more expectations (P < .01 for all). The results of this study may help inform surgeons \' preoperative discussions with their patients regarding realistic expectations from surgery. Generally, patients with worse function and more disability had higher expectations from surgery. Addressing these patients\' expectations preoperatively may help improve their ultimate satisfaction with surgery.

Known primarily from bacteria, riboswitches couple specific ligand binding and changes in RNA structure to mRNA expression in cis. Crystal structures of the ligand binding domains of most of the phylogenetically widespread classes of riboswitches, each specific to a particular metabolite or ion, are now available. Thus, the bound states -one end point -have been thoroughly characterized, but the unbound states have been more elusive. Consequently, it is less clear how the unbound, sensing riboswitch refolds into the ligand binding - induced output state. The ligand recognition mechanisms of riboswitches are diverse, but we find that they share a common structural strategy in positioning their binding sites at the point of the RNA three-dimensional fold where the residues farthest from one another in sequence meet. We review how riboswitch folds adhere to this fundamental strategy and propose future research directions for understanding and harnessing their ability to specifically control gene expression.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [\\"bacteria\\"], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"mRNA expression\\", \\"gene expression\\", \\"Gene Expression\\", \\"ligand binding\\", \\"specific ligand binding\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"RNA\\", \\"Riboswitch\\", \\"Crystal structures\\", \\"metabolite\\", \\"riboswitch\\", \\"riboswitches\\", \\"ligand\\", \\"Riboswitches\\", \\"sensing riboswitch\\", \\"ion\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"research\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"folds\\", \\"refolds\\", \\"RNA motifs\\", \\"structure\\", \\"ligand binding domains\\", \\"structural\\", \\"positioning\\", \\"widespread\\", \\"three-dimensional fold\\", \\"directions\\", \\"binding sites\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

In this analogy, epistasis constrains evolution, with some mutations tolerated only after the occurrence of others. To test whether epistasis similarly constrains actual protein evolution, we created all intermediates along a 39-mutation evolutionary trajectory of influenza nucleoprotein, and also introduced each mutation individually into the parent. Several mutations were deleterious to the parent despite becoming fixed during evolution without negative impact. These mutations were destabilizing, and were preceded or accompanied by stabilizing mutations that alleviated their adverse effects. The constrained mutations occurred at sites enriched in T-cell epitopes, suggesting they promote viral immune escape. Our results paint a coherent portrait of epistasis during nucleoprotein evolution, with stabilizing mutations permitting otherwise inaccessible destabilizing mutations which are sometimes of adaptive value.Introduction:Epistasis can play a key role in evolution, such as by constraining accessible evolutionary pathways( Weinreich et al., 2005; Kryazhimskiy et al., 2011) and increasing the role of contingency in adaptation( Blount et al., 2008; Bridgham et al., 2009). One of the simplest types of epistasis is that which occurs between mutations within a single protein. That such epistasis is common has long been considered self-evident–for example, in their seminal 1965 analysis of protein evolution, Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling wrote, “Of course… the functional effect of a given single substitution will frequently depend on the presence or absence of a number of other substitutions( Zuckerkandl and Pauling, 1965). ” But although numerous laboratory evolution and site-directed mutagenesis experiments have demonstrated that mutations can in principle exhibit strong epistatic interactions( Bershtein et al., 2006; Bloom et al., 2006; Lunzer et al., 2010; Salverda et al., 2011), surprisingly little is known about the actual role of epistasis in natural protein evolution. A few studies have reconstructed naturally occurring mutations involved in antibiotic resistance or steroid-receptor ligand specificity( Wang et al., 2002; Weinreich et al., 2006; Ortlund et al., 2007; Bridgham et al., 2009) and found strong epistatic interactions. However, these studies have focused on small numbers of mutations pre-selected for analysis due to their putative adaptive role, and in most cases the actual temporal order of mutations is unknown. As a result, many basic questions remain without clear answers: What is the prevalence of epistasis during protein evolution? How does epistasis arise from an evolutionary process that is conceived as proceeding through the incremental accumulation of mutations? And is it possible to coherently understand epistasis in terms of the underlying protein biophysics? An experimental approach to address these questions is suggested by John Maynard Smith’s classic analogy between protein evolution and the game where the goal is to convert one word into another a single letter at a time passing only through intermediates that are also words( Maynard Smith, 1970):WORD→WORE→GORE→GONE→GENE. Implicit in this analogy is the idea that epistasis constrains evolution—for example, the original parent sequence does not tolerate three of the four eventual changes, as GORD, WERD and WOND are not words. We sought to similarly test for epistasis in actual protein evolution by reconstructing an extended natural evolutionary trajectory, and then also introducing each mutation individually into the original parent( Figure 1). While this experimental strategy is not guaranteed to find every possible epistatic interaction, it will systematically identify all mutations that have different effects in the original parent and the evolutionary intermediates in which they actually occurred. The experimental strategy in Figure 1 also offers the possibility of determining how epistatically interacting mutations were actually fixed—for example through sequential functional intermediates as posited by Maynard Smith, or by the simultaneous or closely coupled fixation of several individually deleterious mutations( Kimura, 1985; Meer et al., 2010). 10. 7554/eLife. 00631. 003Figure 1. Outline of experiment designed to parallel Maynard Smith’s analogy. The actual evolutionary trajectory involves the accumulation of mutations, and consists of a series of evolutionary intermediates. We recreate and experimentally assay each of these evolutionary intermediates. We also introduce each mutation individually into the original parent sequence, and experimentally assay these single mutants. If Maynard Smith is correct, each of the naturally occurring evolutionary intermediates should be a functional protein. However, some of the single mutants could exhibit impaired function if there is significant epistasis among mutations along the evolutionary trajectory. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 00631. 003 The experiment outlined in Figure 1 requires a protein for which it is possible both to reconstruct the natural evolution and to assay for the functions that contribute to biological fitness. Human H3N2 influenza A virus is exceptionally suited to the first requirement, as the extensive availability of contemporary and historical sequences enables the detailed reconstruction of evolutionary trajectories. We focused on the 498-residue nucleoprotein( NP). Although NP’s evolution is less rapid and medically infamous than that of its surface counterparts hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, NP still accumulates roughly one amino-acid substitution per year( Rambaut et al., 2008). Crucially for our experiment, NP’s primary function—serving as a scaffold for viral RNA during transcription and genome packaging( Portela and Digard, 2002; Ye et al., 2006)—occurs within the interior of infected cells, and so is probably fairly authentically represented in tissue-culture assays. NP is also a target of cytotoxic T lymphocytes( CTLs), and so is under continual pressure for change in CTL epitopes( Berkhoff et al., 2004, 2007; Valkenburg et al., 2011)—a pressure partially countered by the fact that some of these epitopes are under functional constraint( Rimmelzwaan, et al., 2004a; Berkhoff et al., 2005, 2006). CTL selection in influenza is thought to be weaker than antibody selection on the viral surface proteins, and so much of NP’s evolution is shaped by stochastic forces such as population bottlenecks and hitchhiking with antigenic mutations in the surface proteins( Rambaut et al., 2008; Bhatt et al., 2011)—stochastic forces that in some cases can also accelerate the fixation CTL escape mutations( Gog et al., 2003). Our experiments do not measure these complexities of immune pressure as they do not include CTL selection, but as described later in this paper, existing data enable us to identify adaptive CTL-escape mutations. In the work reported here, we use the strategy in Figure 1 to synthesize information about influenza’s natural evolution with our own experiments to examine epistasis in NP evolution. We find that epistasis constrains both the sequence evolution and ongoing adaptation of NP, and that the mechanistic basis for most of this epistasis can be understood in remarkably simple terms.Discussion:Our results paint a remarkably coherent picture of epistasis in NP evolution. We identified three mutations that are strongly deleterious to the original parent, yet were eventually fixed without adverse effect. All three mutations decrease NP’s thermal stability. This decreased stability reduces in vivo protein levels, in turn reducing total transcriptional activity and viral growth. On the other hand, stabilizing mutations have little effect on protein levels, activity, or growth in the background of the parent NP—presumably because this parent is already sufficiently stable for its cellular environment. However, these stabilizing mutations play a crucial evolutionary role by counteracting the destabilizing mutations and enabling them to fix during evolution. Of course, we do not wish to caricature protein evolution by suggesting that all epistasis is mediated by stability. In principle, mutations can affect a multitude of properties of NP, including its homo-oligomerization, association with RNA and other proteins, and cellular transport. We do not suggest that these properties are unimportant. In fact, we observe an epistatic interaction between R384G and E375G that likely relates to the electrostatic charge on one of NP’s surfaces. Our assays are also of finite sensitivity, and so may miss small effects that are still significant to natural selection. There is also the potential for epistasis between NP and other viral proteins, although we see no evidence for such epistasis here, since all NP evolutionary intermediates that we tested are functional in a fixed background of other proteins. But doubtless some of these other mechanisms of epistasis would become apparent if we examined even longer evolutionary trajectories. However, the overriding message from our experiments is that stability-mediated epistasis is the dominant constraint on NP evolution. Epistatically interacting mutations can be fixed in several ways. The mutations can accumulate sequentially without ever passing through a low-fitness intermediate( as in Maynard Smith’s analogy), an initial deleterious mutation can be compensated by a subsequent mutation, or multiple mutations can occur simultaneously. We have identified two instances that clearly conform to Maynard Smith’s paradigm: the stabilizing M136I preceded V280A, and the stabilizing S259L preceded R384G( Figure 4B, C). We also identified two instances where the actual evolutionary path is unclear due to a lack of natural sequence data from the relevant timeframe: N334H/L259S, and E375G/R384G( Figure 4A, B). However, in both cases it is at least possible that evolution conformed to Maynard Smith’s paradigm: no simultaneous mutations or deleterious intermediates need have occurred if N334H preceded L259S, and if E375G preceded R384G( Figure 4A, B). Previous experimental studies have identified stabilizing mutations as contributing to the evolution of enzyme specificities( Bloom et al., 2006), bacterial( Wang et al., 2002; Bershtein et al., 2006; Weinreich et al., 2006) and viral( Chang and Torbett, 2011) drug resistance, and H5N1 transmissibility( Imai et al., 2012). At a broader level, analyses of large datasets have shown that it is common for mutations to be deleterious to one protein homolog but benign to another( Kondrashov et al., 2002; Baresic et al., 2010). Our work illustrates how the dynamics of stability during evolution might explain these findings. As shown in Figure 7C, most of the intermediates during NP’s evolution are only marginally more stable than the minimal threshold where function begins to suffer. This marginal stability of natural proteins has been noted previously, and been given two distinct explanations. The first explanation holds that evolution actively selects for marginal stability because both insufficient and excess stability are deleterious( DePristo et al., 2005; Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009). The second explanation holds that evolution only selects against insufficient stability, but that proteins typically are marginally stable because most mutations are destabilizing and so extra stability is rapidly eroded by functionally neutral but destabilizing mutations( Taverna and Goldstein, 2002; Bloom et al., 2007). Our results decisively favor the second explanation for NP, since the evolving protein is usually marginally stable despite the fact that higher stability has no deleterious effect( Figure 7A, B). We therefore suggest the following: functionally neutral but stabilizing mutations occasionally fix by stochastic forces such as genetic drift, population bottlenecks, or hitchhiking. These stabilizing mutations enable NP to tolerate otherwise deleterious destabilizing mutations. Although these destabilizing mutations could in principle also fix by stochastic forces, the three that we have identified are actually adaptive since they contribute to viral immune escape. Stability-mediated epistasis therefore constrains NP’s adaptation as well as its sequence evolution, since the accessibility of immune-escape mutations is dependent on the acquisition of enabling mutations. It is intriguing to speculate whether similar forms of epistasis might constrain the evolution of other proteins. For example, the antigenic evolution of influenza hemagglutinin is punctuated, with a fairly constant rate of sequence change nonetheless leading to periodic jumps in antigenicity that require reformulation of the annual influenza vaccine( Smith et al., 2004). One explanation that has been posited for this punctuated pattern is that adaptive antigenic change is limited not by the overall rate of substitution, but rather by the waiting time for the protein to accumulate antigenically neutral mutations that can be productively combined with mutations causing large antigenic changes( Koelle et al., 2006; van Nimwegen, 2006). Stability-mediated epistasis of the type that we have observed for NP provides at least one plausible mechanistic explanation for this and other cases of constrained molecular evolution.","answer":"During evolution , the effect of one mutation on a protein can depend on whether another mutation is also present . This phenomenon is similar to the game in which one word is converted to another word , one letter at a time , subject to the rule that all the intermediate steps are also valid words: for example , the word WORD can be converted to the word GENE as follows: WORD→WORE→GORE→GONE→GENE . In this example , the D must be changed to an E before the W is changed to a G , because GORD is not a valid word . Similarly , during the evolution of a virus , a mutation that helps the virus evade the human immune system might only be tolerated if the virus has acquired another mutation beforehand . This type of mutational interaction would constrain the evolution of the virus , since its capacity to take advantage of the second mutation depends on the first mutation having already occurred . Gong et al . examined whether such interactions have indeed constrained evolution of the influenza virus . Between 1968 and 2007 , the nucleoprotein—which acts as a scaffold for the replication of genetic material—in the human H3N2 influenza virus underwent a series of 39 mutations . To test whether all of these mutations could have been tolerated by the 1968 virus , Gong et al . introduced each one individually into the 1968 nucleoprotein . They found that several mutations greatly reduced the fitness of the 1968 virus when introduced on their own , which strongly suggests that these ‘constrained mutations’ became part of the virus’s genetic makeup as a result of interactions with ‘enabling’ mutations . The constrained mutations decreased the stability of the nucleoprotein at high temperatures , while the enabling mutations counteracted this effect . It may , therefore , be possible to identify enabling mutations based on their effects on thermal stability . Intriguingly , the constrained mutations helped the virus overcome one form of human immunity to influenza , suggesting that interactions between mutations might limit the rate at which viruses evolve to evade the immune system . Overall , these results show that interactions among mutations constrain the evolution of the influenza nucleoprotein in a fashion that can be largely understood in terms of protein stability . If the same is true for other proteins and viruses , this work could lead to a deeper understanding of the constraints that govern evolution at the molecular level ."},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

Multicentre randomised controlled trial.                Eleven centres in the north of France and one in Belgium.                One thousand and eight hundred and fifty-three nulliparous women recruited between 14 and 20 weeks of gestation.                Randomisation either to undergo a uterine Doppler examination between 22 and 24 week of gestation or to take a placebo. Women with abnormal Doppler waveforms received 100 mg of aspirin daily from Doppler examination through 36 weeks.                Pre-eclampsia was defined as hypertension (> or = 140 and/or 90 mmHg) associated with proteinuria (> or = 0.5 g/L).                One thousand two hundred and fifty-three women (67%) were randomised into the systematic Doppler group and 617 (33%) into the placebo group. Of the 1175 patients in the Doppler group who underwent this examination, 239 (20.3%) had abnormal uterine artery Doppler and received a prescription for aspirin. Despite the aspirin prescription, the frequency of pre-eclampsia did not differ between the systematic Doppler group and the placebo group (28 of 1237 [2.3%] vs 9 of 616 [1.5%]; RR = 1.55, 95% CI 0.7-3.3). Furthermore, the groups did not differ in the frequency of children who were very small for their gestational age (< or =3rd centile) or for perinatal deaths. Compared with patients with normal Doppler findings, those with abnormal Doppler were at high risk of pre-eclampsia (RR = 5.5, 95% CI 2.5-12.2) and of giving birth to a small-for-gestational-age child (RR = 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-8.1).                Despite its sensitivity in screening for pre-eclampsia, routine uterine Doppler in the second trimester cannot be recommended for nulliparous patients.Title 2:Screening with a uterine Doppler in low risk pregnant women followed by low dose aspirin in women with abnormal results: a multicenter randomised controlled trial.Abstract 2:To assess whether systematic screening with an uterine artery Doppler in low risk pregnant women followed by the prescription of low dose aspirin in cases with abnormal results reduced the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction and pre-eclampsia.                A multicentre randomised trial.                3,317 low risk pregnant women. In the Doppler group, the uterine artery Doppler was performed between 20 and 24 weeks. Women with abnormal results received 100 mg of aspirin daily until the 35th week.                Intrauterine growth restriction was defined as birthweight below the tenth and the third centile according to gestational age. Pre-eclampsia was defined as hypertension associated with proteinuria > 0.5g/L.                Intrauterine growth restriction, whether defined by the third or tenth centile, did not differ significantly between the two groups (RR = 1.22 [0.73 - 2.04] and 1.18 [0.93 - 1.51] respectively). Screening with uterine artery Doppler did not affect birthweight or any of the criteria of perinatal morbidity. There was no effect on the incidence of pre-eclampsia (RR = 1.99 [0.97 - 4.09]) or hypertensive disorders. These results were the same for nulliparae and multiparae.                There is no justification for screening with uterine artery Doppler in a low risk population, even if abnormal results are followed by aspirin treatment and increased prenatal surveillance. Future studies must assess predictive tests that can be performed early in pregnancy and can identify populations at very high risk of pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Only when all of these conditions are fulfilled, aspirin or other treatments may prove its efficacy.","answer":"Present evidence failed to show any benefit to either the baby or the mother when utero-placental Doppler ultrasound was used in the second trimester of pregnancy in women at low risk for hypertensive disorders.

The relative resistance of malignant glioma to chemotherapy makes the identification of new cytotoxic drugs critically important. The use of short-term cultures derived from these tumors to screen drugs at doses that can be attained within human intracranial tumors provides a model system that should be capable of identifying effective drugs suitable for clinical evaluation. The sensitivity of a panel of short-term cultures derived from 22 malignant astrocytoma and four malignant oligodendroglioma was assessed to aziridinylbenzoquinone ( AZQ ) , etoposide and doxorubicin ( DOX ) using a [ (35)S ] methione uptake assay . The ID(50) of each culture was compared to the levels of drug which could be achieved in the tumor using standard doses. There was marked heterogeneity between cultures in response to each drug. Whilst there was no evidence that cultures derived from grade III astrocytoma were more sensitive to any of the drugs than cultures derived from grade IV astrocytoma, cultures derived from oligodendroglioma tended to be more sensitive to the alkylating agent AZQ, but not to either of the other drugs. The sensitivity of these short-term cultures at concentrations that can be achieved in situ corresponded well with the clinical efficacy of AZQ and etoposide. Although DOX appeared to be toxic to human gliomas cells in vitro, its limited penetration into the intact brain would seem to preclude its use i.v., but it is likely to be effective if local drug delivery techniques could be employed.

Overt inflammatory bowel disease( IBD) occurs in about 10% of AS patients, and in addition 70% of AS cases may have subclinical terminal ileitis. Spondyloarthritis is also common in IBD patients. We therefore tested Crohn\'s disease susceptibility genes for association with AS, aiming to identify pleiotropic genetic associations with both diseases. Genotyping was carried out using Sequenom and Applied Biosystems TaqMan and OpenArray technologies on 53 markers selected from 30 Crohn\'s disease associated genomic regions. We tested genotypes in a population of unrelated individual cases( n = 2, 773) and controls( n = 2, 215) of white European ancestry for association with AS. Statistical analysis was carried out using a Cochran-Armitage test for trend in PLINK. Strong association was detected at chr1q32 near KIF21B( rs11584383, P = 1. 6×10−10, odds ratio( OR) = 0. 74, 95% CI:0. 68–0. 82). Association with disease was also detected for 2 variants within STAT3( rs6503695, P = 4. 6×10−4. OR = 0. 86( 95% CI:0. 79–0. 93); rs744166, P = 2. 6×10−5, OR = 0. 84( 95% CI:0. 77–0. 91)). Association was confirmed for IL23R( rs11465804, P = 1. 2×10−5, OR = 0. 65( 95% CI:0. 54–0. 79)), and further associations were detected for IL12B( rs10045431, P = 5. 2×10−5, OR = 0. 83( 95% CI:0. 76–0. 91)), CDKAL1( rs6908425, P = 1. 1×10−4, OR = 0. 82( 95% CI:0. 74–0. 91)), LRRK2/MUC19( rs11175593, P = 9. 9×10−5, OR = 1. 92( 95% CI: 1. 38–2. 67)), and chr13q14( rs3764147, P = 5. 9×10−4, OR = 1. 19( 95% CI: 1. 08–1. 31)). Excluding cases with clinical IBD did not significantly affect these findings. This study identifies chr1q32 and STAT3 as ankylosing spondylitis susceptibility loci. It also further confirms association for IL23R and detects suggestive association with another 4 loci. STAT3 is a key signaling molecule within the Th17 lymphocyte differentiation pathway and further enhances the case for a major role of this T-lymphocyte subset in ankylosing spondylitis. Finally these findings suggest common aetiopathogenic pathways for AS and Crohn\'s disease and further highlight the involvement of common risk variants across multiple diseases.Introduction:Ankylosing spondylitis( AS) is one of a group of common inflammatory rheumatic diseases known as spondyloarthritidies in which involvement of the spine and sacroiliac joints is prominent[1]. Heritability of the disease assessed by twin studies has been determined to be >90%[2]. Apart from the well known HLA-B27 association, recent genetic studies have identified ERAP1, IL23R and 2 intergenic regions at chr2p15 and chr21q22 as genes/loci associated with AS[3],[4]. However, these alleles only explain a fraction of the overall genetic risk for AS, and other loci are also expected to contribute to susceptibility. There is increasing interest in the genetics community in the study of genetic findings from related diseases to identify pleiotropic genes, as an efficient method to identify further disease-associated variants. Findings from genome-wide association( GWA) studies have identified susceptibility genes common to different diseases, particularly in autoimmune conditions[5]. For example, variants in PTPN22 are associated with rheumatoid arthritis( RA), type-1-diabetes( T1D) and Crohn\'s disease( CD). Thus far, only the gene IL23R( associated with AS) has also been found to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease( IBD) and psoriasis, although the three conditions commonly occur in the same patients, and are co-familial. About 10% of AS patients have overt IBD, and in addition about 70% of AS cases have subclinical terminal ileitis[6]. Gut inflammation is frequent in patients with spondylarthritis, and one-quarter of patients who have chronic spondyloarthritis have some features of CD[7]. Spondyloarthritis is also common in IBD patients. Axial and peripheral arthritis can occur in up to 30% of patients with IBD[8]. The prevalence of axial involvement in IBD is 10–20% for sacroiliitis and 3–12% for spondylitis[9], while radiographic evidence of sacroiliitis is reported in 10–51% of patients with IBD[10]. A study of families of AS probands( n = 205) and of healthy controls( n = 1, 352) in the Icelandic population demonstrated evidence to support a common genetic component for AS and IBD[11]. In addition to confirming the known familiality of both conditions, the study demonstrated a risk ratio of 3. 0 and 2. 1 in 1st and 2nd-degree relatives respectively, for the occurrence of AS in families of probands with IBD, and with the occurrence of IBD in families of patients with AS. It therefore seems likely that common pathogenic pathways may act in the development of both diseases and may be major players in chronic inflammatory disorders. We therefore sought to investigate CD risk variants for association with AS in order to explain the co-occurrence of both conditions.Discussion:The study presented here has identified new loci associated with AS. The strongest of these associations was within an intergenic region at chr1q32, near the gene KIF21B. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to a family of kinesin motor proteins. Kinesins are used for the transport of essential components along axonal and dendritic microtubules by neurons. KIF5A has been associated with rheumatoid arthritis, type-1-diabetes, and is close to a locus recently reported to be associated with multiple sclerosis[16]. It is possible that KIF5A is not the key associated gene at this chromosome 12q13-14 locus. However, if confirmed as the true disease-susceptibility gene for these autoimmune diseases, this would strongly suggest alternate functions for the kinesin protein family. The STAT3 association is particularly significant because of its role, along with IL23R, in the Th17 pathway. In response to cytokine signaling through the IL-23R, STAT3 is activated by phosphorylation and is translocated to the nucleus where it acts as a transcriptional activator. Loss of function mutations of STAT3 result in Job\'s syndrome, in which an absence of Th17 lymphocytes leads to recurrent severe infections, particularly with extracellular bacteria[17]. The association with IL12B is of particular interest given the associations of IL23R and STAT3 with AS. This gene has also been shown to be associated with psoriasis in Caucasian and Chinese populations[18],[19]. IL12B encodes the p40 subunit common to both IL-12 and IL-23 and again highlights the involvement of Th17 cells in disease development. Another marker( rs1433048) within the gene was also nominally associated( P<0. 05) in the combined analysis of the study. It is not clear at the LRRK2/MUC19 locus which is the key associated gene with Crohn\'s disease, although a recent study suggests that LRRK2 is the more likely to be truly disease-associated[20]. LRRK2, a member of the leucine-rich repeat kinase family, is thought to be involved in the process of autophagy. MUC19 encodes a mucin involved in epithelial lining protection; altered intestinal permeability has long been thought to be important in the pathogenesis of AS. This study also provides further evidence of pleiotropic effects in human disease pathology. A notable example of this is the association of PTPN22 with several autoimmune conditions including RA, T1D, CD and SLE. One of the 1st AS risk loci identified, IL23R, is also associated with both forms of IBD( ulcerative colitis and Crohn\'s disease) as well as psoriasis. In this study we provide further evidence for previously and newly identified pleiotropic genes in autoimmune diseases. Given the delicate nature of the immune system and the tight control of the different cell populations it is not surprising that risk alleles of important immune response genes may be associated across a number of different conditions. These findings support the use of study designs focusing on genes previously identified as being associated with related conditions as being an efficient method for identifying further genetic disease-associations. This study of genes associated with Crohn\'s disease has identified definite genome-wide significant association with AS of SNPs at chromosome 1q32 near KIF21B, and experiment-wise association at five other novel-AS loci including STAT3, IL12B, CDKAL1, LRRK2/MUC19, and at chr13q14. This confirms that genes play an important part in the co-familiality of Crohn\'s disease and AS, and highlights the value of studies of potentially pleiotropic genes in related diseases.","answer":"Ankylosing spondylitis is a common inflammatory arthritis primarily affecting the spine and pelvis .

It appears to be because I\'m using \'this\' as an argument in the setTopWorldAgent method. By removing this method call everything appears fine. Why does this happen? Has anyone else experienced this?","answer":"The `null pointer exception` you are facing might not be due to passing `this` as a parameter in the method call itself. `this` keyword inside the constructor refers to the current instance of the object being constructed, so unless your class is abstract you aren\'t going to get a null pointer exception by merely passing `this` to a method. A `null pointer exception` is raised when you try to manipulate a reference that is `null.` The real issue causing null pointer exception lies in what happens inside `setTopWorldAgent()` method. You might be trying to call a method or access a field on a null object inside that method.The key lies in debugging, add null checks, or prints inside your `setTopWorldAgent` method to see which value is null or alternatively use a debugger tool to step through your code and find out where the null value comes from.Here\'s an example of what could be happening:```javapublic void setTopWorldAgent(Agent agent, String str, boolean b) {    // Here, if the \\"someObject\\" is null, calling any method on it will raise a null pointer exception    someObject.doSomething();}``` This is why, even though you are passing `this` (which can\'t be null), you are getting a NullPointerException.

However, somatosensory inputs are challenging to control in awake mammals due to the diversity and nature of contact stimuli. Application of cutaneous stimuli is currently limited to relatively imprecise methods as well as subjective behavioral measures. The strategy we present here overcomes these difficulties, achieving ‘remote touch’ with spatiotemporally precise and dynamic optogenetic stimulation by projecting light to a small defined area of skin. We mapped behavioral responses in freely behaving mice with specific nociceptor and low-threshold mechanoreceptor inputs. In nociceptors, sparse recruitment of single-action potentials shapes rapid protective pain-related behaviors, including coordinated head orientation and body repositioning that depend on the initial body pose. In contrast, activation of low-threshold mechanoreceptors elicited slow-onset behaviors and more subtle whole-body behaviors. The strategy can be used to define specific behavioral repertoires, examine the timing and nature of reflexes, and dissect sensory, motor, cognitive, and motivational processes guiding behavior.Introduction:The survival of an organism depends on its ability to detect and respond appropriately to its environment. Afferent neurons innervating the skin provide sensory information to guide and refine behavior( Seymour, 2019; Zimmerman et al., 2014). Cutaneous stimuli are used to study a wide range of neurobiological mechanisms since neurons densely innervating skin function to provide diverse information as the body interfaces with its immediate environment. These afferents maintain the integrity of the body by recruiting rapid sensorimotor responses, optimize movement through feedback loops, provide teaching signals that drive learning, and update internal models of the environment through higher-order perceptual and cognitive processes( Barik et al., 2018; Brecht, 2017; Corder et al., 2019; de Haan and Dijkerman, 2020; Haggard et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2019; Petersen, 2019; Seymour, 2019). Damaging stimuli, for example, evoke rapid motor responses to minimize immediate harm and generate pain that motivates longer-term behavioral changes. Compared to visual, olfactory, and auditory stimuli, somatosensory inputs are challenging to deliver in awake unrestrained mammals. This is due to the nature of stimuli that require contact and the diversity of stimulus features encoded by afferents that innervate skin. Cutaneous afferent neurons are functionally and genetically heterogeneous, displaying differential tuning, spike thresholds, adaptation rates, and conduction velocities( Abraira and Ginty, 2013; Dubin and Patapoutian, 2010; Gatto et al., 2019; Häring et al., 2018). The arborization of their peripheral terminals can delineate spatial and temporal dimensions of the stimulus( Pruszynski and Johansson, 2014), particularly once many inputs are integrated by the central nervous system( Prescott et al., 2014). Cutaneous stimulation in freely moving mice often requires the experimenter to manually touch or approach the skin. This results in inaccurate timing, duration, and localization of stimuli. The close proximity of the experimenter can cause observer-induced changes in animal behavior( Sorge et al., 2014). Stimuli also activate a mixture of sensory neuron populations. For example, intense stimuli can co-activate fast-conducting low-threshold afferents that encode innocuous stimuli simultaneously with more slowly conducting high-threshold afferents( Wang et al., 2018). The latter are nociceptors that trigger fast protective behaviors and pain. Consequently, mixed cutaneous inputs recruit cells, circuits, and behaviors that are not specific to the neural mechanism under study. A way to control genetically defined afferent populations is to introduce opsins into these afferents and optogenetically stimulate them through the skin( Abdo et al., 2019; Arcourt et al., 2017; Barik et al., 2018; Beaudry et al., 2017; Browne et al., 2017; Daou et al., 2013; Iyer et al., 2014). However, these methods in their current form do not fully exploit the properties of light. The behaviors that are evoked by cutaneous stimuli are also typically measured with limited and often subjective means. Manual scoring introduces unnecessary experimenter bias and omits key features of behavior. Behavioral assays have traditionally focused on a snapshot of the stimulated body part rather than dynamics of behavior involving the body as a whole( Gatto et al., 2019). Recent advances in machine vision and markerless pose estimation have enabled the dissection of animal behavioral sequences( Mathis et al., 2018; Pereira et al., 2019; Wiltschko et al., 2015). However, these have not been adapted to study behavioral outputs relating to specific cutaneous inputs. Here we developed an approach to project precise optogenetic stimuli onto the skin of freely behaving mice( Figure 1A). The strategy elicits time-locked individual action potentials in genetically targeted afferents innervating a small stimulation field targeted to the skin. Stimuli can be delivered remotely as predefined microscale patterns, lines, or moving points. The utility of the system was demonstrated by precisely stimulating nociceptors, or Aβ low threshold mechanoreceptors( LTMRs), in freely behaving mice to map behavioral outputs at high speed. We provide an analysis toolkit that quantifies the millisecond-timescale dynamics of behavioral responses using machine vision methods. We dissect discrete behavioral components of local paw responses, head orienting and body repositioning behaviors, and determine how these specific behavioral components relate to precise somatosensory inputs.Discussion:We describe a strategy for remote, precise, dynamic somatosensory input and behavioral mapping in awake unrestrained mice. The approach can remotely deliver spatiotemporally accurate optogenetic stimuli to the skin with predefined size, geometry, duration, timing, and location, while simultaneously monitoring behavior in the millisecond timescale. Microscale optogenetic stimulation can be used to simulate patterns, edges, and moving points on the skin. Responses to these precisely defined points and patterns can be mapped using machine vision approaches. The design is modular, for example, additional lasers for multicolor optogenetic control or naturalistic infrared stimuli can be added and complementary machine vision analysis approaches readily implemented. As an example, we combine this with DeepLabCut( Mathis et al., 2018), for markerless tracking of individual body parts to further dissect specific components of whole-body responses. We validated the system in two transgenic mouse lines, providing optical control of broad-class Aδ and C-nociceptors, and Aβ-LTMRs. Advances in transcriptional profiling have identified a vast array of genetically defined primary afferent neuron populations involved in specific aspects of temperature, mechanical, and itch sensation( Usoskin et al., 2015). Selective activation of these populations is expected to recruit a specific combination of downstream cells and circuits depending on their function. For example, nociceptive input generates immediate sensorimotor responses and also pain that acts as a teaching signal. This strategy can be thus combined with techniques to modify genes, manipulate cells and neural circuits, and record neural activity in freely behaving mice to probe these mechanisms( Boyden et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2017). We provide approaches to map behavioral responses to defined afferent inputs across the spectrum of somatosensory modalities( Browne et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019). We find that the probabilistic recruitment of nociceptors determines the behavioral response probability, latency, and magnitude. We propose that the aggregate number of first action potentials arriving from nociceptors to the spinal cord can be utilized to optimize the timing and extent of rapid protective responses. These first action potentials could be summated by spinal neurons so that appropriate behaviors are selected based on thresholds. Resultant fast behaviors are diverse but include coordinated head orientation and body repositioning that depends on the initial pose. In contrast, responses to optogenetic activation of Aβ-LTMRs occurred with slower onset, lower probability, and resulted in more subtle whole-body movements. Using a fixed number of pulses, we find that responses from multiple Aβ-LTMR inputs can be explained by the sum rule of probabilities rather than frequency-dependence( Chamessian et al., 2019). This does not, however, rule out the tuning of responses to more spatially or temporally complex stimuli. We used broad-class Cre driver lines to selectively stimulate either nociceptors or Aβ-LTMRs, and it is possible that their respective subpopulations exploit a diversity of coding strategies. This optical approach can reveal how such subpopulation and their specific downstream circuits guide behavior. In summary, we have developed a strategy to precisely control afferents in the skin without touching or approaching them by projecting light to optogenetically generate somatosensory input in patterns, lines, or points. This is carried out non-invasively in awake freely behaving mice in a way that is remote yet precise. Remote control of temporally and spatially precise input addresses the many limitations of manually applied contact stimuli. The timing, extent, directionality, and coordination of resultant millisecond-timescale behavioral responses can be investigated computationally with specific sensory inputs. This provides a way to map behavioral responses, circuits, and cells recruited by defined afferent inputs and dissect the neural basis of processes associated with pain and touch. This strategy thus enables the investigation of sensorimotor, perceptual, cognitive, and motivational processes that guide and shape behavior in health and disease.","answer":"To safely navigate their world , animals need to be able to tell apart a gentle touch from an eye-watering pinch , detect cold water or sense the throbbing pain stemming from an infected cut .

One event can also recruit many different types of endings: a cut for example , will involve responses to mechanical pressure , tissue damage and local immune response . To disentangle these different actors and how they affect behavior , scientists need to develop approaches that allow them to deliver specific stimuli with increased precision , and to monitor the impact on an animal . To achieve this goal , Schorscher-Petcu et al . used mice in which blue light could trigger specific types of nerve endings . For instance , depending on the genetic background of the animals , a laser could either activate nerve endings involved in pain or gentle touch . Crucially , this could be done from a distance by beaming light with exquisite precision onto the paws of the mice without physically touching or disturbing the animals . How the mice responded could then be observed without any interference . Their behavior was analyzed using a combination of high-speed videos , computer-driven recording systems , and machine learning . This revealed subtle changes in behavior that had not been detected before , spotting microscopic movements of the stimulated paw and mapping simultaneous whole-body movements such as changes in posture or head orientation . The approach therefore allows scientists to assess the impact of touch , pain or temperature sensation in freely behaving mice . It could also be harnessed to develop much needed treatments against chronic pain ."},{"question":"Design a software routine that accepts multiple numerical arrays as input, and calculates the maximum disparities between the minimum and maximum values in each respective array.

After the usual configure, make, make install dance I had a build of apache without mod_rewrite. This wasn\'t statically linked and the module was not built in the /modules folder either.I had to do the following to build Apache and mod_rewrite:./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache2 --enable-rewrite=shared- - (The last time I built Apache (2.2.8) on Solaris, by default it built everything as a shared module.)","answer":"This issue arises because the Apache build process does not enable all modules by default. The `--enable-rewrite=shared` flag specifically instructs the build process to include mod_rewrite as a shared module.Mod_rewrite is a very common module for rewrite rules in the htaccess file. It is usually needed for user-friendly URLs and redirections. So, it\'s surprising that it was not included by default in your build.To include more modules, you would use the `--enable-MODULE=shared` flag, replacing \\"MODULE\\" with the name of the module you want to include, like `--enable-deflate=shared` to include mod_deflate.In summary, when building Apache from source, it\'s crucial to specify what modules you want to include in the build process.For those who come across this issue in the future, an Apache built with shared modules allows more flexibility as modules can be loaded or unloaded at runtime without recompiling Apache. Other considerations, like performance impacts or specific application requirements, might determine if modules are compiled statically or dynamically.

Additionally, implement backpropagation from scratch to optimize the neural network. The model should also be capable of handling negation and intensifiers (such as \\"not good\\" translating to negative sentiment or \\"very good\\" translating to intensified positive sentiment). Validate the model using the Precision, Recall and F1-score metrics, and demonstrate how changes in network architecture (e.g., number of hidden units, layers) and training parameters (e.g., learning rate, number of epochs) impact performance.","answer":"The task you asked for is quite complex and cannot be fully implemented in this text format, as it involves multiple lines of code, testing, and debugging. However, here\'s a general step-by-step blueprint on how you might approach such a task.Let\'s break the task down into smaller steps:1. Acquire a labeled dataset for sentiment analysis: You\'ll require a large number of sentences annotated as positive, negative, or neutral to train your model. Datasets like the IMDb movie reviews dataset, the Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset, or the Stanford Sentiment Treebank could be useful.2. Text preprocessing: Clean the text by removing unnecessary symbols, lowercasing letters, stemming, lemmatization and then tokenizing words. Then, encode these words using techniques like Bag of Words or TF-IDF.3. Define the recursive neural network (RvNN): The architecture of the RvNN is critical. As such architecture depends on the specific task, it\'s not possible to suggest a one-fits-all architecture. An example of an RvNN could be an architecture using a variation of an LSTM or GRU cell, due to their good performance on sequential data like text.4. Manage negation and intensifiers: This is the complex part of the problem. One could manage negations and intensifiers by preprocessing the sentences and applying semantic rules, but this would yield a rule-based system rather than an intelligent classifier. A state-of-the-art solution would be to increase the dataset with more examples containing negations and intensifiers, or using word embeddings which hold information about the semantic and functional use of words.5. Implement backpropagation: Backpropagation is the primary algorithm for performing gradient descent on neural networks. The algorithm calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network for a single input-output example, and does so efficiently, unlike a naive direct computation.6. Training the model: Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. Train the model using your training set, while using the validation set to tune any hyperparameters.7. Tune the model for better performance: This involves adjusting several factors, including the number of hidden units and layers, the learning rate, the number of epochs, and potentially the architecture itself.8. Calculate performance metrics: After training, test the model on your testing set and calculate the Precision, Recall, and F1-score.Remember, this is a quite complex task and requires a strong understanding of both neural networks and natural language processing. Python would be a good programming language to use for this project, as it provides several libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch and Keras for machine learning, and NLTK and SpaCy for natural language processing. Libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn can be used for visualization of results."},{"question":"Context:We are using deep learning in image analysis of cells for segmentation and classification in a research setting. So far, we can successfully segment the cells using the U-Net/CellPose Convolution Neural Network (CNN). The next step is to classify the cells based on the shape of the nuclei in a special petri dish. We have tried using a second CNN: the Mask R-CNN. This turned out to be a painful process as there is a lack of labelled data for this specific purpose.Question:Instead we want to use a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) as it is unsupervised. The problem is that the images coming from the segmentation algorithm have different sizes.Is it preferred to resize the images to a specific size like 512x512? Or rather to use an alternative like zero-padding, or using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) as the encoder?","answer":"Before deciding on an approach, it is important to understand how each method affects your data and the expected model performance. 1. Resizing can heavily distort and potentially lose meaningful information in an image. However, if the object of interest (cell nucleus) retains its defining features even after resizing, this could be a viable option.2. Zero-padding adds extra \'void\' data into your image to make all the images the same size. It avoids losing any information from the original images. However, if the padding is not carefully selected (i.e., too much padding), it might mislead the model during training, or dilute the valuable regions in the images, which can decrease performance.3. A Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) is a good option as it can accept inputs of any size. However, the smaller cells in larger images may become harder to accurately identify due to significantly less feature detail in lower resolution. Now, as you are using a VAE, you need to restructure your images (encoder output) to a densely connected layer. This requires a fixed input size; hence you either have to resize or pad your images before feeding them to your network. From your question, it seems cells\' sizes can vary a lot, hence using an FCN might capitalize on this variability.In research, there isn\'t always a one-size-fits-all solution. You could also try a multi-model comparison, using a subset of your data to test the resizing, zero-padding, and FCN methods. By doing this, you can potentially identify which method is best tailored to your specific dataset, without having to commit to a single strategy prematurely. You could also use techniques like data augmentation to generate more labelled data from your existing dataset."},{"question":"Devise a complex blueprint for a distributed ledger technology framework, specifically a blockchain, that is resistant to quantum computing threats, using your programming language of choice.

Furthermore, contemplate the potential impacts on system scalability and data privacy resulting from your design decisions, and justify your choices. Also, assess the potential effect on transaction speed and the economic feasibility of your proposed solution, taking into account the multi-layered rationalization and decision-making processes involved.","answer":"Creating a resilient distributed ledger technology like a blockchain capable of withstanding quantum computing threats, and integrating it with Machine Learning (ML) for optimum system performance, is indeed a complex task. A complete approach will consider all necessary technical, security, and economic elements.Just for the context, quantum computing exploits quantum phenomena to perform information operations. This can render some current encryption algorithms (like RSA and ECC used in cryptocurrencies) useless. Below is a high-level blueprint to approach this task: 1. Genesis: The system’s foundation will be a blockchain using post-quantum cryptography(PQC), capable of withstanding quantum computing decryption attempts. This includes using hash-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, or lattice-based cryptography that are considered quantum-resistant. Initial block generation would use similar cryptographic standards.2. Programming Language: Choice of programming language will largely depend on your prioritized factors like speed, ease of use, community support, etc. For instance, Python is excellent for fast development and includes several libraries for cryptography and ML but is slower than C, C++, and Java. Having said that, Python has rich libraries for cryptographic functions and machine learning such as PyCrypto, Hashlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch which can be effectively used in this task.3. Integration of Machine Learning Algorithm:Machine Learning can be used for multiple functionalities:   a. Transaction Management: Using Anomaly detection ML models, unusual transaction patterns can be detected and flagged for review.   b. Security: ML algorithms can be used to identify and predict potential security threats based on historical data and behaviour patterns.   c. System Functions: ML algorithms can further manage the overall health of the blockchain network, by monitoring transaction times, block sizes, chain length, and node health.4. Scalability and Data Privacy:The use of a robust PQC won\'t inherently prevent system scalability. However, the computational cost associated with the complex cryptographic measures could mean slower transaction times and therefore a scale limitation.Data privacy would be maintained through the use of PQC. Quantum-resistant encryption would ensure that only authorized personnel could access relevant data.5. Transaction Speed & Economic Feasibility:Transaction speeds will be heavily influenced by the computational complexity of the PQC. While transaction security would be improved, speed may be compromised.Economic feasibility will be a challenge. Implementing a quantum-resistant framework that uses ML will be costly. The computational demand, development time, and cost of expertise can be bulky.Justifying all the trade-offs, this system will be a robust, secure platform built with foresight for the potential future where quantum computing is more common. It amalgamates the advantages of blockchain, ML, and PQC providing a blend of security, efficiency, and optimised system function, making it worth the cost and effort in the long run."},{"question":"Create a JavaScript program that formats currency values for multiple countries.Consider the following additional tasks to increase the difficulty:1.

The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in the plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) concentration and platelet serotonin (5-hydroxytriptamine, 5-HT) content during the immediate headache and the delayed genuine migraine attack provoked by nitroglycerin. Fifteen female migraineurs (without aura) and eight controls participated in the study. Sublingual nitroglycerin (0.5 mg) was administered. Blood was collected from the antecubital vein four times: 60 min before and after the nitroglycerin application, and 60 and 120 min after the beginning of the migraine attack (mean 344 and 404 min; 12 subjects). In those subjects who had no migraine attack (11 subjects) a similar time schedule was used. Plasma CGRP concentration increased significantly (P<0.01) during the migraine attack and returned to baseline after the cessation of the migraine. In addition, both change and peak, showed significant positive correlations with migraine headache intensity (P<0.001). However, plasma CGRP concentrations failed to change during immediate headache and in the subjects with no migraine attack. Basal CGRP concentration was significantly higher and platelet 5-HT content tended to be lower in subjects who experienced a migraine attack. Platelet serotonin content decreased significantly (P<0.01) after nitroglycerin in subjects with no migraine attack but no consistent change was observed in patients with migraine attack. In conclusion, the fact that plasma CGRP concentration correlates with the timing and severity of a migraine headache suggests a direct relationship between CGRP and migraine. In contrast, serotonin release from platelets does not provoke migraine, it may even counteract the headache and the concomitant CGRP release in this model.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"5-HT\\", \\"serotonin\\", \\"5-hydroxytriptamine\\", \\"calcitonin gene-related peptide\\", \\"CGRP\\", \\"nitroglycerin\\", \\"NO\\"], \\"Disease\\": [\\"migraine\\", \\"migraineurs (without aura)\\", \\"headache\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a research paper, and a corresponding research question.

It seems like we are crossing from a concrete, structured data object like matrix, to abstract and unstructured concepts like cultural, historical and other terminologies. With that said, we can describe an algorithm to perform element-wise multiplication for three matrices: 1. Start the process.2. Check if the matrices are of same size, if not, stop the process and raise an error.3. Check if the elements of the matrices are either integer, floating point numbers, or complex numbers. If not, stop the process and raise an error.4. Check if any of the matrices have zero values. If so, stop the process and raise an error.5. Perform the element-wise multiplication operation on the three matrices.6. If the resulting matrix has determinant zero, stop the process and raise an error.7. If the resulting matrix is successfully created, store the result.8. Stop the process.This process should be optimized for memory usage and computational performance, as well as capable of handling sparse matrices and multi-threading for enhanced performance. Furthermore, the algorithm should allow the matrices to be stored in different formats or locations, utilizing different data structures or programming languages, and presenting on different operating systems.Any other needs such as managing complex numbers, non-square matrices, different type or size matrices etc. can be added into this algorithmic process as additional steps or conditions. However, the handling process needs to be defined or else it may cause confusion and errors. Should you have different needs or further clarification, feel free to ask."},{"question":"Write a function to find all adverbs ending with \'ly\', their positions, and their frequency in a given string.

This is because the position of a word cannot be uniquely determined if the word appears more than once in the text. This function thus returns the position of the word relative to the sentence in which it appears."},{"question":"Propose an appropriate data structure and its implementation to accommodate an inventory of various vehicles, specifically including automobiles and buses.","answer":"To accommodate an inventory of various vehicles (automobiles and buses), we can use an object-oriented programming approach with inheritance. We can create a base class called \\"Vehicle\\" and then two subclasses \\"Automobile\\" and \\"Bus\\". This way, we can use the base class to store the shared attributes, and the subclasses to store specific attributes for automobiles and buses.Here\'s an example implementation in Python:```pythonclass Vehicle:    def __init__(self, make, model, year, reg_number):        self.make = make        self.model = model        self.year = year        self.reg_number = reg_number    def __str__(self):        return f\'{self.year} {self.make} {self.model} (Reg: {self.reg_number})\'class Automobile(Vehicle):    def __init__(self, make, model, year, reg_number, num_doors, body_type):        super().__init__(make, model, year, reg_number)        self.num_doors = num_doors        self.body_type = body_type    def __str__(self):        return f\'{super().__str__()}, Doors: {self.num_doors}, Body: {self.body_type}\'class Bus(Vehicle):    def __init__(self, make, model, year, reg_number, num_passengers, bus_type):        super().__init__(make, model, year, reg_number)        self.num_passengers = num_passengers        self.bus_type = bus_type    def __str__(self):        return f\'{super().__str__()}, Passengers: {self.num_passengers}, Type: {self.bus_type}\'# Test the classesauto1 = Automobile(\\"Ford\\", \\"Fiesta\\", 2018, \\"AB1234CD\\", 4, \\"Hatchback\\")print(auto1)bus1 = Bus(\\"Mercedes-Benz\\", \\"Citaro\\", 2016, \\"EF5678GH\\", 50, \\"City Bus\\")print(bus1)```In this example, we create a base \\"Vehicle\\" class with common properties like make, model, year, and registration number.

Django is open-source and has a large and active community, which means that it has many third-party packages that can be used to add functionality to our project.For user registration and profile management, we will use Django\'s built-in User model and authentication system. For paper submission and peer review, we will create custom models and views. We will use Django\'s ORM for database operations.For the frontend, we will use Bootstrap, a free and open-source CSS framework, to ensure that our website is responsive and user-friendly. We will also use jQuery, a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library, to add interactivity to our website.To implement the search and filter function, we will use Django\'s Q objects for complex queries and the django-filter third-party package for filtering.## Python package name```python\\"academic_paper_platform\\"```## File list```python[    \\"manage.py\\",    \\"academic_paper_platform/settings.py\\",    \\"academic_paper_platform/urls.py\\",    \\"academic_paper_platform/wsgi.py\\",    \\"users/models.py\\",    \\"users/views.py\\",    \\"users/urls.py\\",    \\"papers/models.py\\",    \\"papers/views.py\\",    \\"papers/urls.py\\",    \\"reviews/models.py\\",    \\"reviews/views.py\\",    \\"reviews/urls.py\\",    \\"templates/base.html\\",    \\"templates/home.html\\",    \\"templates/user_profile.html\\",    \\"templates/paper_submission.html\\",    \\"templates/review_submission.html\\",    \\"static/css/main.css\\",    \\"static/js/main.js\\"]```## Data structures and interface definitions```mermaidclassDiagram    class User{        +str username        +str email        +str password        +str first_name        +str last_name        +date date_joined        +bool is_active        +bool is_staff        +bool is_superuser        --init__(username: str, email: str, password: str, first_name: str, last_name: str)    }    class Paper{        +int id        +str title        +str abstract        +str keywords        +date submission_date        +User author        --init__(title: str, abstract: str, keywords: str, author: User)    }    class Review{        +int id        +str content        +date submission_date        +User reviewer        +Paper paper        --init__(content: str, reviewer: User, paper: Paper)    }    User \\"1\\" -- \\"*\\" Paper: submits    User \\"1\\" -- \\"*\\" Review: writes    Paper \\"1\\" -- \\"*\\" Review: receives```## Program call flow```mermaidsequenceDiagram    participant U as User    participant P as Paper    participant R as Review    U->>P: submit_paper(title, abstract, keywords)    P->>U: confirm_submission()    U->>R: write_review(content, paper)    R->>U: confirm_submission()    U->>P: search_papers(keywords)    P->>U: return_results()```## Anything UNCLEARThe requirement is clear to me., Project Manager: ##

Angular automatically deals with memory management in most built-in directives or services, but developers are responsible for avoiding memory leaks with their custom observables.However, in your case, since the scope of the observable is bound to the component life cycle (until the component is destroyed), you don\'t need to unsubscribe from `valueChanges`. When the component is destroyed, the form and everything tied to it, including all value changes, is cleaned up. It\'s worth noting that in a different scenario where you might subscribe to an observable inside a service (the scope of which extends beyond the component lifetime), you will need to unsubscribe manually or use operators like `takeUntil`, `takeWhile` to handle unsubscription automatically. Use \'takeUntil\' in this way:```destroy = new Subject();constructor() {  userForm.get(\'fieldName\').valueChanges.pipe(takeUntil(this.destroy)).subscribe(value => console.log(value));}ngOnDestroy() {  this.destroy.next();  this.destroy.complete();}```Or \'takeWhile\':```alive = true;constructor() {  userForm.get(\'fieldName\').valueChanges.pipe(takeWhile(() => this.alive)).subscribe(value => console.log(value));}ngOnDestroy() {  this.alive = false;}```These will ensure that subscription to `valueChanges` gets terminated when the component gets destroyed, preventing memory leaks."},{"question":"Modify this CSS code to make the text color change from red to green gradually over 5 seconds when hovered over.div { font-family: \\"Helvetica\\", sans-serif; font-size: 1.5em;}","answer":"Sure, to solve this problem you can apply CSS transition properties.

This narrative should strive to reach the pinnacle of quantum cryptography while addressing inherent limitations within quantum entanglement, focusing on systematic methodologies for identifying and rectifying theoretical inconsistencies. Moreover, it should incorporate a sophisticated, structured analytical framework for surmounting obstacles, necessitating a diverse range of analytical skills and adaptable problem-solving capabilities. It should also spotlight potential impediments and their solutions, intertwined with a deep comprehension of entangled quantum states and their implications on quantum cryptography. Additionally, it should scrutinize the intricacies of quantum entanglement protocols and their execution, along with the most effective techniques for continuous monitoring and maintenance in the quantum entanglement domain. In conclusion, it should offer a rigorous evaluation of potential theoretical risks and the most effective strategies to ensure the ongoing evolution and widespread acceptance of quantum entanglement theories in the thriving era of quantum cryptography.

Could you also assess the potential repercussions of quantum entanglement on the wide-ranging spectrum of quantum mechanics, and how it might mold the future of quantum cryptography and quantum entanglement?","answer":"The exploration of quantum entanglement is like stepping through a looking glass into a world where particles, no matter how far apart, seem to act in correlation with one another in a way that defies classical understanding of physics. This seemingly derived from the mind of science fiction was identically theorized by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in their 1935 paper.The EPR paradox painted a surreal picture of our world, one which was unsettling for many, including Einstein himself, who described quantum entanglement as \\"spooky action at a distance.\\" But where Einstein saw a paradox, others saw promise. In this realm of everything’s being intertwined, they saw possibilities for codes that are fundamentally unbreakable.Fast forward to the 20th century, experiments have demonstrated the real essence of quantum entanglement; through tests like Bell\'s inequality and loophole-free Bell tests, we\'ve substantiated entanglement to be a real and fundamental part of the quantum world.Now, how does all of this play into quantum cryptography? The answer lies in the famous BB84 protocol. Proposed by Bennett and Brassard, this protocol leverages the peculiarity of entanglement to illustrate a secure way of sharing a cryptographic key. If someone attempts to intercept or eavesdrop on the transmission, their presence will collapse the system\'s quantum state and reveal their interception —an inherent feature that makes quantum cryptography undeniably secure.In terms of practical application, we see quantum cryptography in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems. However, there are prevalent challenges. Susceptibility to hacking via side-channels and the unsolved challenge of distances represent core obstacles. To overcome these, researchers are looking towards quantum repeaters and satellites, which can help extend the range and ensure secure key distribution on a global scale.While solving these problems, the field needs to accommodate nuances of entanglement, like monogamy, purification, and distillation, without disrupting the fine balance required for quantum coherence.In terms of potential implications, entanglement leads us towards a vast cosmos of quantum understanding: teleportation, dense coding, superdense teleportation, quantum computing, to name a few. Each of these concepts can revolutionize a specific region of technology, including communication, computation, or sensing.As we peer into the future trajectory of quantum cryptography and entanglement, it seems to be guided by a fusion of theoretical advancements and practical implementations. From fabrications of large-scale quantum networks, advancing quantum computers to addressing the philosophical questions around quantum theory, we see a future where quantum entanglement becomes an integral part of this reality, fostering an era of unimagined technological capabilities. Understanding quantum entanglement thoroughly will not be a quick or simple task. However, this venture, if successful, may potentially reshape our comprehension of physical reality and lead us into a new technological revolution, likened to the transition from classical to quantum mechanics."},{"question":"Develop a Java program that takes an integer input, N, and subsequently displays all the prime numbers smaller than N, while incorporating additional complexity by using a multi-step reasoning process.","answer":"Here\'s a simple Java program using a multi-step reasoning process to achieve the task:```javaimport java.util.Scanner;public class Main {    public static void main(String[] args) {               // Taking the integer input        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);        System.out.println(\\"Enter the number N: \\");        int N = scanner.nextInt();                // Using a multi-step reasoning process        boolean[] isPrime = new boolean[N];                for (int i = 0; i< N; i++){            isPrime[i] = true;        }                for (int p = 2; p*p <=N; p++){            // If isPrime[p] is not changed, then it is a prime            if(isPrime[p] == true)            {                // Update all multiples of p                for(int i = p*p; i < N; i += p)                    isPrime[i] = false;            }        }               // Displaying the prime numbers smaller than N        for(int i = 2; i < N; i++)        {            if(isPrime[i] == true)                System.out.println(i + \\" \\");        }    }}```Here\'s how the reasoning process works:1.

However, out of the box, the calendar is set to exclude weekends, which are typically non-business days.If you want to customize this behavior and include weekends or specific holidays, for example, you would need to subclass `BespokeCalendar` and implement your own `isBusinessDay()` method. This involves a bit of advanced programming and an understanding of how to work with the `QuantLib` library.Here is an example of how such a subclass might look:```pythonfrom QuantLib import *class MyCalendar(BespokeCalendar):    def __init__(self, name):        super(MyCalendar, self).__init__(name)    def isBusinessDay(self, date):        weekday = date.weekday()        if weekday == 5 or weekday == 6:     # For Saturday and Sunday            return True        return super(MyCalendar, self).isBusinessDay(date)```The method `isBusinessDay(date)` should return True if the given \\"date\\" should be considered a business day (i.e., if you want to add weekend days or any other specific dates), and False otherwise.Please note that this is a simple example and might not suit every use case as it is.

Please write a few sentences synthesizing the findings of these reports, which could serve as a conclusion section for a systematic review article. Your response should not include any other text. The RCT reports are below.Title 1:[Intra-umbilical administration of oxytocin in the treatment of retained placenta].Abstract 1:nanTitle 2:The effect of oxytocin injection into the umbilical vein for the management of the retained placenta.Abstract 2:In a single-blind study 51 patients with retention of the placenta were randomized into one of three groups: Group 1 was given 10 IU of oxytocin in 10 ml of sodium chloride into the umbilical vein; group 2 was given 10 ml of sodium chloride; group 3 was treated with manual removal of the placenta. No significant differences were recorded in groups 1 and 2, and no advantages were found in comparison with the procedure normally used.Title 3:Avoiding manual removal of placenta: evaluation of intra-umbilical injection of uterotonics using the Pipingas technique for management of adherent placenta.Abstract 3:Manual removal of placenta is performed in 1-3% of cases, and whilst a well established and relatively safe procedure, it is not without complications, which include infection, hemorrhage, uterine rupture, and occasional maternal death.                A three-arm randomized controlled trial of 50 IU Syntocinon (in 30 ml N saline) versus 800 mcg misoprostol (in 30 ml N saline) versus 30 ml N saline alone (control), injected into the placental bed via the umbilical vein using the Pipingas method. A group sequential research model (triangular test: PEST4) was adopted to minimize the sample size, as retained placenta is a relatively uncommon condition.                No significant difference in the rate of manual removal was observed between the control and Syntocinon groups. On triggering the automatic stopping rule for this arm of the trial all subsequent cases recruited were allocated to receive either Syntocinon or misoprostol. After a total of 54 cases a significant reduction in manual removal of placenta was observed in the misoprostol group, triggering the automatic stopping rule and terminating the trial.                Misoprostol (800 mcg) dissolved in 30 ml N saline and administered by intraumbilical injection using the Pipingas technique significantly reduces the need for manual removal for retained adherent placenta, whereas Syntocinon has similar effectiveness to injection of N saline alone.Title 4:Intraumbilical oxytocin for the management of retained placenta: a randomized controlled trial.Abstract 4:To evaluate the ability of intraumbilical oxytocin injection as a treatment for retained placenta after vaginal delivery to reduce the incidence of manual removal and postpartum hemorrhage.                A randomized controlled trial was set up in a university and a district general hospital. We recruited 81 women with singleton pregnancies who underwent vaginal delivery and who failed to deliver the placenta after 20 minutes of active management of the third stage of labor. Study subjects were randomized to receive either 1) an intraumbilical injection of oxytocin (20 IU in 20 mL of saline); 2) an intraumbilical injection of saline (20 mL); or 3) no treatment. Outcome measures were expulsion of the placenta within 45 minutes of delivery, need for manual removal of the placenta under anesthesia, and postpartum hemorrhage (defined as a blood loss greater than 500 mL).                Women given an intraumbilical injection of oxytocin had a significant increase in spontaneous expulsion of the placenta within 45 minutes of delivery and fewer manual removals of the placenta, compared with women without treatment (odds ratio [OR] 11.6, 99% confidence interval [CI] 1.4, 272.8; and OR 7.4, 99% CI 1.1, 86.5; respectively). When women given intraumbilical oxytocin were compared with women given only intraumbilical saline, the difference was not statistically significant (OR 6.6, 99% CI 0.9, 77.2 for spontaneous expulsion of the placenta; and OR 4.7, 99% CI 0.8, 39.5 for manual removal). There was no significant difference in the incidence of spontaneous expulsion and manual removal of the placenta between women given intraumbilical saline injection and women without treatment (OR 1.8, 99% CI 0.1, 53.9; and OR 1.6, 99% CI 0.1, 22.4; respectively).                The results of our study suggest a clinically important beneficial effect of intraumbilical oxytocin injection in the management of retained placenta.Title 5:Intraumbilical vein injection of prostaglandin F2 alpha in retained placenta.Abstract 5:A randomized protocol was used to study the effect of intraumbilical prostaglandin F2 alpha (Hembate, Upjohn) and oxytocin injection in women with retained placenta. Prostaglandin F2 alpha, 20 mg, diluted to 20 ml in normal saline solution (10 women, group 1), 30 IU of oxytocin, diluted to 20 ml in normal saline solution (11 women, group 2), or 20 ml of normal saline solution alone (7 women, group 3), were injected into the umbilical vein 1 h after delivery. Nine women (group 4, controls) underwent manual removal of the retained placenta. In group 1, placental expulsion occurred in all patients and the duration of the placental expulsion after prostaglandin F2 alpha injection was 6.8 +/- 1.36 (mean +/- SE) min: in group 2, six placental expulsions occurred after 13.3 +/- 1.97 min (mean +/- SE); and in group 3, no effect was recorded after intraumbilical saline injection. We suggest that intraumbilical vein injection of prostaglandin F2 alpha might be a beneficial, non-surgical method for treating retained placenta. Oxytocin might reduce the incidence of manual lysis of the placenta and achieve partial success.Title 6:Intra-umbilical vein injection and retained placenta: evidence from a collaborative large randomised controlled trial. Grupo Argentino de Estudio de Placenta Retenida.Abstract 6:To determine whether intra-umbilical vein injection with saline solution, with or without oxytocin, reduces the need for manual removal of placenta compared with expectant management.                Multicenter, randomised controlled trial.                Eleven hospitals in four cities of Argentina: Buenos Aires, Corrientes, Rosario, and Salta.                Two hundred and ninety-one women showing no evidence of placental separation thirty minutes after vaginal delivery.                Three different management strategies: 1. intra-umbilical vein injection of saline solution plus oxytocin; 2. intra-umbilical vein injection of saline solution alone; and 3. expectant management.                Primary: manual removal of the placenta. Secondary: blood loss after trial entry, haemoglobin level at 24 to 48 hours and at 40 to 45 days after delivery, blood transfusion, curettage, infection, and days of hospital stay.                Rates of subsequent manual removal were similar: intra-umbilical vein injection of saline solution plus oxytocin (58%; RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.73-1.15), or saline alone (63%; RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.80-1.24), compared with expectant management (63%). There were also no detectable effects of the active managements on any of the secondary measures of outcome.                Based on evidence available from randomised controlled trials, including this trial, it is unlikely that intra-umbilical injection with or without oxytocin, is clinically useful. We recommend that this intervention should not be used in third stage management of labour.Title 7:Is there a place for intra-umbilical oxytocin for the management of retained placenta?Abstract 7:Intra-umbilical injection of oxytocin has been used to hasten placental separation in retained placenta. A randomised controlled trial was done on 35 consequent women who fulfilled the criteria for retained placenta at the Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology Ipoh Hospital. Nineteen patients who were recruited into the study group received intraumbilical injection of 301U oxytocin in 27mls saline. Another 16 patients who were in the control group received 30mls of 0.9% sodium chloride (placebo). The primary outcome measured was the need for manual removal of placenta (MRP). Nine out of the 19 patients in the oxytocin group required MRP while 10/16 in the control group required MRP. There was a 24% reduction (95% C.I. 0.41 to 1.39) in the need for MRP in the study group compared to the saline group. our results indicate that intra-umbilical vein injection of oxytocin is not clinically useful for the removal of a retained placenta.Title 8:Removing a retained placenta by oxytocin--a controlled study.Abstract 8:No increase in maternal plasma oxytocin concentration was detected after administration of 100 IU oxytocin into the umbilical veins of seven women immediately after delivery. The delivery of the placenta was accelerated after umbilical vein injection of 100 IU oxytocin in a placebo-controlled study of 40 women: 12 minutes (4 to 40) in the oxytocin group versus 40 minutes (29 to 40) in the placebo group (median and interquartile ranges), p less than 0.05.Title 9:Intraumbilical oxytocin for management of retained placenta.Abstract 9:The purpose of the study was to investigate the removal of a retained placenta.                Oxytocin was injected into the vein of the umbilical cord. A total of 109 patients with retention of the placenta were randomized into two groups. Active management of the third stage of labor was carried out by giving oxytocin 5 IU intravenously and ergometrine maleate 0.2 mg intramuscularly after delivery of the fetus. Group 1, which comprised 68 patients, was allocated to receive 50 IU oxytocin diluted in 10 ml 0.9% sodium chloride solution, and the 41 patients in group 2 were given 20 ml plasma expander (dextran 70) into the umbilical vein.                Forty-nine cases (72%) in the oxytocin group and 22 cases (54%) in the dextran 70 group required manual removal of the retained placenta. No significant differences were found between group 1 (oxytocin) and group 2 (dextran 70).                Our results indicate that intraumbilical vein injection of oxytocin is not effective for removal of a retained placenta.Title 10:Umbilical vein administration of oxytocin for the management of retained placenta: is it effective?Abstract 10:In a multicenter randomized controlled trial involving 220 women with retained placenta no beneficial effects could be established of intraumbilical vein administration of 10 IU of oxytocin in 20 ml of saline solution. A reduction was not gained in the rate of manual removal of the placenta and there was no decrease in the amount of blood loss. Oxytocin only induced a minor shortening of the median time interval from administration to the spontaneous expulsion of the placenta as compared with a placebo injection. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels before and after intraumbilical vein injection did not show evidence of fetomaternal transfusion.","answer":"UVI of oxytocin solution is an inexpensive and simple intervention that could be performed while placental delivery is awaited. However, high-quality randomized trials show that the use of oxytocin has little or no effect. Further research into the optimal timing of manual removal and into UVI of prostaglandins or plasma expander is warranted."},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

Background : Mind-w and ering is thought to interfere with goal -directed thought . It is likely , then , that when driving , mind-w and ering might lead to impairments in critical aspects of driving performance . In two experiments , we assess the extent to which mind-w and ering interferes with responsiveness to sudden events , mean velocity , and headway distance . Method : Using a car-following procedure in a high-fidelity driving simulator  , participants were probed at r and om times to indicate whether they were on-task at that moment or mind-w and ering . The dependent measures were analyzed based on the participant ’s response to the probe . Results : Compared to when on-task , when mind-w and ering participants showed longer response times to sudden events , drove at a higher velocity , and maintained a shorter headway distance . Conclusion : Collectively , these findings indicate that mind-w and ering affects a broad range of driving responses and may therefore lead to higher crash risk . Application : The results suggest that situations that are likely associated with mind-w and ering ( e.g. , route familiarity ) can impair driving performanceTitle 2:Task unrelated thought whilst encoding informationAbstract 2:Task unrelated thought ( TUT ) refers to thought directed away from the current situation , for example a daydream . Three experiments were conducted on healthy participants , with two broad aims . First , to contrast distributed and encapsulated views of cognition by comparing the encoding of categorical and r and om lists of words ( Experiments One and Two ) . Second , to examine the consequences of experiencing TUT during study on the subsequent retrieval of information ( Experiments One , Two , and Three ) . Experiments One and Two demonstrated lower levels of TUT and higher levels of word-fragment completion whilst encoding categorical relative to r and om stimuli , supporting the role of a distributed re source in the maintenance of TUT . In addition the results of all three experiments suggested that experiencing TUT during study had a measurable effect on subsequent retrieval . TUT was associated with increased frequency of false alarms at retrieval ( Experiment One ) . In the subsequent experiments TUT was associated with no advantage to retrieval based on re collection , by manipulating instructions at encoding ( Experiment Two ) , and /or at retrieval ( Experiment Three ) . The implication s of the results of all three experiments are discussed in terms of recent accounts of memory retrieval and conscious awarenessTitle 3:The effects of mindfulness on executive processes and autobiographical memory specificity.Abstract 3:Previous studies have found that mindfulness training reduces overgeneral memories and increases autobiographical memory specificity ( e.g. , [ Williams , J. M. G. , Teasdale , J. D. , Segal , Z. V. , & Soulsby , J. ( 2000 ) . Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy reduces overgeneral autobiographical memory in formerly depressed patients . Journal of Abnormal Psychology , 109 , 150 - 155 ] ) . However , little work has investigated the mechanisms underlying this effect . The present study explored the role of executive processes as a mediator of MBCT effects in an unselected sample .  An autobiographical memory task , a cognitive inhibition task , a motor inhibition task , a cognitive flexibility task and a motor flexibility task  were administered before and after intervention . Compared to matched controls , MBCT participants showed increased autobiographical memory specificity , decreased overgenerality , and improved cognitive flexibility capacity and capacity to inhibit cognitive prepotent responses . Mediational analyses indicated that changes in cognitive flexibility partially mediate the impact of MBCT on overgeneral memories . Results are discussed in terms of Conway \'s [ 2005 .

16 ( 80% ) patients were male .the infecting exposure could not be established for all patients because multiple exposures , human and avian , were recorded for some .of the 4 patients with laboratory - confirmed cases , 3 were treated with oseltamivir ( 2 [ 67% ] of whom survived ) , and 1 had asymptomatic disease and received no antiviral treatment .signs and symptoms were mainly those of a febrile influenza - like illness ( table 2 ) , although 1 patient with a laboratory - confirmed case was asymptomatic ( microneutralization titer 320 , western blot positive , throat swab positive for h5 by reverse transcription  pcr ) ; this case - patient was also described in a previous epidemiologic investigation ( 2 ) .the index case - patient ( patient 1 ) had culled influenza ( h5n1 ) virus  infected poultry . after becoming febrile ( 38c ) while in abbottabad , he traveled by public transportation to his family home in peshawar .his illness progressed and on november 5 , 2007 , he was admitted to khyber teaching hospital , where the diagnosis of influenza ( h5n1 ) infection was made .infection appeared to spread initially from household family contacts ( patients 26 ) to medical staff ( patient 7 , who had positive pcr but negative microneutralization test results ) and to a frequent visitor to the intensive care unit ( patient 8) .path of infection of influenza ( h5n1 ) , pakistan , 2007 . during october 2230 ,patient 1 worked culling infected chickens ; on november 2 , he moved home and had contact with 4 brothers ( patients 25 ) and possibly a cousin ( patient 6 ) .he was hospitalized on november 5 and transferred to an intensive care unit the next day .his cousin cared for him and became patient 6 ; his attending doctor became patient 7 . on november 23 , patient 3 was hospitalized and on november 28 was transferred to an intensive care unit ; during this time , patient 8 frequently visited his wife in the same intensive care unit . as previously noted ( 2 ) , the extended period from the time persons were exposed to the index case - patient , during which family members became ill , points to human - to - human - to - human transmission ; patient 2 probably accounted for intermediary or second - generation infection .the chain of infection illustrated in figure 2 suggests that further human - to - human - to - human transmission might have occurred and suggests nosocomial transmission . of note ,patient 6 ( a cousin of the index case - patient ) had a microneutralization titer of 80 but a negative western blot result .although 4 contacts of patient 6 exhibited no signs or symptoms of influenza , they did have positive h5 microneutralization titers ranging from 80 to 160 .no evidence epidemiologically links the remaining 12 patients to the 8 patients in the cluster ; each of the 12 either had direct contact with influenza ( h5n1 ) virus  infected poultry or was near healthy or diseased poultry before symptom onset .three patients worked on poultry farms : 1 had taken a sample from an influenza ( h5n1 ) virus  infected chicken , 1 was directly involved in culling , and 1 was indirectly exposed to live poultry .eight patients had negative test results for influenza ( h5n1 ) virus , and 3 had positive results from the national institute of health islamabad but negative confirmatory - testing results from who ; 1 patient died before samples could be taken .different laboratories reported conflicting results with respect to confirmation of infection , possibly because of the difficulties of complying with specimen - handling requirements in resource - poor settings .the preponderance of male patients is probably explained by sociocultural factors ; the index case - patient was a poultry culler , a male - dominated task , and shared accommodation with male family members .the human - to - human transmission from the index case - patient to at least some household contacts seems clear , and the extended period over which these contacts became ill supports subsequent human - to - human transmission .figure 2 supports the conclusion that patient 2 initiated a chain of infection in which further human - to - human transmission to patients 7 and 8 occurred .possible nosocomial transmission is of concern because full implementation of isolation procedures in resource - poor settings may be problematic .although virologically supported probable human - to - human transmission of influenza ( h5n1 ) virus has been documented , it has been thought to occur only with prolonged and close contact ( 4 ) .household clustering and the difficulty of establishing exact virus exposures have encumbered efforts to investigate possible human - to - human transmission ( 5 ) .modeling has ( 6 ) suggested human - to - human transmission in indonesia , but the utility of statistical modeling unsupported by field data has been questioned ( 7 ) .although the index case - patient traveled by public transportation from abbottabad , where he acquired his infection , no infections were reported for anyone other than household contacts , who were all related and exposed at his family home at peshawar .in contrast , patients 2 and 6 might have spread infection through less intimate contact , which raises 2 questions .might some persons shed virus more efficiently than others , possibly in greater quantity ? and what role might host factors play in susceptibility to influenza ( h5n1 ) virus infection and disease ?a degree of virus adaptation to humans might also have occurred , although absence of sustained community transmission argues against this possibility .of concern is the 4:1 ratio of likely / possible to laboratory - confirmed cases , suggesting that official tallies understate true incidence of infection .factors that may contribute to undercounting are the difficulty of obtaining virologic confirmation or of storing and transporting samples in resource - poor settings and reluctance by relatives to consent to autopsy .another reason to believe that less fulminant cases may go unreported is the occurrence in pakistan , and elsewhere , of clinically mild and asymptomatic cases ( 5,814 ) , indicating that influenza ( h5n1 ) virus may cause a spectrum of illness .the demonstration during the 1997 hong kong outbreak of influenza ( h5n1 ) with seroconversion in apparently asymptomatic health care workers and social contacts suggests human - to - human transmission , although in hanoi , no transmission to health care workers was detected ( 8,13,15 ) . also contributing to underreporting arethe predominant clinical signs of undifferentiated influenza - like illness observed in pakistan and elsewhere , which , unless clinical deterioration occurred , would be unremarkable in many tropical settings .although the survival rate was greater for patients who received oseltamivir , the small number of patients and the inclusion of those with mild and asymptomatic illness prevent meaningful statistical comparison .several features of the outbreak are unusual or give cause for concern : human - to - human - to - human transmission , possible nosocomial transmission , occurrence of mild and asymptomatic cases , and difficulties of establishing laboratory confirmation of likely and possible cases ( which also prevented genotypic matching of specimens from primary and putative secondary cases ) . taken together , these features suggest that current surveillance might undercount the extent of human infection with influenza ( h5n1 ) virus and that human - to - human transmission might possibly be associated with less severe disease .","answer":"human infection with avian influenza ( h5n1 ) virus raises concern for the possibility of a pandemic .  we report 20 cases , which ranged from asymptomatic to fatal , in pakistan in 2007 .  these cases indicate human - to - human - to - human transmission of this virus , and the number of cases may be higher than realized ."},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

Previous studies on the role of Notch in the lung focused mostly on Notch pathway core components or receptor-specific functions. It is unclear, however, how Jagged or Delta-like ligands collectively or individually( Jag1, Jag2, Dll1, Dll4) influence differentiation of airway epithelial progenitors. Using mouse genetic models we show major differences in Jag and Dll in regulation and establishment of cell fate. Jag ligands had a major impact in balancing distinct cell populations in conducting airways, but had no role in the establishment of domains and cellular abundance in the neuroendocrine( NE) microenvironment. Surprisingly, Dll ligands were crucial in restricting cell fate and size of NE bodies and showed an overlapping role with Jag in differentiation of NE-associated secretory( club) cells. These mechanisms may potentially play a role in human conditions that result in aberrant NE differentiation, including NE hyperplasias and cancer.Introduction:Notch signaling is a major regulator of progenitor cell fate and differentiation during organogenesis, repair-regeneration, and cancer. In mammals, four Notch receptors( Notch1–4) and five ligands( Delta-like: Dll1, Dll3 and Dll4 and Jagged: Jag1 and Jag2) have been described. All ligands, except Dll3, are Notch activating. Signaling is triggered by ligand-receptor binding through cell-cell interactions, which leads to sequential cleavage of the Notch receptor and binding of its intracellular domain( NICD) to a CSL/RBPJk-activator complex for activation of downstream target genes, such as HEY/HES-family members( Radtke and Raj, 2003; Bray, 2006). While different Notch receptors are known to act in a variety of biological processes, evidence from genetic studies suggest that the Notch effects are not necessarily dependent on the type of NICD but rather of NICD dosage( Liu et al., 2015). Notably, specific Notch ligand-receptor binding in mammalian cells appears to be mostly non-selective or context-dependent. Interestingly, systemic deletion of Jag1, Jag2, or Dll4 has been shown to result in distinct phenotypes, suggesting that these ligands could mediate unique functions not entirely due to the receptor they activate( D\'Souza et al., 2009; Choi et al., 2009). Indeed, Notch ligands were reported to activate distinct targets even through binding to the same Notch receptor and ligand-specific effects have been observed in multiple contexts( Nandagopal et al., 2018). The Notch pathway plays a crucial role in the developing lung. When airways are still forming epithelial progenitors initiate a differentiation program that gives rise to secretory( club, goblet), multiciliated, and neuroendocrine( NE) cells. Previous studies addressing the role of Notch in the lung focused largely on central components of this pathway( Rbpjk, Pofut1, and Hes1). Disruption of Rbpjk or the o-fucosyl-transferase Pofut1 required for Notch signaling results in aberrant expansion of multiciliated and NE cells at the cost of secretory cells( Tsao et al., 2009; Tsao et al., 2011; Morimoto et al., 2010). Subsequent studies showed that club cells are more sensitive to deficiency in Notch2 while Notch 1-3 receptors contribute to control the NE population in an additive manner( Morimoto et al., 2012). However, it was unclear whether individual ligand families( Delta-like and Jagged) or specific ligands( Dll1, Dll4, Jag1, and Jag2) influence distinct aspects of differentiation of airway epithelial progenitors. Notably, these ligands have been reported in partially overlapping but also distinct domains in the lung( Post et al., 2000; Kong et al., 2004; Tsao et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2010b; Zhang et al., 2013; Mori et al., 2015). Here we explored the role of ligands using single and double conditional Jagged and Delta-like null alleles targeted to epithelial progenitors from early lung development. We show remarkably distinct roles of these ligands in the developing intra- and extrapulmonary airways and in the control of the expansion and differentiation of the NE microenvironment.Discussion:Here we provide evidence for distinct roles of Notch ligands once epithelial progenitors initiate differentiation. We show that Jagged-driven Notch signaling differentially regulates cell type-specific programs of cell fate in a temporal and spatial fashion along the developing respiratory tract epithelium. In extrapulmonary airways( largely trachea here) we found that Jag ligands are not required to induce or maintain the fate of basal cell precursors. These precursors are known to generate luminal cells in fetal airways( Yang et al., 2018) and we now report that double Jag1 and Jag2 deletion leads to a major imbalance between the basal and luminal compartments with an expansion of basal cell precursors. By contrast, loss of both Jag ligands in intrapulmonary airways had no detectable impact on the NEB microenvironment. Unexpectedly, we found that Dll inactivation in Dll1cnull; Dll4cnull mutants resulted in marked expansion of NEBs and their associated secretory cells. Our analysis of the ontogeny of Notch ligands showed that Jag2 is expressed well before Jag1 in the epithelium and that both Dll1 and Dll4 appear only after NEBs form in intrapulmonary airways. Establishment of NE vs non-NE fate is known to be associated with induction of Ascl1 and a classic mechanism of lateral inhibition involving activation of Notch-Hes1 in neighboring cells( Borges et al., 1997; Ito et al., 2000; Collins et al., 2004). Interestingly, although Ascl1-labeled NE precursors have been reported in the embryonic lung as early as E12. 5, we found no expression of Dll( or Jag) ligands by these cells prior to E13. 5( Figure 1; Beckers et al., 1999; Post et al., 2000; Li and Linnoila, 2012; Kuo and Krasnow, 2015). This was intriguing since there is evidence that Hes1 is expressed and already active early in the developing lung epithelium in spite of no evidence of ligand expression in intrapulmonary airways to activate Notch signaling nearby NE cells( Tsao et al., 2009; Noguchi et al., 2015). This suggests that at these initial stages NE vs. non-NE cell fate selection is mediated by Hes1 in a Notch-independent fashion. Consistent with this, Hes1 deletion in lung epithelial progenitors at the onset of lung development( Shhcre/+; Hes1flox/flox) results in aberrant expansion of NEB precursors as early as E13. 5( Noguchi et al., 2015). Hes1-dependency on Notch is likely established at later developmental stages and could explain why genetic inactivation of the key Notch pathway components Pofut1 or Rbpjk using the ShhCre driver( the same used to delete Hes1, above), had no apparent effect in NE abundance at early( E14. 5) stages compared to the severe effects at later( E18. 5) stages( Tsao et al., 2009) and not shown). Our Dll1cnull; Dll4cnull mutants provided the first genetic proof that these ligands are crucially involved in regulating the size the NEBs, with no clear role in controlling other aspects such as the number of PNECs or NEBs per airway. By contrast, Jag ligands had no detectable influence in NEB size or abundance. Even at E14. 5, when NEBs are forming along the proximal-distal axis of intrapulmonary airways, Jag2 is still strongly expressed only at partially overlapping proximal domains such that nascent distal clusters of Ascl1+ cells arise in non-Jag2 or non-Jag1-expressing areas( Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Together our data suggest a model for the role of Notch ligands in lung development( Figure 7) in which early, when epithelial progenitors start to differentiate, a wave of Jag-Notch activation initiating in the trachea progresses in a proximal-distal fashion to establish the balance of secretory vs. multiciliated cell fates in intrapulmonary airways. A program of NE cell fate also emerges in intrapulmonary airways and as NEB start to express Dll ligands, Dll-Notch signaling is turned on in adjacent cells to form NEB-associated CCs. Local activation of Notch signaling in these cells shelters the NEB microenvironment from the neighboring epithelium, preventing aberrant NEB expansion. This role is restricted to Dll1 and Dll4, given that Jag1, Jag2 single or double mutants showed no detectable effect in the size of NEBs, NEB-associated CCs or local Notch activation. The NEB microenvironment is maintained by Dll ligands that induce Notch to maintain the local balance of NE and non-NE cell types. The relevance of a late Notch-dependent phase is underscored by the expansion of the NE domain when Dll ligands are unavailable to induce Notch to generate NE-associated CCs locally. Our observations are not in conflict with recent reports that describe aggregation of NEB by a mechanism of NE cell migration( slithering)( Kuo and Krasnow, 2015; Noguchi et al., 2015; Branchfield et al., 2016). Rather we envision that the cell fate specification events described above precede these migratory and cluster-forming events, or overlap at least partially with mechanisms reported here. Intriguingly, in spite of the absence of Dll ligands and having Jag1 and Jag2 as the sole ligands available, the NEB-associated CC in Dll1cnull; Dll4cnull airways exhibited robust Notch activation and maintained the unique features of CCs in this microenvironment( strong Upk3a, SSEA1, and low Cyp2f2). This suggested that the features above do not necessarily depend on the differential activation of Notch by NE-derived Dll ligands and can result from Jag-Notch activation in the cells immediately adjacent to NEBs. We speculate that a currently unidentified cell membrane-associated component of NE cells or a short-range diffusible signal( s) emanating from NEBs modulates Notch signaling or influences the cell fate program in adjacent CCs to endow these features( Figure 7). Lastly, the strength of receptor-ligand interactions is well known to depend on post-translational modifications of Notch receptors, particularly by the family of Fringe proteins, Lunatic( Lfng), Manic( Mfng) and Radical( Rfng)( Stanley and Okajima, 2010). Mass spectrometric analysis has demonstrated Lfng to promote Notch activation by Dll1 and decrease its activation by Jag1( Kakuda and Haltiwanger, 2017). Lfng is expressed in NEBs rather than in the NEB-associated CCs, which activates Notch signaling( Xu et al., 2010b; Xu et al., 2010a). This is reminiscent of the developing intestinal epithelium where Fringe is expressed in the ligand-presenting cells to promote Notch activity in the neighboring cells( Kadur Lakshminarasimha Murthy et al., 2018). There is currently no evidence that these proteins influence epithelial Notch signaling in the developing lung epithelium( van Tuyl et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2010b; Xu et al., 2010a). In summary our study provides novel insights into developmental mechanisms mediated by Jag/Dll/Notch in the lung. These observations could be of significance in studies of human conditions associated with aberrant expansion or differentiation of NEBs and their associated CCs. Indeed, analysis of human biopsies from normal donors and patients with pulmonary NE cell hyperplasias suggest that both the NE and NE-associated CC components are coordinately altered( Guha et al., 2017). Further studies examining the impact of Notch ligands and downstream signals in these diseases are likely to provide important insights into their pathogenesis.","answer":"Cells communicate with each other by sending messages through a range of signaling pathways . One of the ways cells signal to each other is through a well-studied pathway known as Notch . In this pathway , cells display molecules on their surface , known as Notch ligands , that can activate Notch receptor proteins on the surface of neighboring cells . Once the Notch receptors bind to these ligands , they trigger various responses inside the cell . Notch ligands exist in two different families: Delta-like ( Dll ) ligands and Jagged ( Jag ) ligands . The layer of cells that lines the airways in the lungs consists of several different cell types . These include secretory cells that produce the fluid covering the airway surface , multiciliated cells , and neuroendocrine cells . Together these cells work as a barrier to protect the lung from environmental particles that may be breathed in . Additionally , the lung also has multipotent progenitor cells , which can become any of the other types . When Notch signaling is missing from the lung during embryonic development , not enough secretory cells are made , while other cell types are made in excess . This is because the multipotent progenitor cells need to communicate via Notch signaling to decide what type of cell to become and keep the right proportion of different cell types in the airways . In other organs , multipotent progenitors can become different types of cells depending on whether Notch signaling was activated by Dll or by Jag ligands , but it was unknown if this also happened in the lungs . Stupnikov et al . investigated the situation in the airways during development by looking at where and when Dll and Jag ligands first appeared , and by inactivating the genes that code for these ligands . They found that Jag ligands appeared well before Dll ligands , and that when the genes coding for Jag ligands were inactivated , more ciliated cells were produced . By contrast , loss of Dll ligands resulted in an increase in the neuroendocrine and their associated secretory cells , with little effect on the multiciliated cells . This increase resembled what is seen in some human diseases . The results suggest that the diversity of Notch effects in the airways depends on which Notch ligand is locally available . These observations may help to understand the mechanism of certain diseases involving neuroendocrine cells in the lung , such as small cell carcinoma or bronchial carcinoid tumors ."},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

However the benefits of this agent in reducing disease progression and relapse rate cannot be sustained in the long-term, as treatment is limited by the potential for cumulative cardiotoxicity. We report our experience utilising glatiramer Acetate as maintenance immuno-modulatory treatment following initial immunosuppression with mitoxantrone in a consecutive series of 27 patients with very active relapsing remitting disease, eight of whom had experienced continuing relapse activity on first-line treatment. Duration of treatment with mitoxantrone and thereby cumulative dose were reduced as our experience with the combination increased.No unanticipated side effects of combination treatment were encountered over a follow-up period of 66 months. A single patient developed therapy related acute leukaemia (TRAL) 9 months after completion of mitoxantrone.A sustained 90% reduction in annualised relapse rate (p < 0.001) has been observed. Disability is stable or improved in all patients a mean of 36 (16-66) months from initiation of treatment. Early suppression of relapse activity with mitoxantrone has been maintained at a mean of 22 months from last dose of this agent.

The `derivative` function first creates a result vector of the size of input vector xs. Then a transform method applies a lambda function on each element of the xs vector. This lambda function increments n by 1 for each element (to start counting from 1 instead of 0), multiplies the element by e^(1/n), and returns the result. The result is stored in the result vector."},{"question":"Create a CSS flexbox container with 4 evenly spaced rows.","answer":"In order to create a CSS flexbox container with 4 evenly spaced rows, the following code snippet can be used:```html<!-- HTML Structure --><div class=\\"flex-container\\">  <div class=\\"flex-item\\">Row 1</div>  <div class=\\"flex-item\\">Row 2</div>  <div class=\\"flex-item\\">Row 3</div>  <div class=\\"flex-item\\">Row 4</div></div>``````css/* CSS Styling *//* Define flex-container styling */.flex-container {  /* Make the container a flex container */  display: flex;  /* Set the direction of the flex items - column makes them stack vertically */  flex-direction: column;  /* Distibute the row-space in between the row */  justify-content: space-between;  /* Define a height to allow for spaced items */  height: 400px;}/* Create identical styling for all flex-items */.flex-item {  /* For demo purposes, so you can see the boxes clearly */  border: 1px solid black;  /* Again for demo purposes, just adding a little padding */  padding: 10px;  /* Center the text in the middle of the row */  text-align: center;}```In this case, four divs (representing the four rows) are created within the flex-container.

Oxysterols have been shown to interfere with proliferation and cause the death of many cancer cell types, such as leukaemia, glioblastoma, colon, breast and prostate cancer cells, while they have little or no effect on senescent cells. The mechanisms by which oxysterols may influence proliferation are manifold: they control the transcription and the turnover of the key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, by binding to Insig-1, Insig-2 and liver X receptors. Oxysterols are thought to be generated in proportion to the rate of cholesterol synthesis. Although there is no consensus about the mechanism by which these oxysterols are generated in vivo, it clearly has to be ubiquitous. The 25- and the 27-cholesterol hydroxylases, present in almost all tissues, are possible candidates. Cholesterol uptake from lipoproteins, intracellular vesicle transport and lipid transfer are also modified by oxysterols. Oxysterols interfere with ERK, hedgehog and wnt pathways of proliferation and differentiation. When administered in vitro to cancer cell lines, oxysterols invariably both slow down proliferation and provoke cell death. Perhaps is it sufficient to stop proliferation of a cancer to provoke its eradication. Therefore, the two facets of oxysterol action that seem important for cancer treatment, cytostaticity and cytotoxicity, will be discussed.","answer":"[[\\"Oxysterols\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"wnt\\"], [\\"oxysterols\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"lipoproteins\\"], [\\"Cholesterol\\", \\"SUBSTRATE\\", \\"lipoproteins\\"], [\\"Oxysterols\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"hedgehog\\"], [\\"Oxysterols\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"ERK\\"]]"},{"question":"Write a function in C that takes a string as input.

Django automatically manages migration files when they are placed in the default location. Moving them could cause the framework to lose track of them, resulting in errors during the migration process.   2. It might confuse other developers who are accustomed to find migration files in their default location. It could also break any tools or scripts that expect migrations to be in the default location.

Can you provide a comprehensive evaluation of the unique advantages and potential competitive superiority this decision might confer, with a special emphasis on elements such as scalability, cost-efficiency, and effortless incorporation? Furthermore, could you also delve into the potential impact of this course of action on the holistic performance and security facets of the application, including but not limited to data integrity, latency, and threat mitigation?","answer":"Integrating Amazon Web Services\' DynamoDB into your tech stack as a Python developer could prove to be a sagacious move, providing a multitude of advantages mainly focusing on scalability, cost-efficiency, and easy incorporation. Scalability: DynamoDB is a fully-managed NoSQL database service that allows for seamless scalability. This feature would enable your web application to handle increased traffic effortlessly without any substantial degradation in performance. With DynamoDB, you can start with a modest set-up, and as your user base expands, you can scale your database to handle terabytes of data and thousands of read/write operations per second. Cost Efficiency: DynamoDB operates on a pay-per-use model. Therefore, you only pay for the read and write throughput you utilize, along with the storage that your application needs. Due to this metered pricing model, you\'re not stuck overpaying for provisioning upfront. This scalability could result in significant cost savings for your application.Effortless Incorporation: Python language has robust support for AWS, including DynamoDB. Amazon offers a software development kit - Boto3, which has comprehensive support for DynamoDB operations. This makes integration and operating with DynamoDB using Python very effortless.Performance: DynamoDB comes with built-in caching via DAX (DynamoDB Accelerator), significantly reducing response times and improving read efficiency. So overall latency would see a significant reduction. Security: AWS DynamoDB comes with integrated IAM (Identity Access management), enabling you to set fine-graded access rules for your database on a need-to-know basis. It also includes encryption at rest, securing your data at all times, whether in transit or at rest. DynamoDB also supports VPC endpoints to keep traffic within the AWS network, further adding to security layers.Data Integrity: With support for ACID transactions, DynamoDB ensures data integrity. This means that your data maintains consistency, and operations either completely succeed or fail, ensuring there\'s no partial data.Threat Mitigation: DynamoDB has built-in features such as backup and restore capabilities, which help in mitigating potential data loss threats. It also offers point-in-time recovery, allowing you to restore your data to any second in the past 35 days, strengthening your strategy against data threats.All these advantages notwithstanding, integrating DynamoDB is not a cure-all. There are potential disadvantages, such as a steep initial learning curve, possible high costs for high-traffic applications, and limitations on item size and indexing. Further, DynamoDB might not be beneficial if your app relies heavily on complex transactions or has large binary objects as it requires data denormalization.So, integrating DynamoDB with your tech stack, while offering several advantages, should be a carefully considered decision based on your specific needs."},{"question":"As I endeavor to establish an Apache Kafka streaming infrastructure for my sophisticated software application, I\'m persistently encountering a \'TimeoutException\'. Could you elucidate the precise configuration of a Kafka producer and the streaming of intricate data sets? Additionally, could you expound on potential complications and their respective resolutions, necessitating a comprehensive, multi-tiered problem-solving approach?","answer":"Apache Kafka is a robust platform for building real-time streaming data pipelines. The Kafka producer is a client that publishes records to the Kafka cluster. Below are some important configurations for a Kafka producer.Some important configurations for a Kafka producer:1. `bootstrap.servers`: A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster.2. `key.serializer` and `value.serializer`: Class to use to serialize the keys and values of messages respectively. Kafka clients will convert any object you send into bytes.3. `acks`: The number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to receive before considering a request complete. Allows you to control durability.4. `batch.size`: The producer will attempt to batch records together into fewer requests whenever multiple records are being sent to the same partition5. `linger.ms`: The producer groups together any records that arrive in between request transmissions into a single batched request.6. `buffer.memory`: The total bytes of memory the producer can use to buffer records waiting to be sent to the server.Possible complications and resolutions:1. Producer Buffer Full: This could happen if the producer is sending messages faster than they can be delivered to the broker. One solution to this is to increase the buffer size.2. Invalid Topic: Kafka producer raises `InvalidTopicException` if the topic is not valid. Ensure the topic exists and is correctly spelled.3. Not Enough Replicas: The producer sends messages to the leader of the partition. If the number of insync replicas falls below `min.insync.replicas`, the producer raises `NotEnoughReplicasException`. Make sure enough brokers are online and able to host replicas.4. TimeoutException: If the broker fails to receive a heartbeat from a producer within the `session.timeout.ms` duration, it concludes the producer has crashed and will not accept publish requests from this producer. Check if the configured `session.timeout.ms` is sufficient.In dealing with Kafka complications, it is a good practice to set up monitoring platforms like `Confluent Control Center` or `Datadog` to understand how your Kafka producers and consumers are behaving in real-time, reduce troubleshooting time, and minimize downtime.Moreover, maintaining the latest stable version of Kafka can also help in avoiding possible complications since the Apache community constantly introduces bug fixes and performance improvements."},{"question":"How does one handle null values in Pandas for complex and large datasets with multiple datatypes? Can you write a function that will handle null values appropriately according to data type? Additionally, implement a method to report the percentage of null values for each column in the dataset.

For numerical columns (int64 and float64), median is probably the safest option since it\'s less sensitive to outliers. For object type (categorical) columns, filling in missing values with the most common category (mode) can be a pragmatic solution.Here\'s an example function that does this:```pythonimport pandas as pdimport numpy as npdef handle_null_values(df):    for column in df.columns:        if df[column].dtype == \'object\':  # Categorical data            df[column].fillna(df[column].mode()[0], inplace=True)        else:            df[column].fillna(df[column].median(), inplace=True)    return df```Usage of the function:```python# Assume df is your DataFramedf = handle_null_values(df)```For reporting the percentage of null values for each column in the dataset, you can use the following function:```pythondef report_null_values(df):    # Using dictionary comprehension, calculating percentage of null values for each column    report = {col: (np.sum(df[col].isnull()) / df.shape[0]) * 100 for col in df.columns}    return report```Usage of the function:```python# Assume df is your DataFramereport = report_null_values(df)for col, percent_null in report.items():    print(f\'Column \\"{col}\\" has {percent_null} % null values\')```These functions should be efficient enough for large datasets. However, remember that replacing null values with measures like median or mode is a simple form of imputation and may not always be the best strategy.

It works by iterating over a range from 0 to n-2, and for each iteration, it appends the sum of the last two elements in the list to the list. The \\"-1\\" and \\"-2\\" are used to index from the end of the list. The list initially contains the first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence `0,1`. The generated Fibonacci sequence will have `n` elements for the range `0 to n-1`.Note: This function will give `n` first numbers from the Fibonacci sequence, not the numbers up to `n`. To get numbers up to `n`, the while loop has to be implemented."},{"question":"Can we postulate that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Capsule Networks (CapsNet) both fall under the umbrella of deep learning models, yet distinguish themselves in the aspect that only CapsNet incorporates a dynamic routing mechanism, a feature absent in CNN?","answer":"Yes, that\'s correct. Both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Capsule Networks (CapsNet) are types of deep learning models, which are sub-sets of machine learning algorithms. CNNs excel in tasks such as image recognition, where there is strong spatial correlation among the input features.A primary difference between these two is indeed the presence of a dynamic routing mechanism in CapsNets. The advantage offered by this dynamic routing is a vastly improved ability to recognize hierarchical relationships between parts and wholes.A CNN can lose a lot of this hierarchical information due to its pooling layers, which aim to make the output invariant to small translations, but often result in the loss of precise spatial relationships between high-level and low-level features. CapsNets, on the other hand, preserve these relationships, meaning they can be a lot more sensitive to the precise spatial positioning of features."},{"question":"I am trying to find a quick and dirty way to estimate fugit for a basket of American options real time. Is there a quick way to provide a proxy? I know one can do binomial tree or monte carlos simulation, but that would just take too long to run for a large universe of options.Thank you!","answer":"Fugit represents the expected time to exercise an option and can be an important tool for options traders for risk management purposes. Unfortunately, there aren\'t many shortcuts for estimating fugit, as it often requires a complex computation as part of a larger options pricing model, such as the binomial model or a Monte Carlo simulation.However, you could possibly develop a proxy that simplifies computation and can be calculated more rapidly at the cost of some accuracy. Here are a few potential approaches:1. Delta approximation: Fugit is closely related to the rate at which an option\'s delta changes, so you could potentially use delta as a proxy. However, this would only be accurate for options that are near-the-money and have a significant amount of time until expiration.2. Black-Scholes approximation: The Black-Scholes model provides a relatively quick method for pricing options, and with some modification it could potentially be used to estimate fugit. However, this approach would ignore early exercise features present in American options which may lead to inaccuracies.3. Regression Model: You could develop a machine learning model that takes in features such as stock price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free rate , implied volatility and outputs an estimate for fugit. This would require a dataset of options with known fugit values to train on, and the accuracy would likely improve as the model is exposed to more data.Remember that these methods will likely be less accurate than using a proper options pricing model to calculate fugit directly, so use them carefully and sparingly. For critical risk management purposes it\'s probably best to bite the bullet and use a more accurate method, even if it\'s computationally intensive. It could be feasible to use the shortcuts for filtering or preliminary analysis, and then use a more accurate method for your final decision making."},{"question":"> For instance, many elements used in the objective function of alearning algorithm (such as the RBF kernel of Support Vector Machinesor the l1 and l2 regularizers of linear models) assume that allfeatures are centered around zero and have variance in the same order.This is from the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#preprocessing)Can someone please specify what elements they are referring when it is said the mean is expected to be zero.I understand that the variance should be in similar range for the algorithms to give same significance to each feature. But is there anything also necessarily expecting zero mean in the data?In other words, if I know variance of each feature is already in same range, can something still go wrong as it says some \\"elements\\" expect zero mean.","answer":"The \\"elements\\" referred to here are the features or variables in your data set. Each column of your data can be considered a feature. The phrase \\"expecting a mean of zero\\" refers to the concept of centering your data.Centering means subtracting the mean of a feature from every observation of that feature, so that new mean of the feature becomes 0. The reason for doing this could be mathematical convenience or a necessity for certain algorithms.Many machine learning algorithms perform better when the features are on similar scales. If a feature has mean significantly different from zero, it may dominate other features in the dataset and bias the model\'s predictions. Therefore, performing mean normalization (i.e., making mean zero) along with scaling (i.e., making variance same) usually gives more balanced and accurate outcomes.For example, in gradient descent optimization, a common strategy for training models, if the features have wildly different scales, then the feature with the largest scale might dominate the direction of the gradient, making the optimization process slow and inefficient.Another familiar example is the use of regularized linear models (like Lasso and Ridge) where the regularization term is a sum or square sum of all feature weights. If features are not centered, then ones with larger scales can potentially shrink more than they should because their magnitude (weight) is correspondingly larger too.However, it\'s also important to note that not all algorithms require features to be standardized. For example, tree-based models (like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Boosted Trees) do not require feature scaling at all. Also, some data types (like count data or binary indicators) should usually not be centered."},{"question":"Generate a programming script, taking into consideration the constructs of a singly-linked list, that inserts a specific element at a predetermined location within the list.

Find the node preceding the position where the new node should be inserted (in our example, we go to the 1st node to insert a new node at the 2nd position)2.

The application should be able to render SVG graphics correctly across different browsers and versions, including but not limited to Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer. Include error handling for unsupported browsers and versions.","answer":"This task involves a combination of multiple skill sets including frontend development, browser detection, SVG manipulation and error handling. Here\'s a conceptual approach to create this application.Please note that actual code creation and implementation would be a lot more complex and extensive process than this guide. 1. Front End Application:   A web application needs to be developed that serves as the front-end interface for the user. This can be developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript or with the help of front-end frameworks like React, Angular or Vue.js.2. Detection of Browser Type and Version:Everything that happens on your webpage is essentially ran through the user\'s browser. Therefore, their browser has an astonishing amount of information about the user. JavaScript is capable of pulling that information.```javascript    var isOpera = (!!window.opr && !!opr.addons) || !!window.opera || navigator.userAgent.indexOf(\' OPR/\') >= 0;    var isFirefox = typeof InstallTrigger !== \'undefined\';    var isSafari = /constructor/i.test(window.HTMLElement) || (function (p) { return p.toString() === \\"[object SafariRemoteNotification]\\"; })(!window[\'safari\'] || (typeof safari !== \'undefined\' && safari.pushNotification));    var isIE = false || !!document.documentMode;    var isEdge = !isIE && !!window.StyleMedia;    var isChrome = !!window.chrome && (!!window.chrome.webstore || !!window.chrome.runtime);    var isBlink = (isChrome || isOpera) && !!window.CSS;    var output = \'Detecting browsers by ducktyping:<hr>\';    output += \'isFirefox: \' + isFirefox + \'<br>\';    output += \'isChrome: \' + isChrome + \'<br>\';    output += \'isSafari: \' + isSafari + \'<br>\';    output += \'isOpera: \' + isOpera + \'<br>\';    output += \'isIE: \' + isIE + \'<br>\';    output += \'isEdge: \' + isEdge + \'<br>\';    output += \'isBlink: \' + isBlink + \'<br>\';    document.body.innerHTML = output;```This example is only for testing purposes. In actual development, this user agent information must be handled in a secure way to protect the user\'s privacy and information.3. Handling SVG Compatibility Issues:Based on the browser type and version some SVG graphics might not be rendered properly, hence a check needs to be coded into the application that checks for SVG compatibility and if not compatible, handle it by switching to an alternate way of representing the same data, like using HTML5 Canvas, PNG, JPEG, etc. Switching from SVG to HTML5 Canvas could be done with some libraries like Canvg.4. Error Handling:Error handling involves two parts. One is handling unsupported browsers gracefully. If a certain browser doesn\'t support SVG or has SVG compatibility issues, display a friendly message to the user explaining the situation.The second part is edge case error handling during SVG rendering. These errors occur when the SVG is being rendered on a compatible browser, but some part of the SVG code fails to execute. This can be done by wrapping SVG rendering code inside a try-catch block and displaying the specific error message to the user."},{"question":"Develop an Android application that accesses a REST API and displays the response in a ListView.

But I\'ll provide you some guidance and pseudo code on how to implement these features in your application.1. Pagination:In your REST API requests, you’ll need to include parameters specifying the page or limit and offset. After you get a response from the server, parse it and add the data to your adapter that handles the ListView.```javapublic void loadPage(int pageNumber) {    String url = \\"YourAPI/\\" + pageNumber;    //Send Get Request to API    //On Response --> Parse JSON and add items to ListView adapter}```Attach a listener to the ListView scroll event in order to load the next page once the user reaches the end of the list.2. Search functionality:This can be accomplished by adding a `SearchView` on top of the ListView. When a query is submitted, filter your adapter with the given string.3. Error Handling:You can use `try-catch` blocks around your network calls and handle each type of exceptions accordingly. Displaying a simple error message can be done by using Toasts, Dialogs, or Snackbars.4. Caching:Caching can be implemented using different mechanisms like Shared Preferences or SQLite database. ```java// Insert to cachevoid insertToCache(Data data) {    //insert data to your local DB}// Load from cacheData loadFromCache() {    //load your data from local DB}```5.

[7][8][9][10] Although the use of covalently bonded chiral side chains has been a quite robust strategy to form nonracemic helical main chain conformations, 11 the utilization of external chiral additives as sources of chirality is quite advantageous because it allows escaping from the tedious and costly synthesis of monomers containing chiral groups.</p><p>Chiral additives that interact with polymer chains through dynamic covalent bonds, 7 ionic interactions, 8 hydrogen bonding, 9 and host-guest interactions 10 have been used to shi the equilibrium between right-and le-handed helical conformations. Particular interest is currently focused on the utilization of weak nonbonding interactions such as dipole-dipole and dispersion interactions for the induction of single-handed screw-sense. 12 Even though the polymer has no specic receptor sites to interact with chiral additives, unfunctionalized chiral molecules including chiral hydrocarbons and haloalkanes allow inducing biased screw-sense to the polymer main chain. This induction mode is remarkable in that signicant screw-sense induction has been achieved despite the weak nondirectional molecular interactions. Macromolecular scaffolds allow amplifying such small energy differences per monomer units in large macromolecular scaffolds. 13 Through this mode of chirality induction, detection of \\"hidden\\" chirality of saturated hydrocarbons with quaternary stereocenters has been enabled. 3 Utilization of a chiral nonbonding interaction allowed us to induce single-handed screw-sense to virtually achiral poly(quinoxaline-2,3-diyl)s (PQX hereaer) using chiral solvents including limonene. 14,15 Application of these macromolecules as a chiral ligand in highly enantioselective asymmetric catalysis has been demonstrated as the rst example for the use of chiral solvent as a source of chirality in asymmetric catalysis. 16 In the system, the nonbonding interactions, including dispersion forces, between chiral solvent and the backbone of PQX may play a crucial role in determining the position of equilibrium between right-and le-handed helical conformations. Although the details of their molecular interaction await further clarication, the scope of chiral guests is important practically to nd more applications of this unique phenomenon. Particularly important is the utilization of naturally occurring chiral feedstocks as chiral additives and reduction of their loading amounts. In this paper, we screened natural amino acid derivatives as new chiral additives for induction of single-handed screw-sense, which leads to an asymmetric Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction in the presence of a virtually achiral macromolecular phosphine ligand along with a small amount of fully protected amino acids such as Ac-L-Pro-OMe.</p>Results and discussion<p>To test the ability of protected amino acids in screw-sense induction, circular dichroism (CD) spectra of PQX n-mer (PQX(n)) bearing n-propoxymethyl side chains in various achiral solvents with the protected amino acids were measured (Scheme 1). Firstly, CD spectra of PQX(100) in THF containing 16 enantiopure Boc-protected amino acid methyl esters were compared (amino acid/THF ¼ 10 : 90 (mol/mol)). All spectra showed the same CD signals with varied intensities and signs (see the ESI †). The signs and intensities of the CD signal (dissymmetry factor; g value) at 366-371 nm at 293 K are summarized in Table 1. For the sake of comparison, when used as a chiral additive in THF (11 mol%), (R)-limonene afforded g abs of 0.53 Â 10 À3 , which corresponds roughly to 20-25% screw-sense excess (se) (entry 0).</p><p>The proline derivative showed the most efficient induction, leading to the formation of le-handed (M) helix with se higher than 50% (entry 1). A six-membered ring derivative Boc-Pip-OMe (D-isomer) and L-Ala also showed efficient screw-sense induction to the same direction as L-Pro in terms of the relationship between the absolute conguration of the additives and the induced screw sense. Indeed, the observed screw-sense induction was signicantly higher than the induction by (R)limonene (entry 0). The majority of the L-and D-amino acid derivatives induced Mand P-helical conformation, respectively, with varied degrees of screw-sense induction (entries 1-12). However, four of the tested L-amino acids including the leucine and asparagine derivatives (entries 15 and 16) induced righthanded (P) helical conformation albeit with low screw sense excesses (entries 13-16). No clear relationship was found between the sense/degree of screw-sense induction and the structure of the amino acid derivatives.</p><p>We then evaluated the effect of protective groups of proline on the screw-sense induction (Table 2). In terms of the groups at the C-termini, protection with ester was found to be more effective than amide or acid functionality (entries 1-5). Among a series of esters, methyl esters showed the highest induction. In terms of N-protection, triuoroacetamide and acetamide showed a much more efficient induction of M-helical sense (entries 8 and 9, 80-85% se) than did the others.</p><p>We found a strong effect of solvent on the screw-sense induction to PQX(30) with TFAc-L-Pro-OMe (Fig. 1, red bars). In comparison to THF used in the above measurements, signicantly weaker induction was obtained in chloroform. By contrast, t-butyl methyl ether (MTBE) showed much more effective induction than did THF. This trend was maintained in the induction to PQX(30) with Ac-L-Pro-OMe (Fig. 1, blue bars). This result suggests that chloroform has a strong nonbonding Scheme 1 Two enantiomeric (P-and M-) conformations of achiral PQX, of which equilibrium is shifted by N-protected amino acid esters used as additives in an achiral solvent.     different polymerization degrees (n ¼ 30-400), which were selectively synthesized using living polymerization (Fig. 3). The plot of CD intensities against polymerization degrees showed that higher screw-sense induction was achieved with increase in polymerization degree. The curve tting according to Green\'s theory 13 brings about the energy difference between Mand Phelices per unit (DG h ) of 0.16 kJ mol À1 for Ac-L-Pro-OMe in MTBE (Table 3, entry 5). The DG h with Ac-L-Pro-OMe in MTBE is signicantly higher than that in pure limonene, even though the amino acid additives are used in a small quantity. Even the use of 0.25 mol% Ac-L-Pro-OMe in MTBE allows the induction of M-helix with 88% se to PQX(1000) (Fig. 4).</p><p>We then sought the possibility of application of the particular helix induction in asymmetric catalysis, by taking Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of naphthyl bromide 1 with naphthylboronic acid 2 as a model reaction (Scheme 2). 6b, 14,17,18 Achiral PQXphos (1000-mer) containing diphenylphosphino groups was used as a ligand. In advance, we conrmed that no product was obtained in the absence of PQXphos and that racemic coupling product was obtained in the absence of a chiral additive (Table 4, entries 1 and 2). Use of 10 mol% (R)-limonene as a chiral additive resulted in the formation of the coupling product 3 with 43% enantiomeric excess (ee) (entry 3). TFAc-L-Pro-OMe was then used as a chiral additive in THF (1 : 9 molar ratio) in asymmetric Suzuki-Miyaura coupling. We observed the formation of 3 with 92% ee, although the chemical yield was disappointingly low (entry 4). The use of achiral low-molecular weight phosphines such as BPDPP and QXphos in the presence of TFAc-L-Pro-OMe resulted in the formation of racemates with low chemical yields (entries 5 and 6). These results suggested that the chiral reaction space is not formed directly by the chiral additive through its coordination to palladium metal, but rather, created by screw-sense induction to the polymer backbone. The results also suggested that the added TFAc-L-Pro-OMe signicantly inhibited the coupling reactions. When we reduced the loading of the chiral additive in the reactions with PQXphos, the reaction yields were improved, but enantioselectivity decreased signicantly (entries 7-10). In MTBE, we observed even stronger inhibition of the reaction, even though the higher enantioselectivity was obtained (entry 11). We found that the degree of reaction inhibition was improved signicantly with use of Ac-L-Pro-OMe in MTBE, which afforded 3 in much better yield with 95% enantioselectivity (entry 12). By reducing the loading of the chiral additive to 1 mol% in MTBE, we obtained higher chemical yields without affecting the enantioselectivity signicantly (entries 13-15). The use of enantiomeric Ac-D-Pro-OMe as a chiral guest led to the formation of an enantiomeric TFAc-L-Pro-OMe ( 10 a Standard reaction conditions: PQXphos (30 mg, 1.0 mmol P) and [PdCl(p-allyl)] 2 (1.0 mmol Pd) were stirred in a solvent (0.50 mL) at 30 C for 1 h. Chiral additive was added to the mixture, which was stirred at 30 C for 24 h. The bromide 1 (0.025 mmol), the boronic acid 2 (0.050 mmol), K 3 PO 4 (0.075 mmol), and H 2 O (25 mL) were added, and the resultant mixture was stirred at 30 C for 72 h.</p><p>Scheme 2 Asymmetric Suzuki-Miyaura coupling in the presence of achiral phosphine ligands including PQXphos with chiral additives.</p><p>(S)-coupling product under the same reaction conditions (entry 16).</p><p>We tried to reduce the amount of chiral additives, keeping the concentration of chiral additive at 3 mol% in MTBE, but increasing the concentration of PQXphos in the helix induction step. In a 10-fold reaction scale, Ac-L-Pro-OMe (20 mg) and MTBE (0.50 mL, 3 : 97 molar ratio) were used in the equilibration step (Scheme 3). The amount of Ac-L-Pro-OMe corresponds to 0.5 equiv. of 1 and 0.13 equiv. of monomer units of PQXphos. Aer the removal of MTBE used in the equilibration, 1-propanol (5 mL) was added as a reaction solvent to the solid catalyst before starting the reaction. The heterogeneous reaction, in which the catalyst was hardly dissolved, afforded 3 with 90% ee in 67% yield. By contrast, when the reaction was carried out in MTBE without switching the solvent to 1-propanol, 3 was obtained with 68% ee (73% yield). These results suggested that homochiral M-helix sense was induced in the equilibration step at high concentration with a substoichiometric amount of Ac-L-Pro-OMe, and that the induced helix was maintained during the progress of the reaction in the solid state using 1-propanol as a reaction solvent.</p>Conclusions<p>We found that protected amino acids enable the screw-sense induction to virtually achiral poly(quinoxaline-2,3-diyl)s (PQX) that have no chiral group or receptor site. The induction power of proline derivatives such as Ac-Pro-OMe and TFAc-Pro-OMe were signicantly stronger than limonene, which previously showed the most powerful screw-sense induction among the chiral solvents. A signicant effect of achiral solvent was noted: ether solvents, particularly MTBE, resulted in better screw-sense induction than did halogenated solvents such as chloroform, probably because of weaker interaction with PQX. Upon using achiral PQXphos containing diphenylphosphino coordinating groups, asymmetric Suzuki-Miyaura coupling proceeded with high enantioselectivities with up to 95% ee in the presence of protected proline derivatives as a sole chiral source. For use in catalysis, Ac-Pro-OMe was found to be most effective, while TFAc-Pro-OMe signicantly retarded the catalysis. These results clearly demonstrate that nonbonding interaction between the chiral additives and dynamic helical polymer can serve as an effective driving force to shi the equilibrium of helical conformations, leading to highly enantioselective asymmetric catalysis.</p>","answer":"Chiral nonbonding interaction with N-protected amino acid methyl esters used as chiral additives in achiral solvents allows dynamic induction of single-handed helical conformation in poly(quinoxaline-2,3-diyl)s (PQX) bearing only achiral substituents. Ac-L-Pro-OMe, for instance, allows induction of energy preference of 0.16 kJ mol À1 per monomer unit for the M-helical structure over the P-helix in t-butyl methyl ether (MTBE). With this new mode of screw-sense induction, homochiral screw-sense has been induced in virtually achiral poly(quinoxaline-2,3-diyl)s 1000-mer containing phosphine pendants (PQXphos).

Several active analogues were also evaluated for their ability to block uptake of DA, 5-HT, and NE and inhibit binding of [(125)I] RTI-55 at HEK-hDAT, HEK-hSERT, and HEK-hNET cells. Mazindane (26) was found to be a pro-drug, oxidizing (5-H --> 5-OH) to mazindol on rat striatal membranes and HEK-hDAT cells. The 4\',7,8-trichloro analogue (38) of mazindol was the most potent and selective ligand for HEK-hDAT cells (DAT K(i) = 1.1 nM; SERT/DAT = 1283 and NET/DAT = 38). Experimental results strongly favor the cyclic or ol tautomers of 2 and 3 to bind more tightly at the DAT than the corresponding keto tautomers.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"5-OH\\", \\"4u0027,7,8-trichloro\\", \\"5-HT\\", \\"Mazindol\\", \\"benzo\\", \\"homomazindol\\", \\"NE\\", \\"alkyl\\", \\"aryl\\", \\"DA\\", \\"dopamine\\", \\"hydroxyl\\", \\"[(125)I] RTI-55\\", \\"Mazindane\\", \\"5-H\\", \\"mazindol\\", \\"methoxy\\", \\"cocaine\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"hSERT\\", \\"dopamine transporter\\", \\"DAT\\", \\"NET\\", \\"hNET\\", \\"hDAT\\", \\"SERT\\", \\"cocaine binding site\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

Our previous work, built on the early pioneering multikinase inhibitor LY294002, resulted in the only PI3K vascular-targeted PI3K inhibitor prodrug, SF1126, which has now completed Phase I clinical trials. This inhibitor has properties that impart more in vivo activity than should be warranted by its enzymatic potency, which in general is much lower than other clinical stage PI3K inhibitors. We embarked on the exploration of scaffolds that retained such properties while simultaneously exhibiting an increased potency toward PI3K. This work resulted in the discovery of the 5-morpholino-7H-thieno[3,2-b]pyran-7-one system as the foundation of a new compound class of potential PI3K inhibitors having improved potency toward PI3K.

Higher penetration level of renewables,2. Introduction (and rapidly increasing deployment) of storage devices, and3. Loads becoming active (by participating in demand response).This dynamic modern grid faces the challenge of strong fluctuations due to uncertainty.There is a critical need of gaining real time observability, control, and improving renewable generation forecast accuracy to enhance the resiliency and keep the operational costs sustainable.Independent system operators (ISOs) with higher renewable penetration on the grid have already been facing challenges with the uncertainties associated with short-term forecasting errors.In year 2016, California ISO doubled its frequency regulation service requirements (causing a sharp rise in the cost of requirements) to manage the recurring short-term forecasting errors in renewable generation BID0 .The Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) could achieve 5 billion savings per year by integrating wind and solar forecasts into unit commitment, according to the study conducted by Lew et al BID1 .Thus, it is clear that the increased grid penetration levels of solar with its inherent variability (a combination of intermittence, high-frequency and non-stationarity) poses problems with grid reliability and cost of operating the grid on various time-scales.For example, day-ahead solar forecast accuracy plays a significant role in the effectiveness of Unit Commitment (UC); very-short-term solar forecasts errors due to fluctuations caused by the passing clouds lead to sudden changes in PV plant outputs that can cause strain to the grid by inducing voltage-flickers and real-time balancing issues.Thus, solar power generation forecast becomes an area of paramount research, as the need for robust forecast for all timescales (weekly, day-ahead, hourly and intra-hour) is critical for effectively incorporating increasing amount of solar energy resources at a global level and contributing to the evolution of the smart grid.Moreover, improving the accuracy of solar forecast is one of the lowest cost methods of efficiently integrating solar energy into the grid.The rest of the paper is organized as follows.The literature is reviewed and the significant shortcomings of the current forecasting approaches are recognized in Section II.Section II further introduces the capabilities of the proposed unified architecture and the novel algorithm to fill in the gap between the need to improve the forecasting techniques and the existing approaches.Section III introduces the proposed unified architecture based on RNN and the training algorithms utilized for implementing the neural network.Exploratory data analysis, evaluation metric and structure of input data, and the proposed algorithm are presented in Section IV.Section V discusses the results and their interpretation.The paper is concluded with Section VI, which also identifies the future avenue of research in this method of solar forecasting..The algorithm is trained using the data for the year 2010 and 2011 from the SURFRAD observations sites in Boulder, CO; Desert Rock, NV; Fort Peck, MT; Sioux Falls, SD; Bondville, IL; Goodwin Creek, MS; and Penn State, PA.The test year for each respective site was chosen to be 2009 for the purpose of benchmarking against BID28 and other previously reported results in the literature.Results from the two methods proposed in this paper are presented below:Short-term solar forecasting is of great importance for optimizing the operational efficiencies of smart grids, as the uncertainties in the power systems are ever-increasing, spanning from the generation arena to the demand-side domain.A number of methods and applications have been developed for solar forecasting, with some level of predictive success.The main limitation of the approaches developed so far is their specificity with a given temporal and/or spatial resolution.For predictive analysis problems, the field of AI has become promising with the recent advances in optimization techniques, parallelism, and GPUs.AI (especially deep neural networks) thrives on data, and with decreasing cost of sensor and measurement equipment, plethora of solar data is getting available.Data availability is only going to keep increasing in the coming years.The proposed novel Unified Recurrent Neural Network Architecture harnesses the power of AI to form a high-fidelity solar forecasting engine.This architecture has the potential to be implemented as a complete forecasting system, which spans the entire spectrum of spatial and temporal horizons with a capability to take real-time data as input to produce multi-time-scale (intra-hour, hourly and day-ahead scales) predictions.In addition, the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional Machine Learning methods in terms of quality of the forecast and its low forward inference time makes it a robust real-time solar forecasting engine.Although a deeper neural network will have more capacity, we experimentally observed that it leads to high variance in the model and therefore a reduced generalization power for the particular problem dealt in this paper.The performance of the proposed method can be further improved in several ways including hyper-parameter tuning and architectural changes like the activation functions used or the type of layers.Extension of the proposed architecture with LSTM cells and intra-hour forecasting horizons are potential future research avenues in this domain.","answer":"This paper proposes a Unified Recurrent Neural Network Architecture for  short-term multi-time-horizon solar forecasting and validates the forecast performance gains over the previously reported methods"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

BACKGROUND: Allergic airway eosinophilia is suppressed by cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptor (CysLT1 receptor) antagonists in several species including humans and guinea-pigs, suggesting that CysLTs are directly or indirectly involved in induction of the response. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effect of CysLT antagonists (pranlukast and MCI-826) on antigen inhalation-induced eosinophilia in peripheral blood and lung, and on IL-5 activity in serum during late increase of airway resistance (late asthmatic response, LAR) in sensitized guinea-pigs. METHODS: Guinea-pigs inhaled ovalbumin (OVA) + Al (OH) 3 and OVA mists alternately for sensitization and challenge, respectively, once every 2 weeks. At the fifth challenge, the effects of CysLT antagonists and an anti-IL-5 antibody (TRFK-5) on the occurrence of LAR, and blood and lung eosinophilia, which appeared at 5 h after challenge, were examined. The time-course of IL-5 activity in the serum after the challenge was evaluated by measuring in vitro \'eosinophil survival prolongation activity\'. The influence of CysLT antagonists on IL-5 activity was assessed. RESULTS: CysLT antagonists and TRFK-5 completely abolished blood and lung eosinophilia. LAR was suppressed by both MCI-826 and TRFK-5 by 40-50%. Sera obtained from sensitized, challenged animals 3 h and 4 h after challenge induced an obvious prolongation of eosinophil survival. The activity of the sera was completely neutralized by prior exposure to TRFK-5, suggesting that it reflected IL-5 activity. Increased IL-5 activity in the serum was inhibited by both pranlukast and MCI-826 by over 90%. CONCLUSIONS: CysLTs produced after antigen provocation sequentially induced IL-5 production from some immune component cells via CysLT1 receptor activation. Thus, it is likely that CysLTs indirectly cause antigen-induced eosinophilia through IL-5 production.","answer":"[[\\"CysLTs\\", \\"ACTIVATOR\\", \\"CysLT1\\"], [\\"pranlukast\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"IL-5\\"], [\\"MCI-826\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"IL-5\\"], [\\"pranlukast\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"IL-5\\"], [\\"MCI-826\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"IL-5\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Except in life-threatening situations, avoid this combination. Furosemide should not be used concomitantly with ethacrynic acid because of the possibility of ototoxicity. Patients receiving high doses of salicylates concomitantly with furosemide, as in rheumatic disease, may experience salicylate toxicity at lower doses because of competitive renal excretory sites. Furosemide has a tendency to antagonize the skeletal muscle relaxing effect of tubocurarine and may potentiate the action of succinylcholine. Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics because they reduce lithiums renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Furosemide may add to or potentiate the therapeutic effect of other antihypertensive drugs. Potentiation occurs with ganglionic or peripheral adrenergic blocking drugs. Furosemide may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine. However, norepinephrine may still be used effectively. Tablets Simultaneous administration of sucralfate and furosemide tablets may reduce the natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of furosemide. Patients receiving both drugs should be observed closely to determine if the desired diuretic and/or antihypertensive effect of furosemide is achieved. The intake of furosemide and sucralfate should be separated by at least two hours. Tablets, Injection, and Oral Solution One study in six subjects demonstrated that the combination of furosemide and acetylsalicylic acid temporarily reduced creatinine clearance in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. There are case reports of patients who developed increased BUN, serum creatinine and serum potassium levels, and weight gain when furosemide was used in conjunction with NSAIDs. Literature reports indicate that coadministration of indomethacin may reduce the natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of furosemide in some patients by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.

However, the mechanisms by which motor memory traces develop during sleep remain controversial in humans, as this process has been mainly investigated indirectly by comparing pre- and post-sleep conditions. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography during sleep following motor sequence learning to investigate how newly-formed memory traces evolve dynamically over time. We provide direct evidence for transient reactivation followed by downscaling of functional connectivity in a cortically-dominant pattern formed during learning, as well as gradual reorganization of this representation toward a subcortically-dominant consolidated trace during non-rapid eye movement( NREM) sleep. Importantly, the putamen functional connectivity within the consolidated network during NREM sleep was related to overnight behavioral gains. Our results demonstrate that NREM sleep is necessary for two complementary processes: the restoration and reorganization of newly-learned information during sleep, which underlie human motor memory consolidation.Introduction:There is now ample evidence that sleep plays a crucial role in the consolidation of newly-acquired procedural memory, particularly for explicitly instructed sequential motor skills( Walker et al., 2002; Korman et al., 2003; Doyon and Benali, 2005; Korman et al., 2007; Debas et al., 2010). Several mechanistic hypotheses have also been proposed regarding the contribution of sleep in this memory process( see[Frankland and Bontempi, 2005; Rasch and Born, 2007; Tononi and Cirelli, 2014] for comprehensive reviews). Yet, the dynamic neural changes that drive motor memory consolidation during sleep still remain controversial( Frankland and Bontempi, 2005; Rasch and Born, 2013; Tononi and Cirelli, 2014). One pioneering sleep-dependent consolidation model, the trace reactivation hypothesis assumes that the repeated reactivation of a recently formed memory representation during sleep leads to a gradual strengthening of the learning-related connections, and thus to long-term storage of the memory trace( Rasch and Born, 2007, 2013). There is now mounting evidence in support of this hypothesis including the replay of hippocampal place cell firing( Skaggs and McNaughton, 1996; Lee and Wilson, 2002) in rodents, as well as human studies employing targeted memory reactivation paradigms using auditory or olfactory cues( Rasch et al., 2007; Cousins et al., 2014; Laventure et al., 2016), and neuroimaging studies showing the reactivation of learning-related brain regions during sleep or awake rest( Maquet et al., 2000; Rasch et al., 2007; Deuker et al., 2013; Staresina et al., 2013; Tambini and Davachi, 2013). Another model, built in part upon the trace reactivation, the systems consolidation hypothesis( Frankland and Bontempi, 2005; et al., 2005; Rasch and Born, 2013) proposes that sleep engages an active reorganization process that stabilizes the labile neural representation of a novel skill into a consolidated memory trace. For instance, a systematic transfer in memory representations from hippocampal to neocortical areas has been reported for non-procedural forms of memories( Frankland et al., 2004; Maviel et al., 2004; Frankland and Bontempi, 2005). On the other hand, a systemic shift from cortical( e. g., motor, parietal cortex) to subcortical regions( e. g., striatum) has been proposed to underlie the consolidation of procedural memory, and motor sequence learning in particular( Doyon and Benali, 2005; Yin et al., 2009; Debas et al., 2010; Kawai et al., 2015). Yet in humans, the systems consolidation model has only been inferred indirectly by comparing the effect of motor practice on offline gains in behavioral performance and changes in neural activity between the initial learning and retention sessions separated by either diurnal or nocturnal sleep( Walker et al., 2002; Fischer et al., 2005; Gais et al., 2007; Takashima et al., 2009; Debas et al., 2010). Thus, direct evidence in support of this hypothesis from human neuroimaging studies is lacking. Finally, an alternative and potentially complementary model, the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis( Tononi and Cirelli, 2003, 2006, 2014) proposes that local neuronal networks are potentiated and eventually become saturated during learning. In order for new information to be encoded the following day, sleep would be involved in the restoration of these local networks by downscaling the strength of synaptic connections( Tononi and Cirelli, 2003; Huber et al., 2004; Tononi and Cirelli, 2006). However, direct experimental evidence to support the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis in humans remains limited and controversial( Frank, 2012). It is thus unclear whether and how these different sleep-dependent mechanisms of memory consolidation may be reconciled and contribute to motor skill learning in humans. Here, for the first time, we used simultaneous EEG and fMRI in order to identify the relative contributions of the trace reactivation, systems consolidation, and synaptic homeostasis hypotheses to the consolidation of procedural memory in humans. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that the memory trace of motor sequence learning involves network-wide reactivation and further reorganization into a more stable representation during non-rapid eye movement( NREM) sleep periods.Discussion:Our findings demonstrate a gradual shift in motor memory representations following motor sequence learning; a transiently activated cortical trace is downscaled back to baseline levels and a subcortically-dominant and more interconnected trace, emerges during NREM sleep. These findings suggest that sleep supports both a homeostatic restoration of the memory trace potentiated during learning, and also actively reorganizes the memory trace at a systems-level. Specifically, our findings reveal that the ventrolateral putamen plays a central role in the emergence of the consolidated pattern during NREM sleep.","answer":"The idea that , while you sleep , you could be honing skills such as the ability to play a musical instrument may sound like science fiction . But studies have shown that sleep , in addition to being beneficial for physical and mental health , also enhances memories laid down during the day . The process by which the brain strengthens these memories is called consolidation , but exactly how this process works is unclear . Memories are thought to persist as altered connections between neurons , often referred to as memory traces . When we practice a skill , we activate the neurons encoding that skill over and over again , strengthening the connections between them . However , if this process were to continue unchecked , eventually the connections would become saturated and no further increases in strength could occur . One possible solution to this problem is that sleep enhances skill learning by downscaling connections across the brain as a whole , thereby freeing up capacity for further learning . Alternatively , sleep may reorganize an initially unstable memory trace into a more robust form with the potential to last a lifetime . To test these possibilities , Vahdat et al . asked healthy volunteers to practice a finger-tapping task while lying inside a brain scanner , and then to sleep inside that scanner for 2–3 hours . When the volunteers returned to the scanner the next morning and attempted the task again , they performed better than they had the previous night . Their brains also showed a different pattern of activity when performing the task after a night’s sleep . So what had happened overnight ? As the volunteers lay awake inside the scanner , their brains reactivated the memory trace formed during learning . However , as they entered a stage of non-dreaming sleep called non-REM sleep , this activity became weaker . At the same time , a new pattern of activity – the one that would dominate the scan the next morning – began to emerge . Whereas the post-learning activity was mainly in the brain’s outer layer , the cortex , the new pattern included other areas that are deeper within the brain . The activity of one deeper region in particular , the putamen , predicted how well the volunteers would perform the task the next day . Non-REM sleep thus strengthens memories via two complementary processes . It suppresses the initial memory trace formed during learning , and reorganizes the newly-learned information into a more stable state . These results might explain why people who are sleep-deprived often have impaired motor skills and memories . The findings also open up the possibility of enhancing newly learned skills by manipulating brain circuits during non-REM sleep ."},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

This modification forces the network to anticipate the reward of action sequences, which, as we show, improves the exploration leading to better convergence.Our proposal is simple, flexible, and can be easily incorporated into any Deep RL framework.We show the power of our scheme by consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art GA3C algorithm on several popular Atari Games.Basic reinforcement learning has an environment and an agent.The agent interacts with the environment by taking some actions and observing some states and rewards.At each time step t, the agent observes a state s t and performs an action a t based on a policy π(a t |s t ; θ).In return to the action, the environment provides a reward r t and the next state s t+1 .This process goes on until the agent reaches a terminal state.The learning goal is to find a policy that gives the best overall reward.The main challenges here are that the agent does not have information about the reward and the next state until the action is performed.Also, a certain action may yield low instant reward, but it may pave the way for a good reward in the future.Deep Reinforcement Learning BID6 has taken the success of deep supervised learning a step further.Prior work on reinforcement learning suffered from myopic handcrafted designs.The introduction of Deep Q-Learning Networks (DQN) was the major advancement in showing that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can approximate value and policy functions.By storing the agent\'s data in an experience replay memory, the data can be batched BID8 BID9 or randomly sampled BID4 BID12 from different time-steps and learning the deep network becomes a standard supervised learning task with several input-output pairs to train the parameters.As a consequence, several video games could be played by directly observing raw image pixels BID1 and demonstrating super-human performance on the ancient board game Go .Inorder to solve the problem of heavy computational requirements in training DQN, several followups have emerged leading to useful changes in training formulations and DNN architectures. Methodsthat increase parallelism while decreasing the computational cost and memory footprint were also proposed BID7 BID6 , which showed impressive performance.A breakthrough was shown in BID6 , where the authors propose a novel lightweight and parallel method called Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C). A3C achievesthe stateof-the-art results on many gaming tasks. When the properlearning rate is used, A3C learns to play an Atari game from raw screen inputs more quickly and efficiently than previous methods. In a remarkablefollowup to A3C, BID0 proposed a careful implementation of A3C on GPUs(called GA3C) and showed the A3C can accelerated significantly over GPUs, leading to the best publicly available Deep RL implementation, known till date.Slow Progress with Deep RL: However, even for very simple Atari games, existing methods take several hours to reach good performance. There is stilla major fundamental barrier in the current Deep RL algorithms, which is slow progress due to poor exploration. During the earlyphases, when the network is just initialized, the policy is nearly random. Thus, the initialexperience are primarily several random sequences of actions with very low rewards. Once, we observesequences which gives high rewards, the network starts to observe actions and associate them with positive rewards and starts learning. Unfortunately, findinga good sequence via network exploration can take a significantly long time, especially when the network is far from convergence and the taken actions are near random. The problem becomes moresevere if there are only very rare sequence of actions which gives high rewards, while most others give on low or zero rewards. The exploration can takea significantly long time to hit on those rare combinations of good moves.In this work, we show that there is an unusual, and surprising, opportunity of improving the convergence of deep reinforcement learning. In particular, we show thatinstead of learning to map the reward over a basic action space A for each state, we should force the network to anticipate the rewards over an enlarged action space A + = K k=1 A k which contains sequential actions like (a 1 , a 2 , ..., a k ). Our proposal is a strict generalizationof existing Deep RL framework where we allow to take a premeditated sequence of action at a given state s t , rather than only taking a single action and re-deciding the next action based on the outcome of the first action and so on. Thus the algorithm can pre-decide on asequence of actions, instead of just the next best action, if the anticipated reward of the sequence is good enough.Our experiments shows that by simply making the network anticipate the reward for a sequence of action, instead of just the next best actions, the network shows significantly better convergence behavior consistently. We even outperform the fastest known implementation, the GPU accelerated version of A3C (GA3C). The most exciting part is that that anticipation canbe naturally incorporated in any existing implementation, including Deep Q Network and A3C. We simply have to extend the action set to also includeextra sequences of actions and calculate rewards with them for training, which is quite straightforward.We propose a simple yet effective technique of adding anticipatory actions to the state-of-the-art GA3C method for reinforcement learning and achieve significant improvements in convergence and overall scores on several popular Atari-2600 games.We also identify issues that challenge the sustainability of our approach and propose simple workarounds to leverage most of the information from higher-order action space.There is scope for even higher order actions.However, the action space grows exponentially with the order of anticipation.Addressing large action space, therefore, remains a pressing concern for future work.We believe human behavior information will help us select the best higher order actions.","answer":"Anticipation improves convergence of deep reinforcement learning."},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

The tax rate should be applied to the annual income on a monthly basis. For an increased challenge, build a secure login method for the employee. This should include the creation of usernames and hashed passwords. Note that hashed passwords should be stored and not the plain text password.Implement the privacy measures necessary to ensure that only an employee (when logged in) can alter their address and income details. Unauthorized attempts to modify these details should prompt an error message.","answer":"Here\'s a simplified example using Python 3. In this example I use \'hashlib\' library to hash the passwords. Also, I use a simple login method for authentication. This code doesn\'t really implement any real security measures but it should give you an idea of how to start:```pythonimport hashlibclass Employee:    def __init__(self, full_name, residential_address, annual_income, username, password):        self.full_name = full_name        self.residential_address = residential_address        self.annual_income = annual_income        self.username = username        self.password = self.hash_password(password)        self.is_logged_in = False        self.tax_rate = 0.2    def hash_password(self, password):        return hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).hexdigest()    def login(self, username, password):        if self.username == username and self.password == self.hash_password(password):            self.is_logged_in = True            return \\"Logged In!\\"        return \\"Invalid Credentials!\\"    def check_login(self):        if not self.is_logged_in:            raise ValueError(\'Employee not logged in!\')    def change_address(self, new_address):        self.check_login()        self.residential_address = new_address    def change_annual_income(self, new_income):        self.check_login()        self.annual_income = new_income    def calculate_monthly_tax(self):        self.check_login()        monthly_income = self.annual_income / 12        return self.tax_rate * monthly_income    def change_tax_rate(self, new_rate):        self.check_login()        self.tax_rate = new_rate```In this implementation, `is_logged_in` flag is used to determine if the user is currently logged in. When a change is done to the address or income, the check_login() method is called to see if the user is authenticated, else an error message is thrown.You can use this class like:```pythonemployee = Employee(\'John Doe\', \'123 Main St\', 100000, \'jdoe\', \'mypassword\')print(employee.login(\'jdoe\', \'mypassword\'))  # Should print \\"Logged In!\\"print(employee.calculate_monthly_tax())  # Should print the monthly tax based on the tax rate and annual incomeemployee.change_address(\'456 Elm St\')  # Changes the addressemployee.change_annual_income(120000)  # Changes the annual incomeemployee.change_tax_rate(0.25)  # Changes the tax rate```This is a very basic implementation and you would want to expand on it to add more error checking, validation, and security features in a real-world application."},{"question":"Develop a function to calculate the product of all elements in an array.input_array = [4, 6, 3, 9, 5]","answer":"Here is a simple function in Python that uses the `reduce` function from the `functools` module to multiply all elements in a list:```pythonfrom functools import reduceimport operatordef product_of_elements(input_array):    return reduce(operator.mul, input_array, 1)input_array = [4, 6, 3, 9, 5]print(product_of_elements(input_array))```In this code, `reduce()` applies `operator.mul` to the elements of `input_array`, effectively reducing the list to a single output through the multiplication operation. The third argument (`1`) is the initializer and is used as the initial value in the reduction process. If the list is empty, this initializer value is returned.The output of this code will be `1620`, which is the product of all numbers in the array.In this function, if the input list is empty, the product returned will be `1` (due to the initializer used) as per the mathematical convention that the product of an empty set is the multiplicative identity (`1`).If this behaviour is not desirable (like in a situation where an empty input should probably raise an error or return `None` or `0`), you can modify the function accordingly."},{"question":"Develop a function to insert underscores between words ending with punctuation marks in a provided string.","answer":"Here\'s a simple python function for that.

An intact VSG coat protects the trypanosome from lysis by the alternative pathway of the complement system [1, 2]. However, VSGs are highly antigenic, and eventually the trypanosome succumbs to antibody-mediated lysis. The parasite therefore relies on its ability to switch between the mutually exclusive expression of one of hundreds of immunologically distinct VSGs to maintain a chronic infection [3].</p><p>VSGs have a highly conserved tertiary structure with an extremely diverse N-terminal \'variable\' domain containing two long antiparallel α-helices separated by a turn [4]. Insertion of epitope tags into various regions of VSG can result in drastic reductions in expression level, indicating stringent quality controls on these molecules before they reach the parasite surface [5]. A striking feature of VSGs is that regions of the molecule which are highly divergent (only 16% conservation in amino acid sequence), can nonetheless have very similar tertiary structures [4, 6]. The VSG gene family therefore appears to have evolved through a \\"tug of war\\" between two evolutionary selection pressures: one for antigenic diversity resulting in sequence divergence, and another for conservation of tertiary structure, which presumably facilitates packing of different VSGs within the coat of a switching trypanosome [7]. The VSG layer shields invariant proteins on the cell surface from recognition by antibodies. The VSG-fold (a conserved tertiary structure characteristic of VSG) can also be found in a variety of invariant surface molecules, presumably allowing a nondisruptive fit into the protective VSG layer [7-9].</p>The xe2x80x9cfluidxe2x80x9d VSG coat and immune evasion<p>The VSG coat is a highly fluid surface barrier, with rapid lateral diffusion of GPI-anchored VSG molecules within the coat [10]. There is no evidence for significant lateral protein-protein interactions between the VSG dimers, or for self-assembly of VSG dimers into larger two-dimensional assemblies [11]. Trypanosome clearance in immunised animals appears to be primarily mediated by a T-cell independent immunoglobulin M (IgM) response [12, 13]. It is likely that the specific nature of the VSG surface coat architecture, with its repetitive arrays of closely packed identical VSG homodimers plays a critical role in triggering T-cell independent B-cell responses [13, 14].</p><p>Although trypanosomes are very effectively lysed in the presence of anti-VSG IgG or IgM, they are unaffected by low antibody titres through their ability to remove anti-VSG antibodies from the cell surface through endocytosis [15]. Bloodstream form T. brucei has one of the highest rates of endocytosis measured, resulting in the complete turn-over of the entire pool of surface VSG every 12 minutes [16]. These extremely high rates of endocytosis could function as a \\"coat cleaning machine\\", stripping host molecules off of the trypanosome surface, and shunting complexes of VSG covalently bound to host molecules for degradation in the lysosome. This would make high rates of endocytosis a critical protective adaptation, increasing the pathogenicity of the bloodstream form trypanosome [17].</p>The link between Variant Surface Glycoprotein and the trypanosome cell cycle<p>In order to investigate the role of VSG and determine whether we could make \\"naked\\" bloodstream form trypanosomes, we performed VSG RNA interference (RNAi) in vitro [18]. Induction of RNAi against the active VSG results in very rapid ablation of VSG transcript within 4 hours. This triggers a rapid and specific cell-cycle arrest, whereby cells stall precytokinesis after completion of mitosis, but before initiation of a cleavage furrow. There is no evidence for reinitiation of S phase within these arrested cells. This phenotype is particularly striking in comparison with other precytokinesis blocks that have been described in bloodstream form T. brucei. The Mottram laboratory has inhibited T. brucei homologues of Mob1, which is required for cytokinesis in S. pombe [19]. After the induction of Mob1 RNAi in bloodstream form T. brucei, a delay in cytokinesis is observed. The majority of the cells have a detectable cleavage furrow, however there is an accumulation of cells with multiple nuclei indicating reinitiation of S phase. Similarly, inhibition of synthesis of GPI8, which is involved in addition of the preformed GPI anchor onto nascent polypeptides, results in a precytokinesis block [20]. However, these cells are only partially blocked within the cell cycle, as \\"monster\\" cells with multiple flagella and nuclei accumulate within the culture. The VSG RNAi induced arrest is the first precise precytokinesis arrest described in bloodstream form T. brucei. This argues that VSG transcript or protein is monitored during the cell-cycle, and that a specific checkpoint is triggered in the absence of either VSG synthesis or VSG on the cell surface.</p>Consequences of VSG restriction<p>Surprisingly, the total amount of VSG in these VSG RNAi stalled trypanosomes did not appear visibly decreased using immunofluorescence microscopy or Western blot analysis, even after a block in VSG synthesis for 24 hours [18]. VSG has an unusually long half-life (more than 33 +/− 9 hours), allowing stalled cells to persist in the absence of VSG synthesis [21]. Cells stalled after the induction of VSG RNAi for 24 hours were shorter and broader than normal, although there was no visible reduction in cell volume. This morphology could be a consequence of VSG restriction resulting in the cell attempting to minimise its surface area to volume ratio. The short and broad morphology is superficially similar to that of \\"stumpy\\" form parasites, which are nondividing forms arising at high parasite densities [22]. In these \\"stumpy\\" cells VSG synthesis has also ceased [23], suggesting that the \\"stumpy\\" morphology could be a consequence of VSG restriction.</p><p>Does this cell-cycle arrest triggered in the absence of VSG synthesis indeed have a protective function for the trypanosome? Induction of VSG RNAi in vivo leads to very rapid clearance, arguing that minor chinks might develop in the protective coat, which are exploited by an immunocompetent animal. This indicates the essentiality of a completely intact VSG coat for immune evasion. Although blocking cell division in the absence of VSG synthesis prevents drastic dilution of the VSG coat, this arrest is not adequate to protect the trypanosome in immunocompetent animals. Our experiments result in very rapid ablation of VSG transcript down to 1-2% normal levels within 8 hours. Possibly we have overwhelmed a putative protective mechanism, and the VSG \\"sensing\\" mechanism linking VSG synthesis to progression through the cell-cycle has evolved to absorb less drastic fluctuations in VSG synthesis.</p><p>Clearly, it will be important to determine what aspect of VSG or its synthesis is \\"monitored\\" in order to trigger the cell-cycle arrest. What processes have stopped in these arrested cells? Is there continued synthesis of GPI anchors? What exactly is the mechanism whereby these cells stalled by VSG RNAi are cleared in mice? The extreme sensitivity of trypanosomes to inhibition of VSG synthesis in vivo argues that chemicals that perturb VSG synthesis or processing would be promising lead drug candidates for trypanosomiasis.</p>","answer":"Summary The African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei has a precarious existence as an extracellular parasite of the mammalian bloodstream, where it is faced with continuous immune attack.

This task is to be accomplished by employing an array-oriented storage model to ensure optimal memory utilization, facilitating rapid data access, and ensuring optimal computational efficiency.","answer":"Here is a Python script that uses an array (Python list) to store and print out the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence:```python# Function to Generate Fibonacci sequencedef generate_fibonacci(n):    # Initializing array with starting Fibonacci numbers    fib = [0, 1]    # Generate the sequences    while len(fib) < n:        fib.append(fib[-1] + fib[-2])    return fib# Print the First 10 Fibonacci Numbersfirst_10_fibonacci = generate_fibonacci(10)print(first_10_fibonacci)```When you run this script, it outputs the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence:```python[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]```In this script, `generate_fibonacci(n)` function is used to generate the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. This function starts by initializing a list `fib` with the first two Fibonacci numbers `[0, 1]`. Then it enters a loop that continues until `fib` contains `n` numbers. Inside the loop, it calculates each new Fibonacci number as the sum of the previous two numbers, and adds it to the end of the list. This is the principle of the Fibonacci sequence. The function finally returns the list `fib` which contains the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The main body of the script then prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers."},{"question":"A sphere\'s surface area is given by 4π(R^2), where R is the radius of the sphere. A sphere\'s volume is given by 4/3π(R^3), where R is the radius of the sphere again. Develop a Python program \\"sphere_calculations\\" that:1. Contains a function, \\"calculate_sphere_area\\", which takes the radius as an argument and returns the surface area. If the input value is negative, the function should raise a ValueError with the message \\"The radius cannot be negative\\".2. Contains another function, \\"calculate_sphere_volume\\", which takes the radius as an argument and returns the volume. If the input value is negative, the function should raise a ValueError with the message \\"The radius cannot be negative\\".Additionally, your program should have a user interaction system that prompts for the radius and lets the user choose whether they want to calculate and display the surface area or volume. If the input is invalid (either the radius is negative or the chosen operation is not correct), appropriate error messages should be shown.","answer":"Here is a python script that does what you asked for:```pythonfrom math import pidef calculate_sphere_area(radius):    if radius < 0:        raise ValueError(\'The radius cannot be negative\')    return 4 * pi * radius2def calculate_sphere_volume(radius):    if radius < 0:        raise ValueError(\'The radius cannot be negative\')    return 4/3 * pi * radius3def sphere_calculations():    while True:        try:            radius = float(input(\'Enter the radius of the sphere: \'))            operation = input(\'Type \\"a\\" to calculate the surface area or \\"v\\" to calculate the volume: \')            if operation.lower() == \'a\':                result = calculate_sphere_area(radius)                print(f\'The surface area of the sphere is {result:.2f}\')                            elif operation.lower() == \'v\':                result = calculate_sphere_volume(radius)                print(f\'The volume of the sphere is {result:.2f}\')                            else:                print(\'Invalid operation choice.

If the radius is not a positive number, the ValueError will be caught and the error message will be printed out, asking for the input again. Same goes for the operation choice, if neither \'a\' nor \'v\' is inputted, an error message will appear and the user will be asked to enter the radius and operation again."},{"question":"Formulate a C language function that duplicates all the instances of a specified letter in a list datatype and reverses the altered list. For execution, utilise the list \\"Programming Language\\" with the selected character being \'a\', the insertion character being \'x\', and accounting for case sensitivity.","answer":"Sure, here is a simple solution implemented in C language.```c#include <stdio.h>#include <string.h>void duplicateAndReverse(char str[], char toBeDuplicated) {    char results[100]; // assuming that the maximum length will not exceed 100    int j = 0;    for (int i = strlen(str) - 1; i >= 0; i--) {        results[j++] = str[i];        if (str[i] == toBeDuplicated) {            results[j++] = \'x\';        }    }    results[j] = \'0\'; // null terminate the string    printf(\\"Result: %sn\\", results);}int main() {    char myList[] = \\"Programming Language\\";    char myChar = \'a\';    duplicateAndReverse(myList, myChar);    return 0;}```This code replaces every occurrence of the specified character in the string with the selected character and then reverse the string.

It is attempting to add a \'click\' event to a collection of HTML elements but failing to do so. Provide reasons for the failure.An interesting aspect also to note is, despite the code logic, the \'click\' event doesn\'t seem to trigger the expected alert message. You need to investigate it and come up with a solution to fix it.HTML:```html<html>  <body>    <button id=\\"submit\\">Submit</button>    <button id=\\"reset\\">Reset</button>  </body></html>```JavaScript:```javascriptfunction applyEventsToElements() {  var buttons = document.getElementsByTagName(\\"button\\");  for (var i=0; i < buttons.length; i++) {    buttons[i].onclick = function() {      document.getElementById(this.id).addEventListener(\\"click\\", function(){        alert(this.id + \\" button clicked!\\");      });    }  } }applyEventsToElements();```From this code snippet, identify potential issues and provide a solution to ensure each button successfully displays an alert with its respective id when clicked. The solution must scale for any number of buttons.","answer":"Issue:The main issue with this code is that it is attaching the click event listener inside another click event. This results in the click event listener not being attached until after the first click has occurred. So, the alert won\'t pop up until the button has been clicked twice.Moreover, using `this` inside the nested function refers to the global `window` object, not the button element. Therefore, `this.id` will be `undefined`.Solution:The solution is to attach the event listener directly to the buttons and not inside another click event. Use an arrow function to keep the correct reference to `this`.Updated JavaScript code:```javascriptfunction applyEventsToElements() {  var buttons = document.getElementsByTagName(\\"button\\");  for (var i=0; i < buttons.length; i++) {    buttons[i].addEventListener(\\"click\\", function(){      alert(this.id + \\" button clicked!\\");    });  } }applyEventsToElements();```This updated function will correctly add an event listener to each button element and display the respective alert when the button is clicked."},{"question":"Download this dataset: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml2/master/datasets/housing/housing.csv; Your task is to create a predictive model for the median house value considering all the given features.

But before that, we have to look at the missing data.```python# Examine missing valuesprint(data.isnull().sum())```In the feature `total_bedrooms` there are missing values which we need to handle. In this case, we will fill the missing values with the median of the column.```pythonfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputerimputer = SimpleImputer(strategy=\\"median\\")data_num = data.drop(\\"ocean_proximity\\", axis=1) # Necessity to remove non-numeric data for imputationimputer.fit(data_num) X = imputer.transform(data_num) # Transform it to DataFramedata_tr = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=data_num.columns,                          index=data.index)print(data_tr.isnull().sum()) # No Missing Value Now```However, there still is the categorical attribute `ocean_proximity`:```pythonfrom sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncodercat_encoder = OneHotEncoder()data_cat = data[[\\"ocean_proximity\\"]]data_cat_1hot = cat_encoder.fit_transform(data_cat)# Converting it to DataFramedf1 = pd.DataFrame(data_cat_1hot.toarray(), columns=cat_encoder.categories_)```Merging the numerical and categorical frames:```pythondata_final = pd.concat([data_tr, df1], axis=1)```We also need to look for outliers by visualizing the data:```pythonimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltdata_final.hist(bins=50, figsize=(20,15))plt.show()```This dataset does not appear to have clear outliers.Now, let\'s proceed with the modeling process:```pythonX = data_final.drop(\'median_house_value\', axis=1)y = data_final[\'median_house_value\']X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)model = LinearRegression()model.fit(X_train, y_train)```Finally, we calculate RMSE, MAPE, and R-squared values for the model:```pythonfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_percentage_error, r2_scorey_pred = model.predict(X_test)print(f\'Root Mean Squared Error: {np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))}\')print(f\'Mean Absolute Percentage Error: {mean_absolute_percentage_error(y_test, y_pred)*100}\')print(f\'R-Squared: {r2_score(y_test, y_pred)}\')```I used a linear regression model here because it\'s a good starting point for regression tasks. Based on the chosen metrics, we can iterate on the model selection and preprocessing steps to improve the model\'s performance.

It usually involves setting up a server-side language (like PHP, Node.js or Python) and a database. Here\'s a simplified steps:1. Install a server-side language: You will use a server-side language to process the data that is being sent from your website. Common languages include PHP, Node.js, Python etc. 2. Creating the Database: Depending on the data you need to store, you will need to create some tables in your database. Plenty of options available like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase, etc. 3. Configuring the Form: Your HTML form will need to have its method set to POST and its action set to the server-side file that will process the data.4. Processing the Form: In your server-side file, you will need to connect to the database and then retrieve the form\'s data from the _POST object.5. Inserting Data Into Database: The data retrieved from the form should then be inserted into your database.6. Retrieving the Data: Whenever you want to retrieve this data, you will do so through the server-side language and database retrieval methods.Since this involves code on server side, you must be careful to sanitize and validate form data to avoid injection attacks and handle user data securely.If you are using serverless architecture, you can also use third-party services like Google Forms or Formspree to handle form submissions without having to set up a server and database. However, the specifics depends a lot on the hardware and software stack you are using. It would be useful to learn some backend development, it would help in understanding how data flows from frontend to backend and is stored, retrieved and displayed."},{"question":"Examine attentively a CSS stylesheet to determine whether it includes the distinct selector rule,h1 { color: blue;}, while also investigating if this rule might influence other elements or trigger cascading effects in the HTML structure.","answer":"I can\'t interact directly with file systems or directly execute programs. However, I can certainly help you draft the Python script using the `cssutils` library that helps in parsing and manipulating CSS via Python.This script will load a CSS file, parse it, and search for a `h1` selector with `color: blue;` rule. It will not be able to determine if this rule might influence other elements or trigger cascading effects in the HTML structure, because understanding the overall impact of CSS rules would require knowledge of the specific HTML structure being styled. CSS impacts HTML elements based on their relationships defined in the HTML structure, which is not given in this case.Here is a rough script for your needs:```pythonimport cssutilsdef does_rule_exist(css_file_path, selector, property, value):    stylesheet = cssutils.parseFile(css_file_path)      for rule in stylesheet:        if rule.type == rule.STYLE_RULE:            if rule.selectorText == selector:                if rule.style.getProperty(property).value == value:                    return True    return False# Usage example:css_file_path = \'path_to_your_file.css\' selector = \'h1\'property = \'color\'value = \'blue\'if does_rule_exist(css_file_path, selector, property, value):    print(\\"Rule exists\\")else:    print(\\"Rule does not exist\\")```This code opens a CSS file at the provided location (`css_file_path`), goes through each rule in the stylesheet, and checks if there is a rule that matches the given selector, property, and value."},{"question":"Generate a deep learning model for language translation from English to French.","answer":"Designing a deep learning model for language translation from English to French consists of Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) models, which is a method of encoder-decoder based machine learning where the input and output are time-series data, applied for translating English to French. Here\'s a simple guide on how we implement this using Python and TensorFlow. 1. Preprocessing the Data:We begin by loading the data and introducing preprocessing methods. We need text cleaning (lowercase, remove punctuations etc.) and converting text data into sequences (tokenization).```pythonfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizerfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences# Tokenizationtokenizer = Tokenizer()tokenizer.fit_on_texts(data_source)data_source_seq = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(data_source)data_target_seq = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(data_target)# Padding data_source_seq = pad_sequences(data_source_seq, padding=\'post\')data_target_seq = pad_sequences(data_target_seq, padding=\'post\')```2. Building the Model:We utilize a common approach in Seq2Seq models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, along with an Embedding Layer.```pythonfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Modelfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, LSTM, Dense, Embeddingdef define_model(src_vocab, tar_vocab, src_timesteps, tar_timesteps, n_units):    model = Sequential()    model.add(Embedding(src_vocab, n_units, input_length=src_timesteps, mask_zero=True))    model.add(LSTM(n_units))    model.add(RepeatVector(tar_timesteps))    model.add(LSTM(n_units, return_sequences=True))    model.add(TimeDistributed(Dense(tar_vocab, activation=\'softmax\')))    return model```3. Compiling & Training The Model:Afterwards, we compile with an optimizer (RMSprop is commonly used for Seq2Seq), and a suitable loss function is Categorical Crossentropy. Training over several epochs is typical.```pythonmodel.compile(optimizer=\'rmsprop\', loss=\'sparse_categorical_crossentropy\')model.fit(data_source_seq, data_target_seq, epochs=50, batch_size=64)```4. Inference:For predicting on new English sentences we delegate the inference building to the encoder/decoder architecture.```pythonencoder_model = Model(encoder_inputs, encoder_states)decoder_state_input_h = Input(shape=(None,))decoder_state_input_c = Input(shape=(None,))decoder_states_inputs = [decoder_state_input_h, decoder_state_input_c]decoder_outputs, state_h, state_c = decoder_lstm(    decoder_inputs, initial_state=decoder_states_inputs)decoder_states = [state_h, state_c]decoder_outputs = decoder_dense(decoder_outputs)decoder_model = Model(    [decoder_inputs] + decoder_states_inputs,    [decoder_outputs] + decoder_states)return encoder_model, decoder_model```This gives you a basic run down on building, compiling, training and doing inference on a deep learning model for language translation. However, an exhaustive approach towards building such models might require a lot more fine-tuning and handling ambiguity in translations."},{"question":"I know that there is the possibility to use search pattern but I don\'t know how to implement this feature","answer":"In order to provide a helpful answer, we would need to know the context in which you are trying to implement a search pattern. Is this for a programming language, a database search, or some kind of software? Assuming you are talking about implementing a search pattern in a programming language like Python, Java, JavaScript, or SQL.Here is an example in Python, which uses regular expressions to find a specific pattern in the text:```python:import retext = \\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\\"# Find all words starting with \'t\' or \'T\'pattern = r\'b[Tt]w+\'matches = re.findall(pattern, text)print(matches)# [\'The\', \'the\']```This simple script uses a regular expression (the search pattern) to find all words that start with \'T\' or \'t\' in the given text.Here is an example using Javascript:```javascript:var text = \\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\\";// Find all words starting with \'t\' or \'T\'var pattern = /b[tT]w+/g;var matches = text.match(pattern);console.log(matches);// [\'The\', \'the\']```In SQL, pattern matching can be done using the LIKE operator along with wildcard characters (% or _) to search for a specified pattern in a column:```sql:SELECT column1, column2, ...FROM table_nameWHERE column1 LIKE pattern;```Example:```sql:SELECT * FROM CustomersWHERE Country LIKE \'s%\';```This SQL statement selects all customers whose Country starts with \\"s\\".Again, to provide a more accurate solution, it would be helpful to know the language or system you\'re implementing this in."},{"question":"Background:Question:NOTICERole: You are a professional engineer; the main goal is to write PEP8 compliant, elegant, modular, easy to read and maintain Python 3.9 code (but you can also use other programming language)ATTENTION: Use \'##\' to SPLIT SECTIONS, not \'#\'.

The charging port should be discreetly located at the base of the tail.## Anything UNCLEARThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approachWe will use the Python programming language to control the robotic cat. For the robotic movements, we will use the open-source library `pypot` which is designed for controlling multi-articulated robots with many degrees of freedom (like our robotic cat). For the interaction with humans, we will use the `SpeechRecognition` library for voice recognition and `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) for voice output. For the durability and maintenance, we will make sure to write clean and modular code, and use good practices for error handling and logging. We will also provide a comprehensive documentation for the users.## Python package name```python\\"robotic_cat\\"```## File list```python[    \\"main.py\\",    \\"cat.py\\",    \\"interaction.py\\",    \\"movement.py\\",    \\"maintenance.py\\"]```## Data structures and interface definitions```mermaidclassDiagram    class RoboticCat{        +str name        +bool is_on        +dict movements        +Interaction interaction        +Maintenance maintenance        +__init__(name: str)        +turn_on()        +turn_off()        +perform_movement(movement: str)        +interact_with_human()    }    class Interaction{        +str last_human_speech        +str last_cat_speech        +__init__()        +listen_to_human()        +speak_to_human(speech: str)    }    class Maintenance{        +bool is_broken        +str last_error        +__init__()        +check_status()        +repair()    }    RoboticCat \\"1\\" -- \\"1\\" Interaction: has    RoboticCat \\"1\\" -- \\"1\\" Maintenance: has```## Program call flow```mermaidsequenceDiagram    participant M as Main    participant C as RoboticCat    participant I as Interaction    participant Ma as Maintenance    M->>C: create cat    C->>M: cat created    M->>C: turn on cat    C->>M: cat turned on    M->>C: perform movement    C->>M: movement performed    M->>C: interact with human    C->>I: listen to human    I->>C: human speech recognized    C->>I: speak to human    I->>C: cat speech synthesized    M->>C: check status    C->>Ma: check status    Ma->>C: status checked    C->>M: status report```## Anything UNCLEARThe requirement is clear to me., Project Manager: ## Required Python third-party packages```python\\"\\"\\"pypot==3.1.1SpeechRecognition==3.8.1gTTS==2.2.2\\"\\"\\"```## Required Other language third-party packages```python\\"\\"\\"No third-party packages in other languages are required.\\"\\"\\"```## Full API spec```python\\"\\"\\"openapi: 3.0.0info:  title: Robotic Cat API  version: 1.0.0paths:  /cat:    post:      summary: Create a new robotic cat      requestBody:        required: true        content:          application/json:            schema:              type: object              properties:                name:                  type: string      responses:        \'201\':          description: Cat created  /cat/{name}/on:    put:      summary: Turn on the robotic cat      parameters:        - name: name          in: path          required: true          schema:            type: string      responses:        \'200\':          description: Cat turned on  /cat/{name}/movement:    post:      summary: Perform a movement      parameters:        - name: name          in: path          required: true          schema:            type: string      requestBody:        required: true        content:          application/json:            schema:              type: object              properties:                movement:                  type: string      responses:        \'200\':          description: Movement performed  /cat/{name}/interaction:    post:      summary: Interact with a human      parameters:        - name: name          in: path          required: true          schema:            type: string      responses:        \'200\':          description: Interaction performed  /cat/{name}/status:    get:      summary: Check the status of the robotic cat      parameters:        - name: name          in: path          required: true          schema:            type: string      responses:        \'200\':          description: Status checked\\"\\"\\"```## Logic Analysis```python[    (\\"main.py\\", \\"Contains the main entry point of the application.

In a similar way, sqrt{23} = [4; (1, 3, 1, 8)].It turns out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions for irrational numbers provide the best rational approximations. Let us consider the convergents for phi.begin{align}&amp;1 + dfrac{1}{1} = 2 &amp;1 + dfrac{1}{1 + dfrac{1}{1}} = dfrac{3}{2}&amp;1 + dfrac{1}{1 + dfrac{1}{1 + dfrac{1}{1}}} = dfrac{5}{3}&amp;1 + dfrac{1}{1 + dfrac{1}{1 + dfrac{1}{1 + dfrac{1}{1}}}} = dfrac{8}{5}end{align}Hence the sequence of the first ten convergents for phi are:1, 2, dfrac{3}{2}, dfrac{5}{3}, dfrac{8}{5}, dfrac{13}{8}, dfrac{21}{13}, dfrac{34}{21}, dfrac{55}{34}, dfrac{89}{55}, ...What is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant,e = [2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, ... , 1, 2k, 1, ...].The first ten terms in the sequence of convergents for e are:2, 3, dfrac{8}{3}, dfrac{11}{4}, dfrac{19}{7}, dfrac{87}{32}, dfrac{106}{39}, dfrac{193}{71}, dfrac{1264}{465}, dfrac{1457}{536}, ...The sum of digits in the numerator of the 10th convergent is 1 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 17.Find the sum of digits in the numerator of the 100th convergent of the continued fraction for phi.","answer":"The jth convergent of the continued fraction for phi is given by the fraction of the (j+1)th and jth terms of the Fibonacci sequence. This is because the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the two preceding terms, the exact operation performed in calculating the convergents of the continued fraction for phi.Therefore, to find the 100th convergent of the continued fraction for phi, we must find the 101st term of the Fibonacci sequence.We then sum up the digits of the number we have found.Here is the python code to calculate this:```pythondef fib(n):    a, b = 0, 1    for _ in range(n):        a, b = b, a + b    return adef digit_sum(n):    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))print(digit_sum(fib(101)))```This code first calculates the 101st term of the Fibonacci sequence using the `fib` function, then calculates the sum of its digits using the `digit_sum` function."},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

Among patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosed in the United States, 37.2% are diagnosed with stage III and 27.9% with stage II disease. In locoregionally advanced CRC, surgery is the primary treatment modality and has a curative intent. The survival depends on the pathologic stage and varies from 30%-60% for stage III to 60%-80% for stage II. However, as much as 40%-50% of patients will relapse and require additional treatment of the disease. Clinical failure after resection of CRC is predominantly secondary to the clinical progression of previously undetected distant metastatic disease. Until very recently, the absolute benefit for survival obtained with adjuvant therapy compared with control was about 6%. Introduction of oxaliplatin in the adjuvant setting has shown a reduction of 23% in the risk of relapse when compared with 5-fluorouracil alone (MOSAIC). Recent phase III studies have shown that targeted agents improved survival in patients with advanced-stage CRC. Bevacizumab , a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor , is the first antiangiogenic drug to show improved efficacy when used in combination with irinotecan and oxaliplatin for first- and second-line treatment of CRC . cetuximab, another monoclonal antibody targeting epidermal growth factor receptor, has shown efficacy in third-line therapy and promising results in first-line phase II studies. There is great interest in whether the biologic agents bevacizumab and cetuximab can improve survival in the adjuvant-therapy setting. This article reviews the adjuvant therapy for colon cancer and discusses the potential role and current trials involving the targeted agents.sentence: Bevacizumab , a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor , is the first antiangiogenic drug to show improved efficacy when used in combination with irinotecan and oxaliplatin for first- and second-line treatment of CRC .","answer":"[[\\"Bevacizumab\\", \\"irinotecan\\", \\"oxaliplatin\\", \\"POS\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

HAI (hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor) types 1 and 2 (HAI-1 and HAI-2 respectively) have been shown to inhibit the close homologue, i.e. matriptase. By co-expressing matriptase-2 and the inhibitor HAI-2 we have identified HAI-2 displaying high inhibitory potential against matriptase-2 at the cell surface as well as in conditioned medium. Accordingly, complex formation between matriptase-2 and HAI-2 was demonstrated by isolation of the complex via immobilizing either HAI-2 or matriptase-2 from lysates and conditioned medium of co-expressing cells. Furthermore, HAI-2 indirectly influences the expression of the hepcidin-encoding gene HAMP. The inhibitor abrogates the matriptase-2-mediated suppression of HAMP expression, presumably by inhibiting the supposed potential of matriptase-2 to cleave membrane-bound HJV (haemojuvelin). Taken together, the results of the present study have characterized HAI-2 as an inhibitor of matriptase-2 that modulates the synthesis of hepcidin and provides new insights into the regulatory mechanism of iron homoeostasis, with clinical importance for a treatment of iron overload diseases.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"iron\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"HAI-2\\", \\"Matriptase-2\\", \\"protease\\", \\"(hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor) types 1 and 2\\", \\"matriptase-2\\", \\"HAMP\\", \\"Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 2\\", \\"matriptase\\", \\"hepcidin\\", \\"HAI-1\\", \\"HAI\\"]}"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2018 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  The increasing amount of renewable energy sources in the energy system calls for new market approaches to price and distribute the volatile and decentralized generation. Local energy markets, on which consumers and prosumers can trade locally produced renewable generation directly within their community, balance generation and consumption locally in a decentralized approach. We present a comprehensive concept, market design and simulation of a local energy market between 100 residential households. Our approach is based on a distributed information and communication technology, i.e. a private blockchain, which underlines the decentralized nature of local energy markets. Thus, we provide energy prosumers and consumers with a decentralized market platform for trading local energy generation without the need of a central intermediary. Furthermore, we present a preliminary economic evaluation of the market mechanism and a research agenda for the technological evaluation of blockchain technology as the local energy market’s main information and communication technology. 2.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  We present an architecture for peer-to-peer energy markets which can guarantee that operational constraints are respected and payments are fairly rendered, without relying on a centralized utility or microgrid aggregator. We demonstrate how to address trust, security, and transparency issues by using blockchains and smart contracts, two emerging technologies which can facilitate decentralized coordination between non-trusting agents. While blockchains are receiving considerable interest as a platform for distributed computation and data management, this is the first work to examine their use to facilitate distributed optimization and control. Using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), we pose a decentralized optimal power flow (OPF) model for scheduling a mix of batteries, shapable loads, and deferrable loads on an electricity distribution network. The DERs perform local optimization steps, and a smart contract on the blockchain serves as the ADMM coordinator, allowing the validity and optimality of the solution to be verified. The optimal schedule is securely stored on the blockchain, and payments can be automatically, securely, and trustlessly rendered without requiring a microgrid operator. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  In recent years, more and more companies require dedicated software to increase the efficiency of their business. However, with rapidly changing technologies it is often inefficient to maintain a dedicated team of developers. On the other hand, outsourcing software development requires considerable effort and trust between involved parties to ensure the quality of the code and adequate payment. We present ChainSoft - a platform for outsourcing software development and automatic payments between parties that distrust each other, by means of blockchain technology. ChainSoft allows any developer to create software and submit software, includes automatic code verification and enforce users\' proper behavior. We implement our system using Ethereum Smart Contracts and Github/Travis CI and present first evaluation proving its security and low usage cost. 5. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB005):  In this paper, we investigate the use of decentralized blockchain mechanisms for delivering transparent, secure, reliable, and timely energy flexibility, under the form of adaptation of energy demand profiles of Distributed Energy Prosumers, to all the stakeholders involved in the flexibility markets (Distribution System Operators primarily, retailers, aggregators, etc.). In our approach, a blockchain based distributed ledger stores in a tamper proof manner the energy prosumption information collected from Internet of Things smart metering devices, while self-enforcing smart contracts programmatically define the expected energy flexibility at the level of each prosumer, the associated rewards or penalties, and the rules for balancing the energy demand with the energy production at grid level. Consensus based validation will be used for demand response programs validation and to activate the appropriate financial settlement for the flexibility providers. The approach was validated using a prototype implemented in an Ethereum platform using energy consumption and production traces of several buildings from literature data sets. The results show that our blockchain based distributed demand side management can be used for matching energy demand and production at smart grid level, the demand response signal being followed with high accuracy, while the amount of energy flexibility needed for convergence is reduced.Literature Review:","answer":"The original Bitcoin blockchain\'s primary utility is payment and digital asset exchange. Those functionalities are very popular in a large number of blockchain use cases. While basic form of blockchain payment does not require smart contracts, more sophisticated use cases for marketmaking applications may place access control for transaction parties, deploy specific market mechanisms, incorporate automated interaction with Oracles that will all benefit from various levels of smart contracts. For example, smart contracts can be used to implement a software development service trading market providing full functionalities including posting project requirements, submitting solutions, interacting with external Oracle for quality checking, and making payments BIB005 . Smart contracts can also enable a delivery service ordering system operated by autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle agents BIB001 . In peer-to-peer energy trading markets, smart contracts can be used to implement double auction market mechanism BIB002 , enable automatic negotiation, settlement and payments BIB003 , facilitate power flow estimation, optimization and control BIB004 , BIB006 ."},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of [\'DOWNREGULATOR\', \'SUBSTRATE\', \'INDIRECT-REGULATOR\', \'PART-OF\', \'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR\', \'REGULATOR\', \'INHIBITOR\', \'COFACTOR\', \'UPREGULATOR\', \'ACTIVATOR\', \'ANTAGONIST\', \'NOT\', \'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\', \'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF\', \'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR\', \'AGONIST\', \'PRODUCT-OF\', \'MODULATOR\', \'DIRECT-REGULATOR\', \'UNDEFINED\', \'AGONIST-INHIBITOR\', \'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR\', \'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR\'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

The bioaccumulation of saxitoxins (STX) in the trophic chain, mainly in freshwater, are not completely known. This work aimed to elucidate the effects of STX on Hoplias malabaricus through trophic bioassay. The fish were fed once every five days with Astyanax sp. before being subjected to an intraperitoneal inoculation with the lysate of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii culture containing 97% STX and 3% by neosaxitoxin and gonyautoxin during 20 days. The animal \'s liver was assessed using biomarkers as activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipoperoxidation (LPO) and protein carbonylation (PCO). In the blood was analyzed the genotoxic and hematological parameters. The hepatosomatic index and the relative condition factor did not show a significant difference between the exposed and control groups. The values of mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and mean corpuscular hemoglobin increased in the STX group. The hepatic tissue from both groups exhibited a typical pattern that have been already described for most teleost fish. The results suggested the generation of reactive oxygen species, with increased activity of GPx and concentrations of LPO and GSH; whereas the specific activity of SOD decreased. However, no changes were observed in the CAT, PCO, and DNA damage. Although the STX effects are known as neurotoxic, this cyanotoxin caused liver biochemical alterations that can be considered ecologically relevant.","answer":"[[\\"STX\\", \\"INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR\\", \\"hemoglobin\\"]]"},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

Inadequate maternal nutrition during gestation may cause an adverse environment for the fetus leading to alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) and sympatho-adrenomedullary ( SAM ) systems later in life . In the present study , we investigated the effects of diets with low and high protein : carbohydrate ratios on cortisol concentrations of pregnant gilts as well as the long-term effects on the function of the HPA and SAM axes in their offspring . Throughout gestation , 33 German Landrace gilts were fed high ( HP , 30 % ) , low ( LP , 6.5 % ) , or adequate ( AP , 12.1 % ) protein diets , which were made isocaloric by adjusting the carbohydrate content . The salivary cortisol concentrations of the sows were measured in the course of the gestation period . The offspring were cross-fostered , and the plasma cortisol and catecholamine concentrations of the offspring were determined on postnatal d ( PND ) 1 and 27 and under specific challenging conditions : after weaning ( PND 29 ) and after ACTH and insulin challenges ( PND 68 and 70 , respectively ) . Glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) binding and neurotransmitter concentrations were measured in stress-related brain regions , and histological analyses of the adrenal were performed . Maternal salivary cortisol concentrations increased throughout gestation ( P < 0.001 ) and the LP gilts had greater salivary cortisol compared with the AP and HP gilts ( P < 0.05 ) . No differences between diets were found for cortisol , corticosteroid-binding globulin , and catecholamine concentrations in plasma and for GR binding in hippocampus and hypothalamus in piglets at PND 1 and 27 . However , the cortisol response to weaning was increased in LP piglets ( P < 0.05 ) , and in HP offspring the basal plasma noradrenaline concentrations were increased ( P < 0.05 ) . The cortisol response to the ACTH and the insulin challenge did not differ between diets . On PND 81 , an increased adrenal medulla area was observed in LP offspring compared with the AP offspring ( P < 0.05 ) . Our results show that maternal diets with aberrant protein : carbohydrate ratios during gestation have moderate long-term effects on the function of the HPA and SAM system in the offspring , which indicates that pigs show a considerable plasticity to cope with maternal malnutrition .","answer":"{\\"Intervention\\": [\\"carbohydrate ratios during gestation\\", \\"high ( HP , 30 % ) , low ( LP , 6.5 % ) , or adequate ( AP , 12.1 % ) protein diets\\", \\"diets with low and high protein : carbohydrate\\", \\"maternal diets with aberrant protein\\"], \\"Outcome\\": [\\"cortisol concentrations\\", \\"aberrant protein : carbohydrate ratios\\", \\"protein : carbohydrate ratios\\", \\"cortisol response to weaning\\", \\"maternal cortisol concentrations\\", \\"adrenal medulla area\\", \\"Glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) binding and neurotransmitter concentrations\\", \\"Maternal salivary cortisol concentrations\\", \\"function of the HPA and SAM system\\", \\"salivary cortisol\\", \\"basal plasma noradrenaline concentrations\\", \\"adrenocortical and sympathoadrenal reactivity\\", \\"cortisol response to the ACTH and the insulin challenge\\", \\"plasma cortisol and catecholamine concentrations\\", \\"HPA and SAM axes\\"], \\"Participant\\": [\\"33 German Landrace gilts\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

In this algorithm, we first find a vector representation for the labels of the data points based on their local positions in the space. Then, we map the data to lower-dimensional space using a linear transformation such that the dependency between the transformed data and the assigned labels is maximized. In fact, we try to find a mapping that is as discriminative as possible. The approach will use Hilber-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) as the dependence measure. We also present a kernelized version of the algorithm, which allows non-linear transformations and provides more flexibility in finding the appropriate mapping. Use of unlabeled data for learning new representation is not always beneficial and there is no algorithm that can deterministically guarantee the improvement of the performance by exploiting unlabeled data. Therefore, we also propose a bound on the performance of the algorithm, which can be used to determine the effectiveness of using the unlabeled data in the algorithm. We demonstrate the ability of the algorithm in finding the transformation using both toy examples and real-world datasets.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: This paper analyzes the performance of semi-supervised learning of mixture models. We show that unlabeled data can lead to an increase in classification error even in situations where additional labeled data would decrease classification error. We present a mathematical analysis of this \\"degradation\\" phenomenon and show that it is due to the fact that bias may be adversely affected by unlabeled data. We discuss the impact of these theoretical results to practical situations.","answer":"However, an important point in semi-supervised learning is that there exists no guarantee that the use of unlabeled data will help us to achieve a better representation of the data. In an excellent work by Cozman et. al [1] , the important question \\"Do Unlabeled Data Improve or Degrade Classification Performance?\\" was addressed and it was shown that, not only unlabeled data can be useless in learning a new representation, but also it can degrade the performance of the algorithm in many cases. To reduce the likelihood of having destructive unlabeled samples, there is a set of assumptions about the structure of the underlying distribution of data, including smoothness assumption, clustering assumption, and manifold assumption, that researchers usually make one of them."},{"question":"You will be shown sections from a scientific research paper, together with a question about the paper.

One of its useful features is the \\"similar articles\\" section, allowing the end-user to find scientific articles linked to the consulted document in term of context. The aim of this study is to analyze whether it is possible to replace the statistic model PubMed Related Articles (pmra) with a document embedding method. Doc2Vec algorithm was used to train models allowing to vectorize documents. Six of its parameters were optimised by following a grid-search strategy to train more than 1,900 models. Parameters combination leading to the best accuracy was used to train models on abstracts from the PubMed database. Four evaluations tasks were defined to determine what does or does not influence the proximity between documents for both Doc2Vec and pmra. The two different Doc2Vec architectures have different abilities to link documents about a common context. The terminological indexing, words and stems contents of linked documents are highly similar between pmra and Doc2Vec PV-DBOW architecture. These algorithms are also more likely to bring closer documents having a similar size. In contrary, the manual evaluation shows much better results for the pmra algorithm. While the pmra algorithm links documents by explicitly using terminological indexing in its formula, Doc2Vec does not need a prior indexing. It can infer relations between documents sharing a similar indexing, without any knowledge about them, particularly regarding the PV-DBOW architecture. In contrary, the human evaluation, without any clear agreement between evaluators, implies future studies to better understand this difference between PV-DBOW and pmra algorithm.Background ::: PubMedPubMed is the largest database of bio-medical articles worldwide with more than 29,000,000 freely available abstracts. Each article is identified by an unique PubMed IDentifier (PMID) and is indexed with the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terminology. In order to facilitate the Information Retrieval (IR) process for the end-user, PubMed launched in 2007 a service of related articles search, available both through its Graphical User Interface (GUI) and its Application Programming Interface (API). Regarding the GUI, while the user is reading a publication, a panel presents title of articles that may be linked to the current reading. For the API, the user must query eLink with a given PMID BIBREF0. The output will be a list of others PMIDs, each associated with the similarity score computed by the pmra (pubmed related article) model BIBREF1.Background ::: Related WorkDoc2Vec has been used for many cases of similar document retrieval. In 2016, Lee et al. used D2V to clusterize positive and negative sentiments with an accuracy of 76.4% BIBREF4. The same year, Lau and Baldwin showed that D2V provides a robust representation of documents, estimated with two tasks: document similarity to retrieve 12 different classes and sentences similarity scoring BIBREF5. Recently, studies started to use documents embedding on the PubMed corpus. In 2017, Gargiulo et al. used a combination of words vectors coming from the abstract to bring closer similar documents from Pubmed BIBREF6. Same year, Wang and Koopman used the PubMed database to compare D2V and their own document embedding method BIBREF7. Their designed accuracy measurement task was consisting in retrieving documents having a small cosine distance with the embedding of a query. Recently, Chen et al. released BioSentVec, a set of sentence vectors created from PubMed with the algorithm sent2vec BIBREF8, BIBREF9. However, their evaluation task was based on public sentences similarity datasets, when the goal here is to embed entire abstracts as vectors and to use them to search for similar articles versus the pmra model. In 2008, the related articles feature of PubMed has been compared (using a manual evaluation) with one that uses both a TF-IDF BIBREF10 representation of the documents and Lin’s distance BIBREF11 to compare their MeSH terms BIBREF12. Thus, no study was designed so far to compare documents embedding and the pmra algorithm. The objectives of this study were to measure the ability of these two models to infer the similarity between documents from PubMed and to search what impacts the most this proximity. To do so, different evaluation tasks were defined to cover a wide range of aspects of document analogy, from their context to their morphological similarities.Methods ::: OptimisationAmong all available parameters to tune the D2V algorithm released by Gensim, six of them were selected for optimisation BIBREF14. The window_size parameter affects the size of the sliding window used to parse texts. The alpha parameter represents the learning rate of the network. The sample setting allows the model to reduce the importance given to high-frequency words. The dm parameter defines the training used architecture (PV-DM or PV-DBOW). The hs option defines whether hierarchical softmax or negative sampling is used during the training. Finally, the vector_size parameter affects the number of dimensions composing the resulting vector.A list of possible values was defined for each of these six parameters. The full amount of possible combinations of these parameters were sent to slave nodes on a cluster, each node training a D2V model with a unique combination of parameters on 85% of 100,000 documents randomly selected from the corpus. Every article from the remaining 15% were then sent to each trained model and queried for the top-ten closest articles. For each model, a final accuracy score represented by the average of common MeSH terms percentage between each document D_{i} from the 15,000 extracted texts and their returning top-ten closest documents was calculated. The combination of parameters with the highest score was kept for both PV-DBOW and PV-DM.Methods ::: TrainingThe final models were trained on a server powered by four XEON E7 (144 threads) and 1To of RAM. Among the total corpus (16,048,372 documents), 1% (160,482) was extracted as a test set (named TeS) and was discarded from the training. The final models were trained on 15,887,890 documents representing the training set called TrS.Methods ::: Evaluation ::: String lengthTo assess whether a similar length could lead to convergence of two documents, the size of the query document D_{x} has been compared with the top-close document C_{x} for 10,000 document randomly selected from the TeS after some pre-processing steps (stopwords and spaces were removed from both documents).Results ::: Evaluation ::: String lengthBy looking at the length difference in term of characters between documents brought closer by D2V, a difference is visible between the two architectures (Figure FIGREF19C). In fact, while a very low correlation is visible under the PV-DM architecture (coefficient -2.6e10^{-5}) and under the pmra model (-5.4e10^{-5}), a stronger negative one is observed between the cosine distance computed by the PV-DBOW for two documents and their difference in terms of length (coefficient -1.1e10^{-4}). This correlation suggests that two documents having a similar size are more likely to be closer in the vectorial space created by the PV-DBOW (cosine distance closer to 1).Results ::: Evaluation ::: Words co-occurrencesOnce scores from pmra have been normalized, the correlation between words co-occurrences and scores returned by both D2V and pmra were studied (Figure FIGREF19B). The very low slopes of the D2V trend lines (-1.1e10^{-5} for the PV-DBOW and -3e10^{-6} for PV-DM) indicate that the vocabulary content does not influence (positively or negatively) the proximity between two documents for this algorithm. By looking at the green dots or line, the pmra seems to give less importance to the co-occurrence of terms. A low slope is observed (-5.8e10^{-5}), indicating a slight negative correlation between word co-occurrence and computed score.Results ::: Evaluation ::: Stems co-occurrencesThis test assigns a score reflecting the proximity between two documents regarding their vocabulary content, the impact of the conjugation, plural forms, etc was lowered by a stemming step. The D2V model returns a cosine score S for a pair of documents (0 < S < 1, the top-close document is not likely to have a negative cosine value), while the pmra returns a score between 18M and 75M in our case BIBREF0. These scores were normalized to fit between the same limits than the cosine distance. For PV-DBOW, PV-DM and pmra, the influence of the stems is almost insignificant with very flat slopes looking at the trend lines (1e10^{-6}, -2e10^{-6} and -2e10^{-6} respectively, see figure FIGREF19A). This indicates that the stem content of two documents will not affect (negatively or positively) their proximity for these models.Results ::: Evaluation ::: Manual evaluationRegarding the results obtained by both PV-DBOW and PV-DM sub-architectures, the PV-DBOW model has been used versus the pmra. Its close score in the MeSH evaluation task compared to the pmra\'s one indicates an ability to bring closer documents sharing same concepts. Thus, 10 randomly chosen documents were sent to the pmra and to the PV-DBOW models and they were asked to output the 10 closest documents for each. Their relevance was then assessed by four evaluators.The agreement between all evaluators regarding the three-modalities scale was assessed by computing the Cohen\'s kappa score K thanks to the SKlearn Python\'s library (Figure FIGREF25) BIBREF16. First, we can notice that the highest K was obtained by the two medical data librarian (EL and GK) with K=0.61, indicating a substantial agreement BIBREF17. In contrary, the lowest K was computed using evaluations from the two Medical Doctors (SJD and JPL) with K=0.49, indicating barely a moderate agreement. The average agreement is represented by K=0.55, indicating a moderate global agreement.Regarding the ranking of all results (the first being the most accurate compared to the query, the last the worst one), the agreement can also be seen as moderate. The concordance rate has been defined between two evaluators for a given pair of results A/B as the probability for A to be better ranked than B for both judges. For each couple of evaluators the mean agreement was computed by averaging ten pairs result/query randomly selected. In order to evaluate the 95% bilateral confidence interval associated with the average concordance rate of each pair of judges the Student confidence interval estimation method has been used. Deviation from normal has been reduced by hyperbolic arc-tangent transformation. The global mean concordance by pooling all judges together was 0.751 (sd = 0.08). The minimal concordance was equal to 0.73 and the maximal one to 0.88.Regarding the evaluation itself, based on the three-modality scale (bad, partial or full relevance), models are clearly not equivalents (Figure FIGREF26). The D2V model has been rated 80 times as \\"bad relevance\\" while the pmra returned only 24 times badly relevant documents. By looking at the results ranking, the mean position for D2V was 14.09 (ranging from 13.98 for JPL to 14.20 for EL). Regarding the pmra, this average position was equal to 6.89 (ranging from 6.47 for EL to 7.23 for SJD).Figure 3. Study of both pmra and D2V models regarding their ability to bring closer documents sharing many MeSH labels. A (upper panel): frequency of the different MeSH scores for the pmra, PV-DM and PV-DBOW models. PV-DBOW and pmra are centred on the same value and have a similar distribution, indicating a common ability to link documents regarding their topic. However, the PV-DM algorithm looks less efficient. B (lower panel): correlation between MeSH scores calculated from the pmra and those from D2V. The slopes of the trend lines support the precedent result with a slope close to 1 for PV-DBOW while the PV-DM only reach 0.1, indicating a weaker correlation.

Lipid metabolic disorders are widely considered to be one of the most critical and basic link in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to illustrate the alleviation function of resveratrol (Res) on NAFLD and the roles of hepatic fatty acid synthase (FAS), low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr), scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), and thyroid hormone receptor β1 (TRβ1), which are the key molecules involved in lipid metabolism. Adult male Wistar rats were fed a normal diet or high fat/sucrose diet (HFS) with or without resveratrol for 13 weeks. HFS induced NAFLD formation and increased the lipids concentrations in serum and livers of rats, while noticeable improvement has been reached by Res intervention. Moreover, Res protected against HFS-induced decrease in hepatic LDLr and SR-BI mRNA and protein expressions, whereas TRβ1 expressions were impervious with/without Res. Unexpectedly, hepatic FAS gene expressions were markedly diminished in NAFLD rats and were gradually increased by treatment with Res. These data indicate that the alleviative effects of Res on NAFLD are associated with up regulation of hepatic LDLr and SR-BI gene expressions, which provide new insights into the pharmacological targets of Res in the prevention of NAFLD.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"Res\\", \\"resveratrol\\", \\"fatty acid\\", \\"sucrose\\"]}"},{"question":"Provide an optimized solution to calculate the cumulative count of elements in a nested multidimensional array structure.

The description is as follows: You are given an array `A` of strings.A move onto `S` consists of swapping any two even indexed characters of `S`, or any two odd indexed characters of `S`.Two strings `S` and `T` are special-equivalent if after any number of moves onto `S`, `S == T`.For example, `S = \\"zzxy\\"` and `T = \\"xyzz\\"` are special-equivalent because we may make the moves `\\"zzxy\\" -> \\"xzzy\\" -> \\"xyzz\\"` that swap `S[0]` and `S[2]`, then `S[1]` and `S[3]`.Now, a group of special-equivalent strings from `A` is a non-empty subset of `A` such that:Every pair of strings in the group are special equivalent, and;The group is the largest size possible (ie., there isn\'t a string `S` not in the group such that `S` is special equivalent to every string in the group)Return the number of groups of special-equivalent strings from `A`.Additionally, you are given a string `B` and you need to find out if `B` can be made special equivalent to any string in `A` by making any number of moves. If yes, return the group of special-equivalent strings that `B` belongs to, else return an empty array.Example 1:Input: `A` = [\\"abcd\\",\\"cdab\\",\\"cbad\\",\\"xyzz\\",\\"zzxy\\",\\"zzyx\\"], `B` = \\"badc\\"Output: [\\"abcd\\", \\"cdab\\", \\"cbad\\"]Explanation: One group is [\\"abcd\\", \\"cdab\\", \\"cbad\\"], since they are all pairwise special equivalent, and none of the other strings are all pairwise special equivalent to these. The string `B` = \\"badc\\" can be made special equivalent to any string in this group.The other two groups are [\\"xyzz\\", \\"zzxy\\"] and [\\"zzyx\\"].  Note that in particular, \\"zzxy\\" is not special equivalent to \\"zzyx\\".Example 2:Input: `A` = [\\"abc\\",\\"acb\\",\\"bac\\",\\"bca\\",\\"cab\\",\\"cba\\"], `B` = \\"bca\\"Output: [\\"bac\\", \\"bca\\"]Note:`1 <= A.length <= 1000``1 <= A[i].length, B.length <= 20`All `A[i]` and `B` have the same length.All `A[i]` and `B` consist of only lowercase letters.","answer":"We can solve this problem by using an unordered map (hashmap). The idea is to convert each string to a unique normalized form which is special equivalent to it. Then we count the occurrences of each normalized form in the list of strings. These counts represent the sizes of the groups of special equivalent strings.To convert a string into its normalized form, we divide the string characters into two groups: even indexed characters and odd indexed characters. We sort both groups and concatenate them. This will ensure that all special equivalent strings will have the same normalized form.Additionally, we convert string B into its normalized form and then search for this form in the hashmap. If found, we need to return all strings that have the same form in list `A`.Here is a Python solution for this problem:```pythonimport collectionsdef specialEquivalentStrings(A, B):    def normalize(S):        return \'\'.join(sorted(S[0::2]) + sorted(S[1::2]))    groupB = normalize(B)    groups = collections.defaultdict(list)    for s in A:        groups[normalize(s)].append(s)    if groupB in groups:        return groups[groupB]    else:        return []# Test the functionA = [\\"abcd\\",\\"cdab\\",\\"cbad\\",\\"xyzz\\",\\"zzxy\\",\\"zzyx\\"]B = \\"badc\\"print(specialEquivalentStrings(A, B))  # Output: [\\"abcd\\", \\"cdab\\", \\"cbad\\"]```In this code, `normalize` is a helper function that sorts the characters at even and odd indices separately. `specialEquivalentStrings` creates a map of normalized strings to their occurrences, then returns the group of strings that are special equivalent to string `B` if it exists, otherwise it returns an empty list."},{"question":"Translate the following decree into a legitimate regular expression algorithmic rule.

A regular expression that matches exactly these words and not as part of larger words could look like `b(keyword)b` where `keyword` will be each one of our words \\"start\\", \\"end\\", and \\"here\\". We use the `re.findall` function to return all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings.```pythonimport redef find_keywords(text):    pattern = r\'b(start|end|here)b\'    matches = re.findall(pattern, text)    return matchestext = \\"start your journey here and end it there\\"print(find_keywords(text))  # Output: [\'start\', \'here\', \'end\']text = \\"starting from here, ending there\\"print(find_keywords(text))  # Output: [\'here\']```The `b` in the regular expression makes sure that we are dealing with exact words, not sub-strings of a larger string.

In addition, it should delve into the complexities of data replication, the effects of variable consistency levels on read and write procedures, and the function of compaction in disk space management.","answer":"Guide to Formulate and Execute CQL Commands for Data within Apache Cassandra NoSQL Ecosystem1. CQL Basics:Cassandra Query Language (CQL) is similar to SQL; however, it doesn\'t support JOIN and sub-queries. Here\'s a brief:- USE: To switch between keyspaces. Example: USE Mykeyspace;  - SELECT: Retrieving data. Example: SELECT * FROM MyTable;  - INSERT: Inserting data. Example: INSERT INTO MyTable(column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);  - UPDATE: Updating data. Example: UPDATE MyTable SET column1 = value1 WHERE column2 = value2;  - DELETE: Deleting data. Example: DELETE FROM MyTable WHERE column1 = value1;2. Data Structure and Partitioning: Cassandra utilizes a partitioning scheme based on a partition key, which is the first part of the primary key. The data for the same partition key is stored together.3. Query Optimization:The WHERE clause in SELECT queries should use a partition key or a clustering key. Secondary indexes can facilitate wider data but are more costly.4. Consistency Levels and Replication: Cassandra offers tunable consistency. For any update or read operation, Cassandra defines consistency as the total number of replicas that will acknowledge an operation before it is deemed successful.5. Compaction:Compaction is the process to reclaim the disk space after DELETE operations and to improve read performance.6. Troubleshooting:DataStax offers tools like nodetool (command line), OpsCenter for data visualization, stress tool for performance testing, etc. - Stuck compactions, high GC pauses, and out of memory errors can be identified by checking logs and metrics.- SSTable corruption can be identified using the ‘sstabledump’ tool, and repaired using ‘sstablescrub’.7. Data Redundancy:Data redundancy is managed via replication and is a method of ensuring data durability and availability. 8. Read and Write Operations:Consistency levels effect read and write operations. Cassandra follows eventual consistency model, which means high write and read performance but all replicas might not have the most recent write.An optimal usage of Cassandra will depend on understanding and configuring the database based on specific use cases. It\'s recommended to check out DataStax docs and Academy courses which provide further details on managing a Cassandra database."},{"question":"Employ try-except clauses to identify and manage potential anomalies within your programming code.

The memory and time requirements for this would be astronomical - beyond the capabilities of modern computers.However, we can generate permutations for strings of a reasonable size (like below 10 characters) using Python\'s itertools module. Here\'s how you do it:```pythonimport itertoolsdef generate_permutations(s):    s = s.lower()    return [\'\'.join(p) for p in itertools.permutations(s)]s = \\"abc\\"permutations = generate_permutations(s)for p in permutations:    print(p)```This `generate_permutations` function firstly converts the input string to lower case to disregard capitalization. Then it uses \'itertools.permutations\' to generate all permutations of the input string. The permutations are then joined back into strings (as \'itertools.permutations\' produces tuples) and returned as a list.Be aware that the number of permutations of a string of length n is n factorial (n!). So even for a string of just 10 characters, this will generate over 3.6 million unique strings, which might take a while to compute and use a significant amount of memory.   However for the unique characters in string constraint, this code is already capable of performing the task since the \'itertools.permutations\' function never repeats characters in its permutations.So, in sum, generating permutations for strings up to 1,000 characters is not practically feasible due to computational limitations. This code can handle smaller strings (up to about 10 characters or so) efficiently."},{"question":"Devise an SQL command to extract records where the median numerical expression of an earmarked column falls under the numeric threshold of 20.","answer":"To solve this problem in SQL, we don\'t have any explicit built-in median function.

The inner SELECT with FROM clause sets a row index to each row.2. The ORDER BY clause in the inner SELECT arranges all rows in ascending order based on the numerical value of `earmarked_column`.3. The WHERE clause in the outer SELECT picks two rows - the one in the middle of the list (the one under it if the number of rows is even).4. AVG function returns the median.5. The HAVING clause checks if the median value is less than 20. Replace `YOUR_TABLE` with your actual table name and `earmarked_column` with your actual column name. Also be sure to take into account NULL values and how you\'d like to handle them.

This table is titled `user_logins` for the purpose of this answer. It is also assumed that the `user_logins` table has fields: `user_id`, `login_time`.The SQL command might look as follows:```SQLSELECT * FROM user_logins AS ulJOIN (  SELECT user_id, MAX(login_time) AS latest_login  FROM user_logins  GROUP BY user_id) AS max_login ON max_login.user_id = ul.user_id AND max_login.latest_login = ul.login_timeORDER BY ul.login_time DESC;```This SQL statement does the following:1. It creates a sub-query (the inner JOIN clause) that groups all logins by individual user IDs and selects the newest `login_time` for each ID.2. It joins this sub-query with the original `user_logins` table on the condition that both user_id and login_time match. This ensures we only get the row with the latest login time for each user.3. The `ORDER BY` command is used so that users who logged in most recently are at the top of the list.    Please replace `user_logins`, `user_id`, `login_time` in above query with your original table and column names."},{"question":"I\'d like to animate this SVG.

This software should be precisely engineered to display the string \'Hello World!\' considering a layered architecture that separates concerns among classes, and use an optimal software design pattern.","answer":"Below, I will make a simple design using Swift that displays the string \'Hello World!\' by separating concerns among classes using factory design pattern.Factory design pattern: This is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.```swiftprotocol Message {    func showMessage()}class HelloWorld: Message {    func showMessage() {        print(\\"Hello World!\\")    }}class MessageFactory {    func createMessage() -> Message {       return HelloWorld()    }}class App {    let messageFactory = MessageFactory()    func start() {        let message = messageFactory.createMessage()        message.showMessage()    }}```In this code, the `Message` protocol ensures that any class, which conforms it, should have a `showMessage` function. The `HelloWorld` class implements `Message` and defines how `showMessage` works.  The `MessageFactory` class creates a `HelloWorld` object by returning `HelloWord` instance when calling `createMessage`. Lastly, `App` class to use `MessageFactory` to initialize the `HelloWorld` object and call its method.From the main function you can create an instance of the App class and run the start method:```swiftlet app = App()app.start()```This will print \\"Hello World!\\" on the console."},{"question":"Implement an overriding operation for multiple \\"toString\\" methods connected to multiple specifically delineated entities encompassing inheritance and polymorphism within the realm of Java programming language.

Current approaches with this capability rely on supervised learning and human annotated groundings to train attention mechanisms inside the VQA architecture. Unfortunately, obtaining human annotations specific for visual grounding is difficult and expensive. In this work, we demonstrate that we can effectively train a VQA architecture with grounding supervision that can be automatically obtained from available region descriptions and object annotations. We also show that our model trained with this mined supervision generates visual groundings that achieve a higher correlation with respect to manually-annotated groundings, meanwhile achieving state-of-the-art VQA accuracy.Mining Attention Supervision from Visual GenomeVisual Genome (VG) BIBREF21 includes the largest VQA dataset currently available, which consists of 1.7M QA pairs. Furthermore, for each of its more than 100K images, VG also provides region and object annotations by means of bounding boxes. In terms of visual grounding, these region and object annotations provide complementary information. As an example, as shown in Figure FIGREF3 , for questions related to interaction between objects, region annotations result highly relevant. In contrast, for questions related to properties of specific objects, object annotations result more valuable. Consequently, in this section we present a method to automatically select region and object annotations from VG that can be used as labels to implement visual grounding as an auxiliary task for VQA.For region annotations, we propose a simple heuristic to mine visual groundings: for each INLINEFORM0 we enumerate all the region descriptions of INLINEFORM1 and pick the description INLINEFORM2 that has the most (at least two) overlapped informative words with INLINEFORM3 and INLINEFORM4 . Informative words are all nouns and verbs, where two informative words are matched if at least one of the following conditions is met: (1) Their raw text as they appear in INLINEFORM5 or INLINEFORM6 are the same; (2) Their lemmatizations (using NLTK BIBREF22 ) are the same; (3) Their synsets in WordNet BIBREF23 are the same; (4) Their aliases (provided from VG) are the same. We refer to the resulting labels as region-level groundings. Figure FIGREF3 (a) illustrates an example of a region-level grounding.In terms of object annotations, for each image in a INLINEFORM0 triplet we select the bounding box of an object as a valid grounding label, if the object name matches one of the informative nouns in INLINEFORM1 or INLINEFORM2 . To score each match, we use the same criteria as region-level groundings. Additionally, if a triplet INLINEFORM3 has a valid region grounding, each corresponding object-level grounding must be inside this region to be accepted as valid. As a further refinement, selected objects grounding are passed through an intersection over union filter to account for the fact that VG usually includes multiple labels for the same object instance. As a final consideration, for questions related to counting, region-level groundings are discarded after the corresponding object-level groundings are extracted. We refer to the resulting labels as object-level groundings. Figure FIGREF3 (b) illustrates an example of an object-level grounding.As a result, combining both region-level and object-level groundings, about 700K out of 1M INLINEFORM0 triplets in VG end up with valid grounding labels. We will make these labels publicly available.Implementation DetailsWe build the attention supervision on top of the open-sourced implementation of MCB BIBREF5 and MFB BIBREF12 . Similar to them, We extract the image feature from res5c layer of Resnet-152, resulting in INLINEFORM0 spatial grid ( INLINEFORM1 , INLINEFORM2 , INLINEFORM3 ). We construct our ground-truth visual grounding labels to be INLINEFORM4 glimpse maps per QA pair, where the first map is object-level grounding and the second map is region-level grounding, as discussed in Section SECREF4 . Let INLINEFORM5 be the coordinate of INLINEFORM6 selected object bounding box in the grounding labels, then the mined object-level attention maps INLINEFORM7 are: DISPLAYFORM0 where INLINEFORM0 is the indicator function. Similarly, the region-level attention maps INLINEFORM1 are: DISPLAYFORM0 Afterwards, INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 are spatially L1-normalized to represent probabilities and concatenated to form INLINEFORM2 .The model is trained using a multi-task loss, DISPLAYFORM0 where INLINEFORM0 denotes cross-entropy and INLINEFORM1 denotes KL-divergence. INLINEFORM2 corresponds to the learned parameters. INLINEFORM3 is a scalar that weights the loss terms. This scalar decays as a function of the iteration number INLINEFORM4 . In particular, we choose to use a cosine-decay function: DISPLAYFORM0 This is motivated by the fact that the visual grounding labels have some level of subjectivity. As an example, Figure FIGREF11 (second row) shows a case where the learned attention seems more accurate than the VQA-HAT ground truth. Hence, as the model learns suitable parameter values, we gradually loose the penalty on the attention maps to provide more freedom to the model to selectively decide what attention to use. It is important to note that, for training samples in VQA-2.0 or VG that do not have region-level or object-level grounding labels, INLINEFORM0 in Equation EQREF6 , so the loss is reduced to the classification term only. In our experiment, INLINEFORM1 is calibrated for each tested model based on the number of training steps. In particular, we choose INLINEFORM2 for all MCB models and INLINEFORM3 for others.DatasetsVQA-2.0: The VQA-2.0 dataset BIBREF2 consists of 204721 images, with a total of 1.1M questions and 10 crowd-sourced answers per question. There are more than 20 question types, covering a variety of topics and free-form answers. The dataset is split into training (82K images and 443K questions), validation (40K images and 214K questions), and testing (81K images and 448K questions) sets. The task is to predict a correct answer INLINEFORM0 given a corresponding image-question pair INLINEFORM1 . As a main advantage with respect to version 1.0 BIBREF2 , for every question VQA-2.0 includes complementary images that lead to different answers, reducing language bias by forcing the model to use the visual information.Visual Genome: The Visual Genome (VG) dataset BIBREF21 contains 108077 images, with an average of 17 QA pairs per image. We follow the processing scheme from BIBREF5 , where non-informative words in the questions and answers such as “a” and “is” are removed. Afterwards, INLINEFORM0 triplets with answers to be single keyword and overlapped with VQA-2.0 dataset are included in our training set. This adds 97697 images and about 1 million questions to the training set. Besides the VQA data, VG also provides on average 50 region descriptions and 30 object instances per image. Each region/object is annotated by one sentence/phrase description and bounding box coordinates.VQA-HAT: VQA-HAT dataset BIBREF4 contains 58475 human visual attention heat (HAT) maps for INLINEFORM0 triplets in VQA-1.0 training set. Annotators were shown a blurred image, a INLINEFORM1 pair and were asked to “scratch” the image until they believe someone else can answer the question by looking at the blurred image and the sharpened area. The authors also collect INLINEFORM2 HAT maps for VQA-1.0 validation sets, where each of the 1374 INLINEFORM3 were labeled by three different annotators, so one can compare the level of agreement among labels. We use VQA-HAT to evaluate visual grounding performance, by comparing the rank-correlation between human attention and model attention, as in BIBREF4 , BIBREF24 .VQA-X: VQA-X dataset BIBREF24 contains 2000 labeled attention maps in VQA-2.0 validation sets. In contrast to VQA-HAT, VQA-X attention maps are in the form of instance segmentations, where annotators were asked to segment objects and/or regions that most prominently justify the answer. Hence the attentions are more specific and localized. We use VQA-X to evaluate visual grounding performance by comparing the rank-correlation, as in BIBREF4 , BIBREF24 .ResultsWe evaluate the performance of our proposed method using two criteria: i) rank-correlation BIBREF25 to evaluate visual grounding and ii) accuracy to evaluate question answering. Intuitively, rank-correlation measures the similarity between human and model attention maps under a rank-based metric. A high rank-correlation means that the model is `looking at\' image areas that agree to the visual information used by a human to answer the same question. In terms of accuracy of a predicted answer INLINEFORM0 is evaluated by: DISPLAYFORM0 Table TABREF10 reports our main results. Our models are built on top of prior works with the additional Attention Supervision Module as described in Section SECREF3 . Specifically, we denote by Attn-* our adaptation of the respective model by including our Attention Supervision Module. We highlight that MCB model is the winner of VQA challenge 2016 and MFH model is the best single model in VQA challenge 2017. In Table TABREF10 , we can observe that our proposed model achieves a significantly boost on rank-correlation with respect to human attention. Furthermore, our model outperforms alternative state-of-art techniques in terms of accuracy in answer prediction. Specifically, the rank-correlation for MFH model increases by 36.4% when is evaluated in VQA-HAT dataset and 7.7% when is evaluated in VQA-X. This indicates that our proposed methods enable VQA models to provide more meaningful and interpretable results by generating more accurate visual grounding.Table TABREF10 also reports the result of an experiment where the decaying factor INLINEFORM0 in Equation EQREF7 is fixed to a value of 1. In this case, the model is able to achieve higher rank-correlation, but accuracy drops by 2%. We observe that as training proceeds, attention loss becomes dominant in the final training steps, which affects the accuracy of the classification module.Figure FIGREF11 shows qualitative results of the resulting visual grounding, including also a comparison with respect to no-attn model.ConclusionsIn this work we have proposed a new method that is able to slightly outperform current state-of-the-art VQA systems, while also providing interpretable representations in the form of an explicitly trainable visual attention mechanism. Specifically, as a main result, our experiments provide evidence that the generated visual groundings achieve high correlation with respect to human-provided attention annotations, outperforming the correlation scores of previous works by a large margin.As further contributions, we highlight two relevant insides of the proposed approach. On one side, by using attention labels as an auxiliary task, the proposed approach demonstrates that is able to constraint the internal representation of the model in such a way that it fosters the encoding of interpretable representations of the underlying relations between the textual question and input image. On other side, the proposed approach demonstrates a method to leverage existing datasets with region descriptions and object labels to effectively supervise the attention mechanism in VQA applications, avoiding costly human labeling.As future work, we believe that the superior visual grounding provided by the proposed method can play a relevant role to generate natural language explanations to justify the answer to a given visual question. This scenario will help to demonstrate the relevance of our technique as a tool to increase the capabilities of AI based technologies to explain their decisions.Acknowledgements: This work was partially funded by Oppo, Panasonic and the Millennium Institute for Foundational Research on Data.Figure 1.

Please answer the question. Do not include any text in your response other than the answer.Context: The graph attentional layer described in subsection 2.1 directly addresses several issues that were present in prior approaches to modelling graph-structured data with neural networks:•Computationally, it is highly efficient: the operation of the self-attentional layer can be parallelized across all edges, and the computation of output features can be parallelized across all nodes. No eigendecompositions or similar costly matrix operations are required. The time complexity of a single GAT attention head computing F^{prime} features may be expressed as O(|V|FF^{prime}+|E|F^{prime}), where F is the number of input features, and |V| and |E| are the numbers of nodes and edges in the graph, respectively. This complexity is on par with the baseline methods such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) (Kipf & Welling, 2017). Applying multi-head attention multiplies the storage and parameter requirements by a factor of K, while the individual heads’ computations are fully independent and can be parallelized.•As opposed to GCNs, our model allows for (implicitly) assigning different importances to nodes of a same neighborhood, enabling a leap in model capacity. Furthermore, analyzing the learned attentional weights may lead to benefits in interpretability, as was the case in the machine translation domain (e.g. the qualitative analysis of Bahdanau et al. (2015)).•The attention mechanism is applied in a shared manner to all edges in the graph, and therefore it does not depend on upfront access to the global graph structure or (features of) all of its nodes (a limitation of many prior techniques). This has several desirable implications:–The graph is not required to be undirected (we may simply leave out computing alpha_{ij} if edge jrightarrow i is not present).–It makes our technique directly applicable to inductive learning—including tasks where the model is evaluated on graphs that are completely unseen during training.•The recently published inductive method of Hamilton et al. (2017) samples a fixed-size neighborhood of each node, in order to keep its computational footprint consistent; this does not allow it access to the entirety of the neighborhood while performing inference. Moreover, this technique achieved some of its strongest results when an LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997)-based neighborhood aggregator is used. This assumes the existence of a consistent sequential node ordering across neighborhoods, and the authors have rectified it by consistently feeding randomly-ordered sequences to the LSTM. Our technique does not suffer from either of these issues—it works with the entirety of the neighborhood (at the expense of a variable computational footprint, which is still on-par with methods like the GCN), and does not assume any ordering within it.•As mentioned in Section 1, GAT can be reformulated as a particular instance of MoNet (Monti et al., 2016). More specifically, setting the pseudo-coordinate function to be u(x,y)=f(x)|f(y), where f(x) represent (potentially MLP-transformed) features of node x and | is concatenation; and the weight function to be w_{j}(u)=mathrm{softmax}(mathrm{MLP}(u)) (with the softmax performed over the entire neighborhood of a node) would make MoNet’s patch operator similar to ours. Nevertheless, one should note that, in comparison to previously considered MoNet instances, our model uses node features for similarity computations, rather than the node’s structural properties (which would assume knowing the graph structure upfront). We were able to produce a version of the GAT layer that leverages sparse matrix operations, reducing the storage complexity to linear in the number of nodes and edges and enabling the execution of GAT models on larger graph datasets. However, the tensor manipulation framework we used only supports sparse matrix multiplication for rank-2 tensors, which limits the batching capabilities of the layer as it is currently implemented (especially for datasets with multiple graphs). Appropriately addressing this constraint is an important direction for future work. Depending on the regularity of the graph structure in place, GPUs may not be able to offer major performance benefits compared to CPUs in these sparse scenarios. It should also be noted that the size of the “receptive field” of our model is upper-bounded by the depth of the network (similarly as for GCN and similar models). Techniques such as skip connections (He et al., 2016) could be readily applied for appropriately extending the depth, however. Lastly, parallelization across all the graph edges, especially in a distributed manner, may involve a lot of redundant computation, as the neighborhoods will often highly overlap in graphs of interest. For the inductive learning task, we apply a three-layer GAT model. Both of the first two layers consist of K=4 attention heads computing F^{prime}=256 features (for a total of 1024 features), followed by an ELU nonlinearity. The final layer is used for (multi-label) classification: K=6 attention heads computing 121 features each, that are averaged and followed by a logistic sigmoid activation. The training sets for this task are sufficiently large and we found no need to apply L_{2} regularization or dropout—we have, however, successfully employed skip connections (He et al., 2016) across the intermediate attentional layer. We utilize a batch size of 2 graphs during training. To strictly evaluate the benefits of applying an attention mechanism in this setting (i.e. comparing with a near GCN-equivalent model), we also provide the results when a constant attention mechanism, a(x,y)=1, is used, with the same architecture—this will assign the same weight to every neighbor.Question: What point is different in GATs in terms of assigning weight compared to GCN?","answer":"GATs uses implicit weight assigning while GCN doesn\'t."},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

(2004) speculate that deeper linguistic knowledge needs to be made available to resolvers in order to reach the next level of performance. In knowledge-lean approaches, coreference resolvers employ only morpho-syntactic cues as knowledge sources in the resolution process (e.g., Mitkov (1998), Tetreault (2001)). In the past decade, knowledge-lean approaches have significantly influenced research in noun phrase (NP) coreference resolution â the problem of determining which NPs refer to the same real-world entity in a document.Citation Sentence:While these approaches have been reasonably successful ( see Mitkov ( 2002 ) ) , Kehler et al. ( 2004 ) speculate that deeper linguistic knowledge needs to be made available to resolvers in order to reach the next level of performance .Context after the citation:In fact, semantics plays a crucially important role in the resolution of common NPs, allowing us to identify the coreference relation between two lexically dissimilar common nouns (e.g., talks and negotiations) and to eliminate George W. Bush from the list of candidate antecedents of the city, for instance. As a result, researchers have re-adopted the once-popular knowledge-rich approach, investigating a variety of semantic knowledge sources for common noun resolution, such as the semantic relations between two NPs (e.g., Ji et al. (2005)), their semantic similarity as computed using WordNet (e.g., Poesio et al. (2004)) or Wikipedia (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006), and the contextual role played by an NP (see Bean and Riloff (2004)). Another type of semantic knowledge that has been employed by coreference resolvers is the semantic class (SC) of an NP, which can be used to disallow coreference between semantically incompatible NPs. However, learning-based resolvers have not been able to benefit from having an SC agreement feature, presumably because the method used to compute the SC of an NP is too simplistic: while the SC of a proper name is computed fairly accurately using a named entity (NE) recognizer, many resolvers simply assign to a common noun the first (i.e., most frequent) WordNet sense as its SC (e.g., Soon et al.

Synergy of Communication, Computing and Caching 1. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Decisive progress in 5G mobile technology, fueled by a rapid proliferation of computation- hungry and delay-sensitive services, puts economic pressure on the research community to rethink the fundamentals of underlying networking architectures. Along these lines, the first half of this article offers a first-hand tutorial on the most recent advances in content-centric networking, emerging user applications, as well as enabling system architectures. We establish that while significant progress has been made along the individual vectors of communications, caching, and computing, together with some promising steps in proposing hybrid functionalities, the ultimate synergy behind a fully integrated solution is not nearly well understood. Against this background, the second half of this work carefully brings into perspective additional important factors, such as user mobility patterns, aggressive application requirements, and associated operator deployment capabilities, to conduct comprehensive system-level analysis. Furthermore, supported by a full-fledged practical trial on a live cellular network, our systematic findings reveal the most dominant factors in converged 5G-grade communications, caching, and computing layouts, as well as indicate the natural optimization points for system operators to leverage the maximum available benefits.Literature Review:","answer":"By enabling the mobile network with more computing capability, the scarce communication resources could be saved. In BIB001 , a content-slimming system is proposed, which detect redundant video content and clip the from the original frames by computing and only transmit the necessary video content. This scheme reduce the transmission bandwidth consumption at least by 50% compared to H.264 without sacrifice video quality and visual experience. The application types, user mobility and communication resources will influence the optimal position of deploying computing and caching resources BIB002 . For the low bandwidth, high persistence use cases that require computing tasks, computing resources should not be deployed at femtocells because frequent handovers and low computational power of the femtocells, especially when the backhaul transmission delays are minimal. For the high-bandwidth location-bound services require storage resources, such as AR, the computing and caching resources should be deployed as close to the end user as possible. In summary, computing and caching resources deployed at different layers of the network should be utilized according to the service types with the consideration of backhaul capacity."},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

METHODS: Data about the total number of cases, tests, and rates of COVID-19 as of June 10, 2020 were obtained for cities and towns in MA. The data on COVID-19 were matched with data on various SDoH variables at the city and town level from the American Community Survey. These variables included information about income, poverty, employment, renting, and insurance coverage. We compared COVID-19 rates according to these SDoH variables. RESULTS: There were clear gradients in the rates of COVID-19 according to SDoH variables. Communities with more poverty, lower income, lower insurance coverage, more unemployment, and a higher percentage of the workforce employed in essential services, including healthcare, had higher rates of COVID-19. Most of these differences were not accounted for by different rates of testing in these cities and towns. CONCLUSIONS: SDoH variables may explain some of the variability in the risk of COVID-19 across cities and towns in MA. Data about SDoH should be part of the standard surveillance for COVID-19.

We used transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to identify children with sickle cell anemia who were at high risk for stroke and then randomly assigned them to receive standard care or transfusions to prevent a first stroke.                To enter the study, children with sickle cell anemia and no history of stroke had to have undergone two transcranial Doppler studies that showed that the time-averaged mean blood-flow velocity in the internal carotid or middle cerebral artery was 200 cm per second or higher. The patients were randomly assigned to receive standard care or transfusions to reduce the hemoglobin S concentration to less than 30 percent of the total hemoglobin concentration. The incidence of stroke (cerebral infarction or intracranial hemorrhage) was compared between the two groups.                A total of 130 children (mean [+/-SD] age, 8.3+/-3.3 years) were enrolled; 63 were randomly assigned to receive transfusions and 67 to receive standard care. At base line, the transfusion group had a slightly lower mean hemoglobin concentration (7.2 vs. 7.6 g per deciliter, P=0.001) and hematocrit (20.4 vs. 21.7 percent, P=0.002). Ten patients dropped out of the transfusion group, and two patients crossed over from the standard-care group to the transfusion group. There were 10 cerebral infarctions and 1 intracerebral hematoma in the standard-care group, as compared with 1 infarction in the transfusion group -- a 92 percent difference in the risk of stroke (P<0.001). This result led to the early termination of the trial.                Transfusion greatly reduces the risk of a first stroke in children with sickle cell anemia who have abnormal results on transcranial Doppler ultrasonography.Title 2:Intra-individual variation in blood flow velocities in cerebral arteries of children with sickle cell disease.Abstract 2:Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at elevated risk of stroke. Risk increases with blood flow velocity in selected cerebral arteries, as measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound, and use of TCD to screen these patients is widely recommended. Interpretation of TCD results should be based on knowledge of intra-individual variation in blood flow velocity, information not currently available for sickle cell patients.                Between 1995 and 2002, 4,141 subjects, 2-16 years old, with homozygous SCD or Sbeta0-thalasemmia and no history of stroke were screened with TCD, including 2,018 subjects screened in one clinical trial (STOP), 1,816 screened in another (STOP 2), and 307 screened in an interim ancillary prospective study. The 812 subjects with >or=2 examinations<6 months apart were selected for analysis, including 242 (29.8%) subjects with normal average velocities (i.e., <170 cm/sec), 350 (43.1%) subjects with conditional velocities (i.e., 170-199 cm/sec), and 220 (27.1%) subjects with abnormal velocities (i.e., >or=200 cm/sec). The intra-subject standard deviation of TCD velocity was estimated from the difference between velocities at the first two interpretable examinations on each subject.                An intra-subject standard deviation of 14.9 cm/sec was obtained. Seven (0.9%) subjects had unusually large and unexplained differences between velocities at the two examinations (range of absolute differences: 69-112 cm/sec).                While stroke risk is well demonstrated to increase with increasingly abnormal TCD velocity, given the relatively large intra-subject variability, one TCD examination is generally not sufficient to characterize stroke risk in this patient population.

Here\'s why:- `R` is designed to handle `NA` values appropriately in calculations including correlations. When we calculate correlation and if there are `NA` in either of the two variables, `R` computes correlation based on pairs of observations where neither is missing.- However, if you replace missing values with zeros, you are essentially assigning a value where one does not exist. This can seriously distort your data and thus the calculation of correlations, which might lead to incorrect conclusions.That being said, how to handle missing data depends on the context of the situation. However, imputing them with Zero is mostly not a good approach and should be avoided.There are also strategies for replacing missing values with the mean or median of existing values, but such strategies should be used carefully, considering the context and pattern of missing data. In case of random missingness, imputation could be considered taking care of bias it could introduce. The function `cor` also has an argument `use` to handle NA\'s, you can check that out in R documentation. Example would be using `cor(x, y, use = \\"pairwise.complete.obs\\")` - it computes correlation in a pairwise manner excluding NA\'s."},{"question":"Design a class in Python which emulates a credit card system utilizing the principles of class, object, and inheritance.","answer":"Here is an example of how you could design the class:```pythonclass CreditCard:    def __init__(self, customer, bank, acnt, limit):        self._customer = customer        self._bank = bank        self._account = acnt        self._limit = limit        self._balance = 0    def get_customer(self):        return self._customer    def get_bank(self):        return self._bank    def get_account(self):        return self._account    def get_limit(self):        return self._limit    def get_balance(self):        return self._balance    def charge(self, price):        if price + self._balance > self._limit:              return False          else:            self._balance += price              return True    def make_payment(self, amount):        self._balance -= amount# To emulate inheritance, let\'s create a subclass for a specific type of credit card - Rewards Credit Cardclass RewardsCreditCard(CreditCard):    def __init__(self, customer, bank, acnt, limit, reward_rate):        super().__init__(customer, bank, acnt, limit)        self._reward_rate = reward_rate        self._rewards = 0    def charge(self, price):        approval = super().charge(price)        if approval:            self._rewards += self._reward_rate * price        return approval    def redeem_rewards(self, amount):        if amount > self._rewards:            return False        else:            self._rewards -= amount            self._balance -= amount            return True    def get_rewards(self):        return self._rewards```The class `CreditCard` represents a standard credit card.

We argue that one of the main reasons that current approaches do not perform well, is that the information is represented sub-optimally. A natural way to describe what we observe, is through natural language. In this paper, we implement a natural language state representation to learn and complete tasks. Our experiments suggest that natural language based agents are more robust, converge faster and perform better than vision based agents, showing the benefit of using natural language representations for Reinforcement Learning.Introduction“The world of our experiences must be enormously simplified and generalized before it is possible to make a symbolic inventory of all our experiences of things and relations.\\"(Edward Sapir, Language: An Introduction to the Study of Speech, 1921)Deep Learning based algorithms use neural networks in order to learn feature representations that are good for solving high dimensional Machine Learning (ML) tasks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a subfield of ML that has been greatly affected by the use of deep neural networks as universal function approximators BIBREF0, BIBREF1. These deep neural networks are used in RL to estimate value functions, state-action value functions, policy mappings, next-state predictions, rewards, and more BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF4, thus combating the “curse of dimensionality\\".The term representation is used differently in different contexts. For the purpose of this paper we define a semantic representation of a state as one that reflects its meaning as it is understood by an expert. The semantic representation of a state should thus be paired with a reliable and computationally efficient method for extracting information from it. Previous success in RL has mainly focused on representing the state in its raw form (e.g., visual input in Atari-based games BIBREF2). This approach stems from the belief that neural networks (specifically convolutional networks) can extract meaningful features from complex inputs. In this work, we challenge current representation techniques and suggest to represent the state using natural language, similar to the way we, as humans, summarize and transfer information efficiently from one to the other BIBREF5.The ability to associate states with natural language sentences that describe them is a hallmark of understanding representations for reinforcement learning. Humans use rich natural language to describe and communicate their visual perceptions, feelings, beliefs, strategies, and more. The semantics inherent to natural language carry knowledge and cues of complex types of content, including: events, spatial relations, temporal relations, semantic roles, logical structures, support for inference and entailment, as well as predicates and arguments BIBREF6. The expressive nature of language can thus act as an alternative semantic state representation.Over the past few years, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has shown an acceleration in progress on a wide range of downstream applications ranging from Question Answering BIBREF7, BIBREF8, to Natural Language Inference BIBREF9, BIBREF10, BIBREF11 through Syntactic Parsing BIBREF12, BIBREF13, BIBREF14. Recent work has shown the ability to learn flexible, hierarchical, contextualized representations, obtaining state-of-the-art results on various natural language processing tasks BIBREF15. A basic observation of our work is that natural language representations are also beneficial for solving problems in which natural language is not the underlying source of input. Moreover, our results indicate that natural language is a strong alternative to current complementary methods for semantic representations of a state.In this work we assume a state can be described using natural language sentences. We use distributional embedding methods in order to represent sentences, processed with a standard Convolutional Neural Network for feature extraction. In Section SECREF2 we describe the basic frameworks we rely on. We discuss possible semantic representations in Section SECREF3, namely, raw visual inputs, semantic segmentation, feature vectors, and natural language representations. Then, in Section SECREF4 we compare NLP representations with their alternatives. Our results suggest that representation of the state using natural language can achieve better performance, even on difficult tasks, or tasks in which the description of the state is saturated with task-nuisances BIBREF17. Moreover, we observe that NLP representations are more robust to transfer and changes in the environment. We conclude the paper with a short discussion and related work.Preliminaries ::: Reinforcement LearningIn Reinforcement Learning the goal is to learn a policy pi (s), which is a mapping from state s to a probability distribution over actions mathcal {A}, with the objective to maximize a reward r(s) that is provided by the environment. This is often solved by formulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) BIBREF19. Two common quantities used to estimate the performance in MDPs are the value v (s) and action-value Q (s, a) functions, which are defined as follows: {v(s) = mathbb {E}^{pi } [sum _t gamma ^t r_t | s_0 = s ]} and {Q(s, a) = mathbb {E}^{pi } [sum _t gamma ^t r_t | s_0 = s, a_0 = a ]}. Two prominent algorithms for solving RL tasks, which we use in this paper, are the value-based DQN BIBREF2 and the policy-based PPO BIBREF3.Deep Q Networks (DQN): The DQN algorithm is an extension of the classical Q-learning approach, to a deep learning regime. Q-learning learns the optimal policy by directly learning the value function, i.e., the action-value function. A neural network is used to estimate the Q-values and is trained to minimize the Bellman error, namelyProximal Policy Optimization (PPO): While the DQN learns the optimal behavioral policy using a dynamic programming approach, PPO takes a different route. PPO builds upon the policy gradient theorem, which optimizes the policy directly, with an addition of a trust-region update rule. The policy gradient theorem updates the policy bySemantic Representation MethodsContemporary methods for semantic representation of states currently follow one of three approaches: (1) raw visual inputs BIBREF2, BIBREF26, in which raw sensory values of pixels are used from one or multiple sources, (2) feature vectors BIBREF27, BIBREF28, in which general features of the problem are chosen, with no specific structure, and (3) semantic segmentation maps BIBREF29, BIBREF30, in which discrete or logical values are used in one or many channels to represent the general features of the state.The common approach is to derive decisions (e.g., classification, action, etc.) based on information in its raw form. In RL, the raw form is often the pixels representing an image – however the image is only one form of a semantic representation. In Semantic Segmentation, the image is converted from a 3-channel (RGB) matrix into an N-channel matrix, where N is the number of classes. In this case, each channel represents a class, and a binary value at each coordinate denotes whether or not this class is present in the image at this location. For instance, fig: semantic segmentation example considers an autonomous vehicle task. The raw image and segmentation maps are both sufficient for the task (i.e., both contain a sufficient semantic representation). Nevertheless, the semantic segmentation maps contain less task-nuisances BIBREF17, which are random variables that affect the observed data, but are not informative to the task we are trying to solve.In this paper we propose a forth method for representing a state, namely using natural language descriptions. One method to achieve such a representation is through Image Captioning BIBREF31, BIBREF32. Natural language is both rich as well as flexible. This flexibility enables the algorithm designer to represent the information present in the state as efficiently and compactly as possible. As an example, the top image in fig: semantic segmentation example can be represented using natural language as “There is a car in your lane two meters in front of you, a bicycle rider on your far left in the negative lane, a car in your direction in the opposite lane which is twenty meters away, and trees and pedestrians on the side walk.” or compactly by “There is a car two meters in front of you a pedestrian on the sidewalk to your right and a car inbound in the negative lane which is far away.”. Language also allows us to efficiently compress information. As an example, the segmentation map in the bottom image of fig: semantic segmentation example can be compactly described by “There are 13 pedestrians crossing the road in front of you”. In the next section we will demonstrate the benefits of using natural-language-based semantic state representation in a first person shooter enviornment.Appendix ::: Model implementationAll of our models were implemented using PyTorch. The DQN agents used a single network that outputs the Q-Values of the available actions. The PPO agents used an Actor-Critic model with two networks; the first outputs the policy distribution for the input state, and the second network outputs it\'s value. As mentioned earlier, we used three common neural network architectures:used for the raw image and semantic segmentation based agents. VizDoom\'s raw output image resolution is 640X480X3 RGB image. We experimented with both the original image and its down-sampled version. The semantic segmentation image was of resolution 640X480X1, where the pixel value represents the object\'s class, generated using the VizDoom label API. the network consisted of two convolutional layers, two hidden linear layers and an output layer. The first convolutional layer has 8 6X6 filters with stride 3 and ReLU activation. The second convolutional layer has 16 3X3 filters with stride 2 and ReLU activation. The fully connected layers has 32 and 16 units, both of them are followed by ReLU activation. The output layer\'s size is the amount of actions the agent has available in the trained scenario.Used in the feature vector based agent. Naturally, some discretization is needed in order to build a feature vector, so some of the state data is lost. the feature vector was made using features we extracted from the VizDoom API, and its dimensions was 90 X 1. The network is made up of two fully connected layers, each of them followed by a ReLU activation. The first layer has 32 units, and the second one one has 16 units. The output layer\'s size was the amount of actions available to the agent.Used in the natural language based agent. As previously mentioned, each word in the natural language state is transformed into a 200X50X1 matrix. The first layers of the TextCNN are convolutional layers with 8 filter which are designed to scan input sentence, and return convolution outputs of sequences of varying lengths. The filters vary in width, such that each of them learns to identify different lengths of sequences in words. Longer filters have higher capability of extracting features from longer word sequences. The filters we have chosen have the following dimensions: 3X50X1, 4X50X1, 5X50X1, 8X50X1,11X50X1. Following the convolution layer there is a ReLU activation and a max pool layer. Finally, there are two fully connected layers; The first layer has 32 units, and second one has 16 units. Both of them are followed by ReLU activation.All architectures have the same output, regardless of the input type. The DQN network is a regression network, with its output size the number of available actions. The PPO agent has 2 networks; actor and critic. The actor network has a Softmax activation with size equal to the available amount of actions. The critic network is a regression model with a single output representing the state\'s value. Reward plots for the PPO agent can be found in Figure FIGREF47.Figure 3: Frame division used for describing the state in natural language.Figure 4: Natural language state representation for a simple state (top) and complex state (bottom).

But when you pass an array to the push() method, it will add these items as an array (i.e., a single element), not as individual items.To solve this, you can use the spread syntax (...). It allows an iterable (like an array) to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments are expected. In this case, it will expand the `newItems` array, and `push()` method will treat them as individual elements.Here is the corrected JavaScript code:```javascriptmyArr.push(...newItems);```After running this code, `myArr` will have the expected elements: `[\'a\', \'b\', \'c\', \'d\', \'e\', \'f\']`."},{"question":"Create a Django application for a poll system with real-time updates.

The function should be equipped to handle edge cases such as a list that is empty, a list that contains a single element, or a shift number that exceeds the list\'s boundaries. It should also be able to handle lists that contain duplicate elements while preserving the original sequence of these elements after sorting (stable sort). The function should be adept at handling lists that include negative integers, floating point numbers, and even complex numbers. It should also be able to handle lists with elements of various data types (integers, floating point numbers, strings, and complex numbers). The function should arrange the string elements in alphabetical order and position them after the numeric elements in the sorted segment of the list. The function should also be skilled in handling lists with nested lists and even lists with nested dictionaries. The nested lists should be organized in ascending order based on the sum of their elements and positioned after the string elements in the sorted segment of the list. The dictionaries should be sorted based on the sum of their values and positioned after the nested lists in the sorted segment of the list.Moreover, the function should be able to handle lists that contain custom objects. The custom objects should be sorted based on a specific attribute and positioned after the dictionaries in the sorted segment of the list. Consider the following flawed code snippet as a reference. This code tries to shift and sort the list, but it fails in handling edge cases, preserving the original sequence of duplicate elements after sorting, managing negative and floating point numbers, sorting elements of various data types, and managing nested lists and dictionaries.```pythondef shift_and_sort(lst, num):    lst[:num] = lst[num:] + lst[:num]    lst[num:] = sorted(lst[num:])    return lst```Your task is to correct this code and add the necessary functionality. The function should return the modified list. The function should also be able to handle large lists efficiently, without exceeding the time and space complexity of O(n log n).

It begins by handling any edge cases: if `lst` is empty, the function returns an empty list. If `num` exceeds the length of `lst`, `num` is set to `num` modulo the length of `lst` (in other words, `num` becomes the remainder of `num` divided by the length of `lst`). This prevents index errors when shifting the list.Next, this function shifts `lst` by `num` positions.The rest of the function involves sorting `lst`. The function begins this process by segregating the different types of elements into their separate structures. Then, it sorts each structure in ascending order. The function sorts numbers normally, strings alphabetically, lists by the sum of their elements, dictionaries by the sum of their values, and objects by a specific attribute (replace `\'attribute\'` with the actual attribute you want to sort by).Finally, the function concatenates all these sorted structures and returns the resultant list. This arrangement orders the numeric elements first, followed by string elements, then lists, then dictionaries, and finally objects. Note that this function assumes that all objects have the attribute specified for sorting; if this is not the case, the function may raise an `AttributeError`.This function handles a wide range of intricate situations and preserves the original sequence of duplicate elements. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sort operations, which makes it efficient for large data. It is also able to sort elements having various data types, including negative and floating point numbers as well as complex numbers."},{"question":"Devise a Python function that calculates the position of the smallest triangular number that encompasses a specific digit count, denoted as n, by applying the mathematical concept of triangular numbers.

This clause is not commonly used and it can handle potential issues that would occur from NULL values in this field- The `LEFT JOIN` clause is used to combine rows from `Customers` and `Orders` tables. Even if a customer does not have any entries in the `Orders` table (i.e., never made a purchase), their details will still be included in the result due to the `LEFT JOIN`. If we were to use a `INNER JOIN` instead, those customers would be excluded from the result.- The `GROUP BY` clause is used to consolidate the orders made by each customer.- The result is sorted in descending order by the total purchase amount made by each customer with the help of the `ORDER BY` clause.

This condition comes straightly from the fact that one diagonal divides the quadrilateral into two triangles, and each triangle makes the sum of the angles 180 degrees.Therefore, if we take an arbitrary vertex A, the sum of the angles in this vertex will be equal to the sum of the angles in the opposite vertex C. And similarly, the sum of the angles in corner B will be equal to the sum of the angles in corner D.We are looking for the number of valid permutations of the corner angles that will meet these two conditions and where all corner angles are integers.This problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach. First, we will generate a list of possible sums of two distinct integer angles in the range from 0 to 180. Then, we will use these sums to populate a matrix that will keep track of the number of valid corner angle permutations for each possible pair of opposite corners.The final result will be divided by two to exclude mirror duplicates (because rotating or flipping the quadrilateral doesn\'t change its angles).Here is a Python code snippet that will compute the result:```pythonfrom collections import defaultdictMAX_ANGLE = 180angle_counts = defaultdict(int)for a1 in range(1, MAX_ANGLE + 1):  for a2 in range(a1 + 1, MAX_ANGLE + 1):    angle_counts[a1 + a2] += 1dp = [[0 for _ in range(MAX_ANGLE + 1)] for _ in range(MAX_ANGLE + 1)]for diff in range(MAX_ANGLE + 1):  dp[diff][diff] = angle_counts[diff] * angle_counts[diff]for diff in range(1, MAX_ANGLE + 1):  for n in range(diff - 1, -1, -1):    dp[n][diff] += dp[n + 1][diff] + dp[n][diff - 1] - dp[n + 1][diff - 1]count = dp[0][MAX_ANGLE]# Exclude mirror duplicates.count //= 2print(count)```Note: This code might not run fast, but it\'s only a simple approach.

Zebrafish have been extensively used in biomedical research as a model to study vertebrate development but it is only recently that it has also been adopted into varied fields such as immunology and host-pathogen interactions. Zebrafish have a rapid life cycle, small size and the adults exhibit no territorial behavior in relatively dense cages. Under standard conditions each female lays an average of a hundred eggs per clutch, providing a large number of larvae per week. Their transparency during early life stages allows real time visualization of the different organs, which makes them especially suitable for the study of bacterial host-pathogen interactions. Traditionally, these studies have been technically challenging in higher organisms, given the loss of control over the bacteria once the pathogen infects its host. Here we describe an emerging approach to monitor Salmonella typhimurium infection progression using in vivo fluorescence upon parenteral infection. We have engineered Salmonella with the Cascade expression system; an efficient method to voluntarily activate bacterial heterologous gene expression at any point during infection once inside the Zebrafish macrophages, using a non-toxic inducer.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": []}"},{"question":"Design a multi-threaded C++ program that generates and prints out a Fibonacci series of up to 100 elements.

After we call the `rotateRight` function on this array, the last element of the array goes to the first position and all other elements move one position to the right resulting in the new array {5, 1, 2, 3, 4} which is then printed.You can also adjust this code to rotate left if you want, or even rotate multiple positions by calling the `rotateRight` or `rotateLeft` function in a loop. Note that in real-world code, you may want to check for things like null or empty arrays, etc. for added robustness. Remember that C++ has no intrinsic circular shift operation, circular shift of an array is implemented manually as seen in the above code.

Recently, ambient ionization MS using liquid extraction techniques, such as nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI),11 liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA),12 and the liquid microjunction surface sampling probe (LMJ-SSP),13 were applied to image proteins from biological tissue sections. In the latter two studies, protein analysis was enhanced by integrating ion mobility separation into the workflow, which allowed selective transmission of protein ions and reduced chemical noise in the mass spectra.12,13 Here, we describe the optimization of DESI-MS imaging for protein analysis and further coupling of DESI to a high field asymmetric waveform ion mobility (FAIMS) device for imaging proteins from biological tissue sections, indicating that this approach could be used for top-down proteomics studies in various biomedical applications.</p><p>We first evaluated the effectiveness of a washing step with organic solvents on enhancing protein detection, which is commonly performed in MALDI-MS imaging experiments to remove endogenous lipids and biological salts that may affect efficiency of protein desorption and ionization.14 Detailed methods are provided in the Supporting Information. DESI-MS imaging was performed on an unwashed mouse kidney tissue section in the positive ion mode using pure ACN as the solvent and typical DESI-MS lipid imaging parameters (Table S1).15 Ions identified as triacylglycerols and glycerophosphocholines were detected at high relative abundances (Figure 1a),15 while multiply charged protein ions were not seen. Next, a solvent system of ACN–H2O (80:20) (v/v) with 0.2% formic acid previously reported to enhance protein desorption by nano-DESI was used for analysis of unwashed tissue sections, at a flow rate of 5 μL/min.11 Similar lipid species were detected at high relative abundances in addition to multiply charged ions at low abundances that were tentatively identified as protein species (Figure 1b). The lipid washing step was then performed on an adjacent mouse kidney tissue section followed by DESI-MS imaging analysis at the same parameters (Figure 1c). While the washing step was effective at removing lipids, the mass spectra obtained presented low total ion abundance of the multiple charged ions. Previous studies have reported that the desorption of protein standards from glass slides by DESI-MS is dependent on the spray angle and spray-to-surface distance.10,16 Thus, we performed optimization of DESI spray parameters for protein detection by tuning the angle, spray-to-sample distance, and sample-to-inlet distance to 55°, 3.5 mm, and 2.5 mm, respectively. Performance was evaluated by the improvement in the total ion abundance of m/z 938.117, later identified as an alpha-globin proteoform with an asparagine to a lysine substitution. While protein ions were detected in mouse kidney tissue at various spray-to-sample and sample-to-inlet distances, proteins were not detected above a S/N = 3 using spray angles other than 55°, indicating that protein desorption and detection is more strongly dependent on the spray angle than other source parameters. At these optimized parameters, the alpha-globin proteoform was detected with a S/N = 27.9 (average of n = 3 tissue sections, n = 3 lines/tissue section, n = 20 mass spectra/line), as well as 10 other distinct protein species (Figure 1d).</p><p>In an effort to further increase the S/N of proteins, we integrated FAIMS to the DESI-MS imaging source and mass spectrometer interface as we have previously described.13 Two-dimensional FAIMS sweep experiments were performed to determine the optimal dispersion field (DF = 180 Td) and compensation field (CF = +1.0 Td) for protein detection. Under the optimized FAIMS parameters, a S/N = 32.1 was achieved for the alpha-globin proteoform (average of n = 3 tissue sections, n = 3 lines/tissue section, n = 20 mass spectra/line), as well as detection of 10 other distinct protein species (Table S2 and Figure 1e). The addition of FAIMS increased the S/N for all the proteins detected, thus improving image contrast and quality (Figure S1). The increase in the S/N of protein ions was due to the substantial filtering of interfering background species (68% decrease), including abundant solvent peaks and reduction of chemical noise (43% decrease), despite an overall drop (30%) in the absolute intensities of protein ions (Figure S2). Therefore, all further experiments were performed using the optimized FAIMS parameters. Spray voltage and transfer capillary temperature were also tuned to optimal values of 1 kV and 300 °C for protein detection, respectively, using the optimized DESI-FAIMS parameters (Figures S3 and S4). For more details on the effect of FAIMS in the data and the optimization approach, please see the Supporting Information.</p><p>Top-down and bottom-up protein-sequencing methods were explored to identify the proteins detected. On-tissue CID was performed by isolating and fragmenting protein ions while directly profiling the tissue sections using DESI-MS alone (no FAIMS). Fragmentation of the 13+ charge state isotope envelope of the ion at m/z 1,153.298 (MM = 15 085 Da, Figure S5) by CID allowed identification of this ion as the alpha globin protein (16% sequence coverage) in mouse kidney tissue sections. Other proteoforms of alpha-globin were detected at high relative abundances, which are likely associated with the highly vascularized nature of the kidney tissue. In an effort to obtain higher sequence coverage, UVPD was integrated with DESI-MS for on-tissue protein fragmentation (no FAIMS).17 The proteoform of alpha-globin presenting an asparagine to a lysine substitution (MM = 14 985 Da) used for optimization was identified by on-tissue UVPD of m/z 938.114 (16+ charge state, 32% sequence coverage) (Figure 1f and Figure S6). Hemoglobin α (m/z 1009.335, 15+ charge state) was identified from normal human ovarian tissue using on-tissue UVPD (sequence coverage of 20%). These results demonstrate feasibility of UVPD for the identification of abundant proteins detected using DESI-MS from biological tissue sections, and to the best of our knowledge represent the first application of UVPD for on-tissue protein identification. Nevertheless, further optimization of this integrated approach is needed for fragmentation and identification of lower abundant protein species. Top-down UVPD and bottom-up proteomics were also performed on protein extracts obtained from the tissues analyzed to assist in the identification of low abundance protein ions. Sequence coverage for the proteins identified and the respective method used are provided in Table S3.</p><p>Next, we applied the optimized DESI-FAIMS approach to image proteins from biological tissue sections. As shown in Figure 2a, DESI-FAIMS allowed imaging of a variety of proteins from mouse brain tissue sections at distinct spatial distributions within the histologic structures of the brain. Figure 2b shows representative 2D DESI-FAIMS ion images of selected protein ions. A distinct cluster of ions centered at m/z 707.068 (20+ charge state, MM = 14,211 Da), identified as myelin basic protein (MBP) isoform 8 was observed at higher relative abundances within the white matter of the brain, while unidentified protein ions at m/z 992.680 (8+ charge state) and m/z 985.265 (11+ charge state) were distributed throughout the tissue section. The relative abundance of alpha globin was higher in the outer portion of the mouse brain tissue sections, likely correlating to regions containing blood vessels and arteries.11 The spatial distribution of the protein ions detected was reproducible across multiple mouse brain tissue sections (Figure S7), and in agreement with what was previously reported by nanoDESI and LMJ-SSP.11,13 Further, multimodal DESI imaging was successfully performed to obtain both lipid and protein information from the same mouse brain tissue section by first imaging the tissue in negative ion mode for lipid analysis, followed by a lipid-washing step, and then positive ion mode protein analysis using the DESI-FAIMS system (for more information, please see Supporting Information and Figures S8–S10).</p><p>We next employed DESI-FAIMS to image proteins from human normal and cancer tissue sections. As shown in Figure 3a, the mass spectra obtained from normal ovarian and high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) tissue sections showed distinct relative abundances of protein ions. Hemoglobin β (m/z 1443.318; 11+ charge state; MM = 15 998 Da), for example, was observed at high relative abundances in healthy ovarian tissue samples, while the S100A6 protein (m/z 1442.339; 7+ charge state; MM = 10 180 Da), was observed at high relative abundances in HGSC tissue. Note that although differing by ~1 m/z value, hemoglobin β and S100A6 were clearly resolved in the mass spectra (Figure 3b) and identified using a top-down approach. Increased abundance of S100A6 has been previously reported in a variety of human cancers.18 DESI-FAIMS ion images enabled clear visualization of protein ions within the heterogeneous regions of a single tissue sample (Figure 3c), which corroborates with previous findings.13,19</p><p>DESI-FAIMS-MS imaging also allowed detection of several proteins from human normal and Her2-ductal carcinoma breast tissue samples (Figure 4). For example, profilin-1 at m/z 1 152.460 (13+ charge state, MM = 15 054 Da) and hemoglobin α at m/z 1 009.536 (15+ charge state) were observed at higher relative abundance in a normal breast tissue. On the other hand, S100 proteins including S100A4 at m/z 1058.893 (11+ charge state, MM = 11 279 Da), S100A8 at m/z 986.633 (11+ charge state, MM = 10 835 Da), and S100A11 at m/z 1 166.091 (10+ charge state, MM = 11 740 Da), were seen at higher relative abundances in breast cancer tissue (Figure 4b). Upregulation of members of the S100 family of proteins is known to occur in breast cancer and has been reported by MALDI-MS imaging and other techniques.20–22 Galectin-1 (m/z 1 126.177, 13+ charge state, MM = 14 716 Da), previously associated with Her2-cancer stromal tissue,23 was also detected by DESI-FAIMS-MS at higher relative abundances in the Her2-cancer tissue analyzed.</p><p>In conclusion, we describe the successful optimization of DESI for protein detection and further coupling to a FAIMS device for protein imaging directly from biological tissue sections. Addition of FAIMS at parameters optimized for protein transmission reduced the mass spectra noise and transmission of background ions, resulting in higher S/N of protein ions and thus improved imaging contrast and quality. We further demonstrate on-tissue top-down protein identification using UVPD and CID for identification of abundant protein ions detected by DESI-MS. While this study shows a noteworthy advancement for DESI-MS imaging, it represents an initial step toward in-depth tissue proteomics applications. Most protein species detected are highly abundant in biological tissues, such as hemoglobin and S100 proteins. Thus, additional optimization is needed to improve the desorption efficiency of lower abundant proteins. Although protein coverage by DESI-MS imaging remains vastly poorer to the coverage achieved through traditional LC–MS/MS of tissue extracts and MALDI-MS imaging workflows,24,25 the ability to rapidly image intact proteins from tissue sections with minimal sample preparation and under ambient conditions suggests DESI-MS as a promising tool for top-down proteomics, with potential applications in cancer imaging and diagnosis.</p>","answer":"Analysis of large biomolecules including proteins has proven challenging using ambient ionization mass spectrometry imaging techniques. Here, we have successfully optimized desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) to detect intact proteins directly from tissue sections and further integrated DESI-MS to a high field asymmetric waveform ion mobility (FAIMS) device for protein imaging. Optimized DESI-FAIMS-MS parameters were used to image mouse kidney, mouse brain, and human ovarian and breast tissue samples, allowing detection of 11, 16, 14, and 16 proteoforms, respectively. Identification of protein species detected by DESI-MS was performed on-tissue by top-down ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) and collision induced dissociation (CID) as well as using tissue extracts by bottom-up CID and top-down UVPD. Our results demonstrate that DESI-MS imaging is suitable for the analysis of the distribution of proteins within biological tissue sections."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Our purpose was to describe the clinical characteristics, mapping and ablation of these pathways. This was a retrospective study of all patients who underwent ablation of posteroseptal accessory pathways in a single centre. Patients with a diverticulum of the CS or one of its tributaries were included in group I, while the other patients formed group II. Clinical presentation, ablation procedure and outcome were compared between the two groups. A total of 51 patients were included, 16 in group I and 35 in group II. There were no significant differences in age or sex distribution. Atrial fibrillation (AF) and previous unsuccessful ablation were more common in group I. A negative delta wave in lead II was the ECG finding with best sensitivity and specificity for the presence of a diverticulum. A pathway potential was common at the successful site in group I, and the interval between local ventricular electrogram and delta wave onset was shorter (19.5 ± 8 vs 33.1 ± 7.6 ms, p < 0.001). There was a trend toward lower procedural success rate and higher recurrence rate in group I, although this was not significant. CS diverticula should be suspected in patients with manifest posteroseptal accessory pathways who have a previous failed ablation, documented AF or typical electrocardiographic signs. A discrete potential is frequently seen at the successful site, but the local ventricular electrogram is not as early as in other accessory pathways.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"accessory pathways\\", \\"coronary sinus (CS) diverticulum\\", \\"pathway\\", \\"coronary sinus diverticula\\", \\"Posteroseptal accessory pathways\\", \\"diverticulum of the CS\\", \\"CS diverticula\\", \\"posteroseptal accessory pathways\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"Atrial fibrillation\\", \\"diverticulum\\", \\"AF\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"delta wave\\", \\"finding\\", \\"electrocardiographic signs\\", \\"negative\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"ablation procedure\\", \\"ablation of these pathways\\", \\"Radiofrequency ablation\\", \\"ECG\\", \\"ablation\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"retrospective study\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"site\\", \\"single centre\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

eso @xcite . as a result , we have already come a long way from simple empirical models of the galaxy that fit star counts in a few lines of sight @xcite , to models that aim to be dynamically self - consistent .some of these models , such as , _ besanon _ , trilegal , and _ galaxia _ @xcite have been constructed to directly satisfy the observational constraints from various large scale photometric , astrometric and spectroscopic surveys of the milky way .however , to understand the milky way s formation history , and hence to further verify the models , it is important to know the fundamental properties of the stars , including radius and mass . until recently , it has been difficult to reliably determine these properties model - independently for large numbers of distant stars .fortunately , the space missions corot @xcite and _ kepler _ @xcite , and now also k2 @xcite , provide highly accurate time - series photometry of thousands of stars across the galaxy , from which we can obtain asteroseismic information that is sensitive to , and hence capable of measuring , stellar radius and mass in a largely model independent way .    a promising approach to take advantage of the large ensembles of seismically - inferred stellar properties is to invoke stellar population synthesis - based models of the milky way .this offers a way to link stellar structure and evolution with galactic structure and evolution by combining isochrones with star - formation history , the initial mass function , and the spatial distribution of stars of the galaxy .this allows one to predict stellar observables like temperature , photometry , asteroseismic parameters , as well as fundamental stellar properties such as radius and mass .@xcite used the first seven months of _ kepler _ data of dwarfs and subgiants , to compare the distributions of seismically - inferred radii and masses of about 400 stars with a synthesis - based galactic model using trilegal .they found that the radius distribution of the synthetic population matched the data , but the mass distribution significantly under - predicted the number of low - mass stars ( @xmath3 ) , and hence over - predicted the number of more massive ( younger ) stars .using red giants from _ kepler _ , we found the opposite effect when comparing the observed masses with predictions from the galactic model _we showed that in the _ kepler _ region for a magnitude limited sample , trilegal predicts more blue stars as compared to 2mass , while _ galaxia _ has no such problem .because blue stars are young and massive , this suggests that trilegal overpredicts the number of young and massive stars .hence , it is important to compare the observed masses of dwarfs and subgiants with the predictions from _ galaxia_.    besides inaccuracies in the galactic model , there are a number of other factors that could contribute to the mismatch in the mass distributions seen by @xcite .( i ) inaccuracies in the selection function can lead to a mismatch and need to be checked .there could be systematics associated with the algorithm used to estimate average seismic parameters .( ii ) the probability to detect oscillations can differ from one algorithm to another and this can lead to differences in the selection function . since the analysis by @xcite , a new data set of dwarfs and subgiants has been published by @xcite , which used a different algorithm to estimate the seismic parameters .additionally , it contains more stars and extends to slightly lower gravities .hence , it is necessary to investigate the mass distributions with the new data set as well .( iii ) theoretical modelling of the stellar oscillations predict departures from the @xmath2 scaling relation @xcite and the effect of this needs to be taken into account .( iv ) to estimate mass from average seismic parameters , one has to adopt certain solar reference values .currently , there is no consensus on the choice of these with systematic differences ranging from 1% to 2% .hence , one needs to investigate whether the discrepancy between observations and predictions is less or greater than the current diversity in the solar reference values .    in this paperwe revisit the dwarf / subgiant analysis of @xcite and analyze each of the above mentioned factors . in section 2 , we discuss the observational data and the galactic models .systematics associated with the different data sets and galactic models are discussed here . in section 3, we analyze the asteroseismic information for different data sets and different galactic models and discuss the role of the selection function .we also do a quantitative study of the difference between observed and predicted mass distributions . finally , in section 4 we discuss and conclude our findings .for the 290 stars in common between the chaplin-2014 and chaplin-2011 samples .( b ) same as panel ( a ) but for @xmath1 .the dashed line in panel ( b ) shows the ratio of @xmath4 adopted in chaplin-2014 to that adopted in chaplin-2011 .there is no systematic shift between the two methods .the standard deviation is of the order of the uncertainties on the estimated values of @xmath1 ( 4% ) and @xmath2 ( 2% ) .[ fig : c14_c11_nu],scaledwidth=46.0% ]      the observed asteroseismic information is in the form of the average seismic parameters @xmath2 ( average frequency spacing between overtone oscillation modes ) and @xmath1 ( frequency at maximum oscillation power ) that are extracted from time series photometry using a specific algorithm / method .prior to the launch of _ kepler _ , about 2000 stars with @xmath5 mag were selected as potential asteroseismic dwarf and subgiant targets based on their parameters in the kepler input catalog ( kic ) @xcite .they were all observed with short cadence for one month each during an initial 10-month seismic survey phase .four hundred stars showed detectable oscillations after the first seven months and were presented by @xcite ( hereafter denoted as chaplin-11 sample ) .following the completion of the 10-month survey , an updated dwarf / subgiant sample ( 518 stars ) showing oscillations was presented by @xcite ( here after denoted as chaplin-14 sample ) , where a method different from that of @xcite was used for extracting seismic parameters . in the chaplin-14 sample467 stars have measured values of @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath6 . of these , 290 stars are in common with the previous chaplin-11 sample . in , we compare the @xmath2 and @xmath1 values of chaplin-2014 with those of chaplin-2011 , for stars common to both samples .it can be seen that there are no systematic shift between the two data sets .this means there is no method - specific differences in the two data sets . in this paperwe mainly make use of the chaplin-2014 sample , because it has more stars .the stellar mass and radius can be estimated from the seismic parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 , and the effective temperature @xmath7 using the following scaling relations : [ equ : scaling_m ] & = & ( ) ^3()^-4()^1.5 + [ equ : scaling_r ] & = & ( ) ( ) ^-2()^0.5 .these relations are based on the relations @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , which in turn are based on the assumption that the structure of any given star is homologous with respect to the sun .this assumption is not strictly correct and can lead to departures from the scaling relations . to accommodate these departures we have introduced the factors @xmath10 and @xmath11 .there is also considerable uncertainty regarding the choice of solar reference values and this leads to uncertainties in @xmath10 and @xmath12 , when we adopt a specific set of canonical solar reference values .below , we discuss this in detail ..solar reference values for different methods of computing average seismic parameters .[ cols=\\"<,<,<\\",options=\\"header \\" , ]     [ tab : tb2 ]     scaling relation are applied .the corrections were computed assuming solar metallicity ( @xmath13 ) for all the observed stars .[ fig : galaxia_trilegal_fm_sigmam2],scaledwidth=47.0% ]    in , we compare the predicted mass distributions with observations , for the three different selection functions , s0 , s1 and s2 . compared to the observed distributions , the predicted distributions are shifted toward lower masses and are slightly broader .for s0 the shift is minimal , but for s1 and s2 it is significant .we note that a ( s0 ) is the same as a. to quantify the shift between the mass distributions , we determined the value of @xmath10 that minimizes the kolmogorov - smirnov statistic between the observed and predicted distributions .the uncertainty on the estimate was computed using bootstrapping .the results are shown in .the two selection functions ( s1 and s2 ) that are based on observables like gravity and temperature , give similar values for @xmath10 , but the value is different for s0 .it is clear that the selection function plays a crucial role and can bias @xmath10 by 2% .the difference between trilegal and _ galaxia _ is also about 2% .detailed theoretical modelling of oscillations shows that there are departures from the @xmath2 scaling relation that depend upon metallicity , mass , and age .as mentioned in , we accommodated these departures using the correction factor @xmath14 .we computed these corrections using the publicly available code asfgrid .asfgrid uses the code mesa ( v6950 ) @xcite for stellar evolution and the code gyre @xcite for deriving oscillation frequencies .the correction factors are computed as a function of metallicity , mass , and age , see @xcite for further details .applying these corrections makes the observed mass distribution narrower ( blue lines in ) .this is expected because for the stars that we study , the mean mass of a star increases with temperature and the correction factor decreases with temperature .the combined effect is that for high - mass stars , the mass decreases , and for low - mass stars , the mass increases .this leads to narrowing of the overall distribution .computing corrections requires metallicity , and we adopted the spectroscopic metallicities reported by @xcite . instead of applying the correction to the observed stars, we can also apply the reciprocal correction to the synthetic stars whose metallicity is known exactly .doing so had negligible effect on the values quoted in ( see results in square brackets ) .we have compared the asteroseismic properties of dwarfs and subgiants observed by kepler against predictions of two population synthesis models of the galaxy , trilegal and _ galaxia_. the previous study by @xcite using trilegal found that stellar population synthesis based models overestimated the number of high - mass stars , which we are able to reproduce .we identified three potential factors that can shift the model mass distributions toward higher masses relative to the observed masses .first , trilegal most likely overpredicts the number of young massive stars as it fails to match the @xmath15 color distribution of stars in 2mass @xcite .second , we found that a choice of @xmath4 that is 2% lower than that adopted by @xcite , which is equally valid given the uncertainty in the actual value , can increase the observed masses by about 6% .finally , we found that if a selection function based on oscillation amplitudes is used , the galactic models can not reproduce the distribution of the observed sample in @xmath16 space .this might be due to inaccuracies in the model , but could also be due to inaccuracies in the assumed selection function . selecting the synthetic stars to satisfy the distribution in @xmath0 space removed this bias but shifted the model mass distribution to lower masses ( b , c ) .the bias due to the mismatch of the color distribution can be corrected by using a model such as _ galaxia _ , which does not show such a mismatch .the bias due to inaccuracies in the selection function based on oscillation amplitudes can be reduced by using a selection function based on @xmath17 and @xmath7 of the observed sample . doing so , we find that the mass distribution of _ galaxia _ is shifted toward lower masses and is also slightly broader compared to the observed distribution .a similar effect was also seen for the _ kepler _ red giant sample @xcite , so the underlying cause might be the same . applying corrections to the @xmath2 scaling relation predicted by stellar models makes the observed mass distribution narrower than observed but does not change the mean .the disagreement in the mass distributions reported here , translates to about 2% change in @xmath18 , which is comparable to the current uncertainty in the @xmath1 scaling relation . in future, we need to verify the scaling relations to better than 2% to put better constraints on the galactic models .    however , _ galaxia_ failed to match the distribution of observed stars in @xmath17 and @xmath7 space .this also needs to be investigated in future .the mismatch at high @xmath7 could be due to inaccuracies in predicting oscillation amplitudes because the detection probability of a star in this region is sensitive to its assumed amplitude .however , the mismatch at low @xmath6 is most likely due to inaccuracies in the model , because here we expect the detection probability to be close to 1 .parallaxes , and hence luminosities , from gaia will help resolve this issue because luminosity correlates with gravity .we acknowledge the support of _ galactic archaeology and precision stellar astrophysics _ program organized by kavli institute for theoretical physics ( national science foundation grant no .nsf phy11 -

Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: As of January 30, 2020, there have been at least 9,776 persons infected and 213 verified deaths. 2 These numbers are likely underestimates due to the limited information available regarding incubation time, transmissibility, and virus origin. The What was the research question? Investigators adapted the \\"Identify, Isolate, Inform\\" (3I) Tool for use in suspected cases of 2019-nCoV. What was the major finding of the study? A novel 2019-nCoV 3I Tool is designed for frontline clinicians in the management of suspected patients. This 2019-nCoV 3I adaptation will aid healthcare providers most likely to encounter the disease in the containment and effective treatment of patients. age distribution of these verified deaths is currently not available. One preliminary, small-scale study of 41 patients in Wuhan China, reported 6 deaths (15% mortality) with a median age of 49.0 years. 5 Additionally, transmission of the virus has reportedly occurred in healthcare facilities in Wuhan City, raising concerns of spread to healthcare workers, as was seen during prior outbreaks of the novel coronaviruses, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Due to the dynamic nature of the outbreak, exposure criteria may change depending on where new cases of 2019-nCoV are detected, the degree of transmissibility, and when additional information regarding the origin of the virus is discovered and reported. On January 15, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the first known imported case of 2019-nCoV in the US state of Washington. The patient had recently returned from Wuhan City, where he likely contracted the disease. Chicago health authorities reported a second US case on January 24, 2020. This was quickly followed by additional imported cases reported in Orange and Los Angeles Counties, California on January 26, 2020. Additional suspected cases continue to be evaluated. On January 30, 2020, the CDC reported the first local transmission in the US between members in a household. On the same day, the World Health Organization declared 2019-nCoV to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). 6 On January 31, 2020, the US Department of Health and Human Services declared coronavirus a public health emergency. 7 Healthy individuals and those with mild illness may be asymptomatic, while others may have more pronounced symptoms of fever or lower respiratory illness. Upon identification of a suspected patient, that individual should immediately be isolated with airborne precautions. Further workup and laboratory confirmation can then proceed. Emergency physicians (EPs), emergency medical services (EMS) personnel, and other healthcare workers who encounter patients with suspected 2019-nCoV infection must inform the appropriate authorities, including but not limited to hospital infection control and local or state public health agencies. Healthcare workers must follow on-going developments related to the outbreak, especially new information concerning detection and management. 8, 9 The 3I Tool outlined in this paper is consistent with current US CDC guidelines and can be applied in a variety of settings such as those in emergency departments, urgent-care clinics, physicians\' offices, and prehospital settings. This paper will first briefly review 2019-nCoV and then present the novel 2019-nCoV 3I Tool as modified from its initial conception for Ebola virus disease 10,11 and later adapted for measles, 12 MERS, 13 mumps, 14 Zika virus disease, 15 hepatitis A, 16 pertussis, 17 and scabies. 18 Coronavirus 2019-nCoV infection commonly presents with signs and symptoms of pneumonia or as a nonspecific lower respiratory illness, with coughing or difficulty breathing accompanied by fever. 5, 19, 20 Fever and cough constitute the most common presentations. However, patients may have other respiratory symptoms, sore throat, nasal congestion, malaise, myalgia, and headache. Bilateral infiltrates may be seen on chest X-ray. Severe cases may present with sepsis and even shock. Conversely, some patients may present as only mildly ill or asymptomatic altogether. 21 To date, patients with underlying medical conditions and the elderly  are more likely to become severely ill, require hospitalization, and ultimately die. 22 Early predictions for incubation time are between 2 and 14 days, based on data from similar coronaviruses. The 14-day criterion for epidemiological risk assumes the longest estimated incubation time. 23 In addition, the World Health Organization (WHO) has created its own interim case definition. 24By definition, the main features of a novel virus, for example, how it is transmitted, will not be immediately known. However, as with the development of any 3I Tool, it is essential to understand specific characteristics of the disease. In the case of a novel virus such as 2019-CoV, this is challenging since information is rapidly evolving and the science is not yet fully understood. It is possible that the virus will undergo mutations over time that could substantially change itsThe Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool Applied to a Novel Emerging Coronavirus Koenig et al. features. Nevertheless, an appreciation of the key concepts that drive evidence-based management is beneficial (Table 1) . Management guidance will likely change over time. With the initial discovery of a new potential public health threat, it will likely be unclear how patients become sick. For example, rather than a contagion, there could be a contaminant or a toxin responsible for signs and symptoms. In this case, the possibility of an environmental toxin in the Wuhan Market was a consideration early on when limited to no human-tohuman transmission was reported. The mode of transmission has implications for the types of personal protective equipment (PPE) needed to protect healthcare providers in the prehospital, clinic, and hospital settings. 25 In addition, patients may need decontamination after exposure to certain toxins. 26 Another important consideration for application of the 3I Tool is whether the disease is contagious prior to symptom onset (like measles) or only after symptoms develop (like Ebola). A January 30, 2020 letter to the New England Journal of Medicine describes a purported confirmed instance of transmission from an asymptomatic individual. Researchers state that, before symptom onset, the primary case infected two individuals, one of which infected two additional colleagues. 27 Subsequent investigation suggested that the source patient did have mild symptoms and had taken an antipyretic, calling this reported asymptomatic transmission into question. While quarantine may not be feasible and can have unintended consequences, 28, 29, 30 it is a public health tool that can be considered in cases when disease is transmissible before symptom onset. 30 Conversely, if a disease is known not to be transmissible prior to symptom onset, asymptomatic exposed patients must be monitored, but do not require quarantine or isolation unless they develop symptoms. Initially, it may be unclear whether an infectious agent occurred naturally or was deliberately or accidentally released. In this case, a BSL-4 laboratory studying coronaviruses was located approximately 32 kilometers away from the market where initial exposures were felt to occur. 31 Recall that in 2001, the anthrax letter attacks were initially thought to be naturally occurring. Once determined to be bioterrorism, management of the event was similar to that for a chemical exposure with a sudden impact, defined scene, and need for a rapid response and decontamination on site. This differed from the WHO\'s modeling predicting an aerosolized release that would result in an incubation period with 100,000 or more persons exposed rather than the 22 people who contracted anthrax in 2001. 32 By understanding the key features of a novel disease, healthcare workers can take evidence-based measures to protect themselves, optimize individual patient management, and prevent further disease spread. It is currently unclear how 2019-nCoV is spread, but it is suspected to be transmitted through contact with infected respiratory secretions, like other known coronaviruses. There are instances of sustained human-to-human transmission across generations of cases, especially near the epicenter in Wuhan City. 21 Current evidence suggests that close contact with an infected person is a major factor in disease transmission. CDC defines \\"close contact\\" 33 as being in or within two meters of an area with a confirmed patient or being directly exposed to infectious secretions without appropriate PPE. Healthcare facilities in China have reported spread from person to person. In addition, some mildly ill or potentially even asymptomatic patients may have a higher chance of spreading the disease to others as they may be less likely to seek medical care. 34 The possibility that patients may be infectious prior to symptom onset further compounds the difficulty of containing the virus and effectively preventing transmission. The current majority of 2019-nCoV cases have been within China and its bordering countries. 2 Persons with recent travel (within 14 days) to Wuhan City or another region with widespread disease, or exposure to a patient under investigation, are considered to have an epidemiologic risk factor and should be assessed for signs and symptoms of a viral illness such as fever and respiratory symptoms. Coronavirus is a zoonotic virusThe Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool Applied to a Novel Emerging Coronavirus that is transmitted to humans via contact with infected animals. Preliminary reports suggest the disease may have originated in a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan City, but it is still unknown how or whether such transmission occurred. Clinicians working with local public health departments must arrange to have specimens from patients under investigation (PUIs) sent to the CDC laboratory. At this time, the CDC has the only laboratory that can definitively test for 2019-nCoV, though laboratory testing capacity is being rapidly expanded. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays conducted on samples from a patient\'s upper and lower respiratory tracts will be used to confirm potential cases. In addition, serum antibody titers can be analyzed for confirmation of infection or evidence of immunity. Up-to-date information about the needed specimens and handling requirements to test for 2019-nCoV are available on the CDC website. 35Like other related coronaviruses, patients with 2019-nCoV frequently present with non-specific symptoms resembling that of influenza. Physicians may consider differential diagnoses related to a wide variety of respiratory infections. In order to relate these symptoms to 2019-nCoV, it is imperative that the identification of a potential exposure event (epidemiologic risk factor) within 14 days of symptom onset is made so that a more focused work-up for 2019-nCoV can be completed. Although the likelihood of coinfection of 2019-nCoV and another respiratory virus is thought to be low, a positive finding of another respiratory pathogen does not exclude the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV. Many commercially available respiratory panels include \\"coronavirus\\" in the results, but neither a positive nor a negative finding on these panels should be used to include or exclude a diagnosis of 2019-nCoV. Supportive care with appropriate infection control is the mainstay of current CDC treatment guidelines for 2019-nCoV. There are not yet any approved antiviral treatments for 2019-nCoV. Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) for compassionate use cases may be forthcoming from the US federal government for normally unapproved treatments. Supportive treatment predominantly includes respiratory support, hydration, and antipyretics. General treatment for severe cases should focus on the preservation of vital organ function. In the future, antiviral medications may be available. If a secondary bacterial infection such as pneumonia develops, targeted antibiotics are indicated. Prevention of 2019-nCoV transmission, like any other infectious agent, involves minimizing risk of exposure. Vaccines are under accelerated development and may be useful in the future for post-exposure prophylaxis. Healthcare personnel are at increased risk and should practice standard, droplet, and airborne precautions when encountering an infected person, a PUI, or any symptomatic close contacts. Healthcare workers handling specimens should also adhere to CDC guidelines and should not attempt to perform any virus isolation or characterization. Fever screening has been implemented at numerous airports, including major international hubs within Asia and the US. The efficacy of this intervention is not well documented, however, as some infected persons may be afebrile and disease transmission might occur prior to symptom onset. 27 In addition, people can artificially lower their temperature readings, e.g., by applying ice to their foreheads. As outlined above, admission criteria for 2019-nCoV are similar to that of other patients. If patients do not meet medical criteria for hospitalization, they may be discharged home with isolation precautions and continued observation. EPs must notify local public health authorities so appropriate monitoring and community protective measures can be instituted. The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool was initially developed for Ebola virus disease 10,11 and later adapted for measles, 12 MERS, 13 mumps, 14 Zika virus disease, 15 hepatitis A, 16 pertussis, 17 and scabies. 18 This novel tool for suspected 2019-nCoV patients ( Figure 1 ) provides frontline clinicians with a simple algorithm to manage an emerging disease. Identification of exposed patients with an epidemiologic risk factor within 14 days of symptom onset is a crucial first step. An automatic prompt in the electronic health record can be useful in assisting clinicians with early identification of patients at risk. Case definitions promulgated by the WHO 24 and CDC 33 provide useful comprehensive definitions that have been incorporated into the 3I Tool. The 2019-nCoV Tool provides an accurate, summarized algorithm to immediately, and effectively manage suspected patients until additional resources can be consulted. Patients who do not have an exposure risk or any symptoms may be triaged normally. However, before making patient contact, providers must first apply the Vital Sign Zero concept. 36 Vital Sign Zero is a preliminary, non-contact assessment (i.e., performed prior to touching a patient to take traditional vital signs) to first determine whether specific PPE is indicated before the examination commences. By taking the additional time to complete this assessment, risk of exposure and further transmission can be minimized. while in the treatment facility should be started and maintained to assist with the possibility of contact tracing. Following isolation, physicians should immediately inform the appropriate authorities. Patients who do not meet medical criteria for admission can be isolated at home during the evaluation phase. 37 Health department officials can help prevent transmission in isolated patients by providing in-home monitoring and implementing appropriate exposure-control measures. Providers in the prehospital setting who have a high likelihood of encountering 2019-nCoV patients, such as those near international ports of entry, should adhere to established exposure control guidelines. 38 Along with appropriate PPE, providers should also carry thermometers to quantify any fever. In the US, providers should contact the appropriate CDC quarantine station upon isolation of infected or suspected patients, especially those from Wuhan, China or other regions with widespread disease, who report symptoms in the last 14 days. As for other infectious diseases, assessing travel history is essential.Question: What symptoms might people experience with COVID19?","answer":"patients with underlying medical conditions and the elderly"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal historically has been treated with abdominoperineal resection, resulting in high rates of morbidity and local recurrence. Pioneering work led to the finding that radiation therapy (RT) combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin results in high rates of local control and disease-free and colostomy-free survival without surgery. Prospective randomized trials from Europe and the United States have shown the superiority of RT, 5-FU, and mitomycin over 1) RT alone, 2) RT with 5-FU, and 3) neoadjuvant cisplatin/5-FU with concurrent radiation, cisplatin, and 5-FU. At present, RT with 5-FU and mitomycin is the standard of care for anal cancer patients. Recent advances include the integration of positron emission tomography into staging, radiation treatment planning and monitoring, and the use of intensity modulated RT. European randomized trials are further evaluating the role of cisplatin in the neoadjuvant, concurrent, and adjuvant settings, as well as radiation dose escalation.

Here is how you can achieve that:1. Start with a div container with a position relative. This makes the container a reference point for absolute positioning within it.```html<div style=\\"position: relative;\\"></div>```2. Now, place your first SVG inside this div. SVG will take the full width and height of the div.```html<div style=\\"position: relative;\\">  <svg style=\\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;\\" width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" viewBox=\\"0 0 32 32\\" xmlns=\\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\">    <path d=\\"Your svg path here...\\"/>  </svg></div>```3. Now, repeat step 2 for all the SVGs you want to add. Just remember to keep the styles same for all SVGs that is position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0. This will force all SVGs to occupy the same space and hence, they will be layered over one another.```html<div style=\\"position: relative;\\">  <svg style=\\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;\\" width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" viewBox=\\"0 0 32 32\\" xmlns=\\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\">    <path d=\\"Your first svg path here...\\"/>  </svg>  <svg style=\\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;\\" width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"100%\\" viewBox=\\"0 0 32 32\\" xmlns=\\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\">    <path d=\\"Your second svg path here...\\"/>  </svg>  <!-- Place your other SVGs in the same manner --></div>```4. Adjust the z-index property to manage their stacking order if needed.5. Using CSS opacity property, you can make one SVG partially transparent to reveal the other SVG behind it, creating a composite image.This will give you an overall composite image where all the different SVG elements overlay one another. You can further experiment with this and adjust the heights, widths, colors and SVG paths to your liking."},{"question":"Design and implement a Python function that will convert any given decimal number into binary form.

For integers, it uses standard method to convert decimal to binary, and uses two\'s complement for negative numbers.Please note this code doesn\'t handle cases where the floating point number has more than 23 fractional binary digits. Also, it doesn\'t handle very large or very small numbers which would fall outside the range allowed by the IEEE 754 32-bit standard format.

The value of `result` is calculated by multiplying `base` by itself `power` number of times. As such, starting with `result` equal to `base` as in the original code actually calculates the value of `base` raised to the power of `power + 1`.Now, to create a separate function that can handle any two integers for exponent calculation:```javapublic class Main {    public static void main(String [] args) {        System.out.println(calculatePower(3, 4)); // Output: 81        System.out.println(calculatePower(5, -2)); // Output: 0.04    }    public static double calculatePower(int base, int power) {        double result = 1;        if(power < 0) {            for(int i = 1; i <= -power; i++) {                result = result / base;            }        }        else {            for(int i = 1; i <= power; i++) {                result = result * base;            }        }        return result;    }}```If the exponent is less than zero, the `calculatePower` function calculates the reciprocal of the base raised to the power of the absolute value of the exponent. If the exponent is zero, the result is 1 regardless of the base (except if the base is also 0, in which case the result is undefined). If the exponent is greater than zero, the function calculates the base raised to the power of the exponent."},{"question":"Generate a random 24-character password strength string with an even distribution of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and non-alphanumeric characters.

We initialize an empty array `numArray`.2. We use a loop that runs ten times (`for(let i=0; i<10; i++)`).3. Inside the loop, we generate a random number between 0 and 100 using `Math.random() * 100`. The `Math.floor()` function is used to ensure we get an integer.4. This random number is then added to the end of the array using `numArray.push()`.5. Once the loop has run ten times, the `numArray` array will contain ten randomly generated integers.6. Finally, we print out the array to the console using `console.log()`.Please note that `Math.random()` generates a random decimal number in [0, 1). If you need a whole number in a specific range, appropriate adjustments should be made. The code above generates random whole numbers in [0, 100)."},{"question":"Provided with a set of two positive whole numbers, along with an optional third number, execute the calculation to determine the Smallest Common Multiple (also known as LCM) of all numbers. The third number must also be considered in the calculation if provided. primary_whole_number = 15secondary_whole_number = 10optional_third_number = 8","answer":"You can solve this problem by defining a helper function `get_lcm(a,b)` which calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b`. After that, you can use this function to get the LCM of three numbers using the formula `lcm(a,b,c)=lcm(a, lcm(b,c))`.Here is a Python solution:```pythondef gcd(x, y):    \\"\\"\\"Computes the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers\\"\\"\\"    while(y):        x, y = y, x % y    return x        def get_lcm(a, b):    \\"\\"\\"Computes the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers\\"\\"\\"    return a * b // gcd(a, b)primary_whole_number = 15secondary_whole_number = 10optional_third_number = 8lcm = get_lcm(primary_whole_number, secondary_whole_number)lcm = get_lcm(lcm, optional_third_number)print(f\\"nThe least common multiple of {primary_whole_number}, {secondary_whole_number} and {optional_third_number} is {lcm}n\\")```Output: ```The least common multiple of 15, 10 and 8 is 120```In this program, `gcd(x, y)` and `get_lcm(a, b)` are helper functions to calculate GCD and LCM of two numbers respectively. After that, we calculate the LCM of `primary_whole_number` and `secondary_whole_number` first, and then get the LCM of the result and `optional_third_number`. This result is the LCM of all three numbers."},{"question":"Develop a Python program that calculates the number of vowels, consonants, and non-alphabetical characters in a given string.

It also calculates the frequency of each vowel and consonant. The string is converted to lowercase before processing to make counts case-insensitive. If any error or unusual input is encountered, the program will catch the exception and print an error message."},{"question":"How would you implement a webhook using Flask that receives data from one API call and triggers two or more other API calls concurrently?

We then execute these functions on a list of numbers, in this case `[2, 3, 6, 5]`.Keep in mind that the `mode()` function returns only a single mode. In a list that includes more than one mode (bimodal, multimodal), this function will only return one of the modes.In the `histogram()` function, we are using `matplotlib.pyplot` to plot the histogram. It is necessary to have the matplotlib library to display histogram. The `bins` parameter, along with `range`, is used to define the number of bins and the range of the bins (from the smallest to the greatest number), and `edgecolor` sets the color of the lines between the bars. The function `plt.xticks(range(0, max(numbers)+1))` sets the x-axis ticks to be every integer value within the range of `numbers`.Note: Make sure you have installed matplotlib library in your python environment.

Now, let\'s define another function M(n,k), which signifies the highest value of d(j) within the range n le j le n+k-1.

Hence, to overcome this problem, we need to follow a more mathematical and strategic rather than brute-force approach.Starting with a sieve kind of technique, we first create an array from 1 to \'u\'. This array will hold the divisor count (d(n)) for each number \'n\'. In the next step, we slide a window of size \'k\' over this array to keep track of the maximum divisor count within the current window (which is actually the calculation for M(n,k)). As we are sliding over, we keep adding these maximum values to obtain the final value of S(u,k).So, for calculating S(100,000,000, 100,000) we should better to run it in an environment with high computational power due to the large scale of the numbers. Here is a python code for that:```pythondef calculate_S_u_k(u, k):    n = [1] * (u + 1)    for i in range(2, u + 1):        for j in range(i, u + 1, i):            n[j] += 1    maximum = 0    for i in range(k):        if n[i] > maximum:            maximum = n[i]    s = maximum    for i in range(k, u + 1):        if n[i] > maximum:            maximum = n[i]        s += maximum    return su = 100000000k = 100000print(calculate_S_u_k(u, k))```This code cannot be executed on standard computer due to memory constraints, but it can be run on a high-performance computer or cluster with ample memory.NOTE: This code can be optimized by breaking early from inner loop and recognizing repeated patterns. A more efficient algorithm also can be developed using dynamic programming but all these optimizations are beyond the scope of this problem."},{"question":"Design a Python function that not only identifies the inaugural singular character within a provided character string, but also determines the last singular character, both subsequently returning their corresponding index positions.

Then `split_data[1]` is used to get the second piece (note that Python list indices start from 0, so 1 is the second element).If backslashes are double as in your example string, you should use four backslashes `` in the split function.Hope this helps!"},{"question":"Write a code snippet in JavaScript to get the first element of an array.

If it is, it calls the function again on that array. If the first element is not an array, it simply returns that element. This will continue until it hits a non-array element, which will then be returned as the first non-array element of the nested structure.Please note: This function assumes that the arrays are not empty as per your specification.

Furthermore, could you identify specific elements that require careful scrutiny during this operation to boost efficiency and strengthen data protection, especially concerning data transfer, indexing, and encryption? Could you also underscore any possible intricacies or subtleties that might surface during this endeavor and propose tactics to alleviate them?","answer":"Database migration from MongoDB to Amazon DynamoDB requires detailed planning, as the entire process involves understanding the data model, indexing, creating tables, data transfer, and encryption.Here are the step-by-step procedures for the migration:1. Analyze the MongoDB Database:Analyze the data model in your MongoDB database. Note that MongoDB uses a flexible schema that may pose challenges when moving data to DynamoDB, which utilizes a different data model. You might have to transform your data to match the DynamoDB data model.2. Create DynamoDB Tables: DynamoDB is a NoSQL key-value store. Design the primary key and indexes for each DynamoDB table that will store your MongoDB data. Primary key selection is important as DynamoDB distributes data across multiple partitions based on this key. For efficient querying, you should design table indexes. 3. Data Transfer:Build a pipeline for converting and transferring MongoDB data to DynamoDB. AWS provides Data Pipeline to automate the data transfer but you may need to write custom scripts to transform the data during the process.4. Enable Encryption:Enable encryption at rest to increase data protection. AWS DynamoDB uses KMS (Key Management Service) for this. You can use AWS owned keys or your own KMS keys.5. Replication and Backup:Enable point-in-time-recovery (PITR) for data protection. This feature automatically creates a continuous backup of your data. DynamoDB also provides global tables feature for data replication across regions.6. Performance Tuning:AWS DynamoDB auto scaling should be enabled to manage table capacity efficiently. In DynamoDB, you must provision read and write capacity; auto scaling helps manage this provisioning effectively.Things to consider during the migration:1. Data Consistency:Be careful with data consistency during the transfer. You need to ensure that all data in MongoDB moves to DynamoDB without data loss.2. Indexing:DynamoDB supports two types of indexes: local secondary indexes (LSI) and global secondary indexes (GSI). Plan your indexes properly for efficient access of data.3. Costs:Monitor the migration closely. Transferring a lot of data from MongoDB to DynamoDB could lead to higher costs, so it\'s crucial to plan and schedule your data migration tasks wisely.Some intricacies that might surface:1. Nested Documents: MongoDB supports complex nested documents which is not natively supported in DynamoDB. You\'ll need to flatten these documents for DynamoDB.2. Different Data Types:MongoDB and DynamoDB support different data types. This could lead to issues during data movement and require a transformation.3. Throttling in DynamoDB:During data upload, there might be chances of throttling in DynamoDB if the write capacity is not efficiently allocated.To alleviate these issues:1. Pipeline Verification: Regularly verify the data pipeline for data consistency.2. Regular Monitoring: Monitor the write capacity to avoid throttling. Use auto-scaling for this.3. Use DynamoDB Time to Live (TTL) feature for automatically deleting old data, which could help manage costs.4. Data Conversion: Use AWS Glue for data conversion tasks. It\'s a serverless ETL service which can be helpful in transforming and loading data. Remember to test your applications with the new DynamoDB database, to ensure that they work as expected."},{"question":"Reimplement the Fibonacci sequence taking into consideration only odd indexed elements from a tuple.The Fibonacci sequence is defined by Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2, where F0 = 0 and F1 = 1.Start your sequence from F1 (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, …)Given a tuple \'colors\' as follows -colors = (\'red\', \'blue\', \'green\', \'yellow\', \'purple\', \'orange\', \'pink\')Extract every 3rd value (considering \'red\' as the 1st value) from the \'colors\' tuple, up to the nth Fibonacci number where n is the length of the tuple\'s Fibonacci sequence that does not exceed the total length of the tuple.

Inside the main part of the program, it creates the `colors` tuple and generates a filtered Fibonacci sequence that only includes the odd-indexed numbers. In the end, it filters the \'colors\' tuple based on the indices that are present in the filtered Fibonacci sequence, and prints the selected colors: \'green\', \'pink\'. Here \'green\' is the 3rd item (2nd index) and \'pink\' is the 6th item (5th index) in the \'colors\' tuple, which are the respective indexes in the Fibonacci sequence (using zero-based indexing).Please note that \'green\' is not the third fibonacci number. And \'pink\' is not the sixth fibonacci number. But they are the colors at the indexes equal to the values of fibonacci sequence with odd indexes. Also, it is taken in consideration that for a zero-based indexed tuple, the index 2 corresponds to the 1st index in Fibonacci sequence (starting from 2nd Fibonacci number). Similarly, 5 corresponds to the 3rd index in Fibonacci sequence (also starting from 2nd Fibonacci number).

Sieboldine A contains an unprecedented N-hydroxyazacyclononane ring embedded in a bicyclo[5.2.1]decane-N,O-acetal. To our knowledge, these functional group arrays were not only previously unknown in natural products, but in the chemical literature as a whole. We report herein the first total synthesis of (+)-sieboldine A (1).</p><p>Our retrosynthetic plan for preparing sieboldine A (1) is outlined in Scheme 1. The bicyclo[5.2.1]decane-N,O-acetal was expected to be sensitive, so we chose to fashion the N-hydroxyazacyclononane ring last by the coupling of a tethered hydroxylamine with a five-membered lactol or derivative.4 The cis-hydrindanone core 3 was seen arising from a pinacol-terminated cyclization cascade.5,6</p><p>The enantiomerically pure cis-hydrindanone intermediate 12 was assembled in ten steps from readily available tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]furan-2-one 5 (>99:1 er) (Scheme 2).7 Methylcuprate-promoted SN2´ anti-opening of 5 and iodolactonization, as described by Curran for the racemate,8 provided hexahydrocyclopentafuranone 6 in 93% yield (Scheme 2). Slow addition of this intermediate to a slurry of LiAlH4 in refluxing THF afforded diol 7.9 Selective protection of the primary alcohol of 7, followed by Dess–Martin oxidation yielded (2S,4R)-cyclopentanone 8. Conversion of (E)-vinyl iodide 910,11 to the corresponding lithium reagent, addition of this species to a THF slurry of CeCl3·2LiCl, and addition of cyclopentanone 8 (all at −78 °C) delivered a single allylic alcohol product in 90% yield. Silylation of this intermediate with triethylsilyl triflate (TESOTf) delivered bis(triethylsilyl)ether 10 in 59% overall yield from cyclopentafuranone 5.</p><p>Orchestrating an efficient cyclization-pinacol sequence to deliver a cis-hydrindanone intermediate proved challenging. In early experiments, we discovered that standard Prins-pinacol reactions5 of the dimethyl acetal analog of 10 [CH(OMe)2 in place of CH2OTES] yielded the corresponding cis-hydrindanone12 in <45% yield. As a result, we turned to the related pinacol-terminated 1,6-enyne cyclization reaction reported recently by Kirsch and Rhee.6 The cyclization precursor 11 was readily prepared in 77% overall yield from 10 by Swern oxidation of the primary silyl ether,13 followed by condensation of the resulting aldehyde with the Ohira–Bestmann reagent.14 Exposure of enyne 11 at room temperature in CH2Cl2 to the cationic gold(I) catalyst described by Kirsch6b produced cis-hydrindanone 12 in 78% yield as a single stereoisomer.</p><p>The sequence that we developed after much experimentation for elaborating hydrindanone 12 to (+)-sieboldine A (1) is summarized in Scheme 3. Cleavage of the exomethylene group of 12 with ozone, followed by base-promoted elimination of phenoxide provided enone 13. A europium(III)-catalyzed cyclocondensation of this intermediate with ethyl vinyl ether15 gave tricyclic dihydropyran 14 in 65% overall yield from precursor 12. After establishing that the C13 carbonyl group would require protection during the cyclization to form the N-hydroxyazacyclononane ring,16 ketone 14 was reduced with DIBALH to provide axial alcohol 15. Facial selective oxidation of this intermediate with dimethyldioxirane (DMDO), followed by exposure of the crude product to BF3·OEt2 and EtSH gave rise to thioglycoside 16 in 53% overall yield from 14.</p><p>The final N-hydroxyazacyclononane ring was fashioned as follows. Removal of the TBDPS group from intermediate 16,17 Mitsunobu coupling18 of the resulting primary alcohol with N-Ns-O-MOM hydroxylamine (17), and removal of the Ns-group under conventional conditions,19 afforded the O-(methoxy)methyl (MOM)-protected hydroxylamine cyclization precursor 18. Exposure of 18 to dimethyl(methylthio)sulfonium triflate (DMTST)20 in the presence of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine (DTBMP) at −20 °C in acetonitrile provided pentacyclic product 19 in 51% yield.21 Reintroduction of the C13 carbonyl group by TPAP (Pr4N+RuO4−)-catalyzed oxidation proved uneventful.22 The MOM protecting group was removed from the diketone product by reaction with an excess of Me2BBr in CH2Cl2 at 0 °C to deliver (+)-sieboldine A (1) in 67% yield. Synthetic sieboldine A (1), [α]23D +141 (c 0.4, MeOH), exhibited 1H and 13C NMR spectra indistinguishable from those reported for the natural isolate.1,23</p><p>In summary, the first total synthesis of (+)-sieboldine A was accomplished in 20 steps from (3aS,6aR)-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]furan-2-one 5. Our construction of the cis-hydrindanone intermediate using Au(I)-catalyzed activation of an alkyne to promote a cyclization-pinacol sequence,6 rather than Lewis acid-activation of an acetal,5 illustrates the potential advantages in demanding contexts of this mild catalytic procedure. Of particular note was the surprisingly efficient cyclization to form the unprecedented N-hydroxyazacyclononane ring from a thioglycoside precursor.</p><p>a (a) MeMgBr, CuBr·SMe2, THF:SMe2 (4:1), −20 °C; (b) KI, I2, NaHCO3, THF, H2O (93% over 2 steps); (c) LiAlH4, THF, reflux (83%); (d) TESCl, 2,6-lutidine, CH2Cl2, −78 °C (98%); (e) Dess–Martin periodinane, CH2Cl2 (97%); (f) i.

We report here on benefits of CPAP treatment in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. A 63-year-old patient of African origin presented to the emergency room with COVID-19 pneumonia. Fever had started 5 days before her admission. On day 4, rapid clinical deterioration associated to a high respiratory rate and increased oxygen requirements was noted. The patient was working in an intensive care unit and refused to be intubated. Oxygen was administered at a rate of 15 litres per minute via a Boussignac valve, which initially restored normal oxygen saturation, but this treatment was poorly tolerated and the patient withdrew it after 2 h. A CPAP set at a pressure of 8 cm of water (Goodknight(R)) was then introduced with better tolerance, allowing the patient to wear it almost continuously for more than 38 h. The patient also benefited from the administration of methypredinsolone 40 mg. Concerning tolerance, a substantial advantage was noted for CPAP machine compared to the Boussignac valve with in addition, a clear decrease in respiratory rate. We would like to encourage the use of CPAP, better tolerated for extended hours with lower oxygen flows, in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, where acute respiratory distress all too often leads to patient intubation and the genesis of deleterious lung lesions.","answer":"[\\"Case Report\\"]"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2016 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

Compared to the control of flowering before and after winter by the vernalization and day length pathways, mechanisms that delay or promote flowering during a transient cool or warm period, especially during spring, are less well understood. Due to global warming, understanding this ambient temperature pathway has gained increasing importance. In Arabidopsis thaliana, FLOWERING LOCUS M( FLM) is a critical flowering regulator of the ambient temperature pathway. FLM is alternatively spliced in a temperature-dependent manner and the two predominant splice variants, FLM-ß and FLM-δ, can repress and activate flowering in the genetic background of the A. thaliana reference accession Columbia-0. The relevance of this regulatory mechanism for the environmental adaptation across the entire range of the species is, however, unknown. Here, we identify insertion polymorphisms in the first intron of FLM as causative for accelerated flowering in many natural A. thaliana accessions, especially in cool( 15°C) temperatures. We present evidence for a potential adaptive role of this structural variation and link it specifically to changes in the abundance of FLM-ß. Our results may allow predicting flowering in response to ambient temperatures in the Brassicaceae.Introduction:In plants, fertilization and reproduction are directly linked to the seasonal onset of flowering. Plants enter the reproductive phase when environmental conditions are favorable for seed set and thus reproduction. Since day length and temperature as well as temperature changes throughout the year provide the crucial information about the passage of the seasons and the environment, plants sense these cues for the adjustment of their flowering time[1]. Proper flowering time and reproductive success of a given species or ecotype, on the one side, and the differences in flowering time between species or ecotypes, on the other, are the result of the differential integration of temperature and day length information. The vernalization and the ambient temperature pathways control temperature-dependent flowering in plants. Whereas vernalization requires long periods( weeks) of cold, usually below 10°C, as experienced during the winter[2], the ambient temperature pathway modulates flowering in response to short-term( days) temperature changes in the range between 12°C and 27°C[3–5]. In A. thaliana, the central mechanism of accelerating flowering in response to prolonged cold is achieved by repression of the negative regulator FLOWERING LOCUS C( FLC), a MADS-box transcription factor[6–9]. Different mechanisms than in A. thaliana control vernalization in cereal crops such as wheat and barley, and the activity or inactivity of the vernalization pathway determines the flowering behavior of their winter and spring varieties[10, 11]. To date, the understanding of the vernalization pathway in A. thaliana is already well advanced and it is possible to make predictions on the vernalization requirement based on the plants’ genotypes[12, 13]. In contrast, the complexities of ambient temperature sensing are just beginning to be understood[5, 14, 15]. The finding that loss-of-function mutations of the gene FLM( FLOWERING LOCUS M) reduce the temperature-sensitivity of flowering in A. thaliana accessions suggested that this MADS-box transcription factor acts as a repressor in the ambient temperature pathway[16–18]. The molecular understanding of FLM is complicated by the fact that the FLM gene is alternatively spliced into at least four splice forms[18]. FLM-ß and FLM-δ, which result from the alternative use of the two exons 2( FLM-ß) and 3( FLM-δ), represent the two predominant splice variants in the Columbia-0( Col-0) reference accession[19, 20]. The observation that the abundance of FLM-ß declines from 16°C to 27°C while the abundance of FLM-δ increases over the same temperature range has motivated experiments to examine the effects of the FLM-ß and FLM-δ isoforms in isolation in a flm-3 loss-of-function background. These experiments indicated that the expression of the low temperature-abundant FLM-ß and the warm temperature-abundant FLM-δ can repress and promote flowering, respectively, and consequently a model was established according to which changes in the relative abundance of FLM-ß and FLM-δ control flowering time in response to changes in ambient temperature[19]. FLM directly interacts with several other MADS-box transcription factors to control flowering through the expression of flowering time genes such as FT( FLOWERING LOCUS T) and SOC1( SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO1)[19–21]. SVP( SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE) is an important FLM interaction partner and, in this context, the flowering-repressive activity of FLM-ß and the flowering-promoting activity of FLM-δ have been explained by the differential effects of the FLM-SVP interactions[19]: It was proposed that a DNA-binding heterodimer of FLM-ß with SVP represses flowering by repressing FT and SOC1 expression. Conversely, FLM-δ could sequester SVP into an inactive complex that thereby indirectly promotes FT and SOC1 expression and consequently flowering. Although this experimentally validated model is very intriguing, it is at present not known whether the alternative splicing of FLM plays a role in flowering time adaptation in natural accessions of A. thaliana. There is increasing evidence for global warming due to climate change[8]. Temperature changes by only a few centigrade( °C) can already lead to ecological and physiological constraints that have negative impacts on agricultural production systems[22–24]. Thus, there is a need to better understand the ambient temperature pathway and to integrate this understanding in plant breeding programs[25]. Here, we identify a structural polymorphism in the first intron of FLM as being causative for the early flowering time of the A. thaliana accession Killean-0( Kil-0). This structural polymorphism is present in several additional accessions and directly affects FLM transcript abundance, splicing, and flowering. We further correlate the abundance of the FLM-ß and FLM-δ splice variants with flowering behavior in several A. thaliana accessions and reveal an important role of intron 1 for FLM gene expression and a predominant role of FLM in flowering time control.Discussion:We have identified a recently evolved FLM allele from the accession Kil-0. The insertion of a LINE element in intron 1 of FLMKil-0 resulted in reduced FLM transcript abundance and correlated with an overall acceleration of flowering time that was particularly prominent at 15°C( Fig 7). We identified additional nine FLMLINE accessions that mainly represented lines collected from Germany. Although these FLMLINE accessions were highly homologous over the FLM locus, they represented accessions from genetically different clades indicating that FLMLINE was involved in recent adaptation to early flowering and that its rather narrow geographical distribution is likely due to the young demographic history of this allele. The LINE element insertion of FLMLINE shares 68% homology with LINE class I retrotransposons from A. thaliana. Transposable elements are typically suppressed by epigenetic mechanisms and this suppression can also negatively interfere with the expression of neighboring genes[45–48]. Epigenetic regulation is also known to control the expression of MADS-box transcription factor genes. For example, the chromatin of FLC is modified during vernalization by lysine 27 methylation of histone 3( H3K27me), a repressive mark, and several natural variants interfere with regulatory regions in the FLC intron 1[41, 49–53]. Thus, the LINE insertion could interfere with the direct transcriptional regulation but, alternatively, also with the epigenetic control of the FLMKil-0 locus. However, previous genome-wide studies failed to identify epigenetic marks such as H3K27me on intron 1 of FLM[54] and we detected no differences in transcription rate between the insertion lines and the Col-0 reference. Furthermore, transposon and T-DNA insertions were reported to mediate alternative polyadenylation through the utilization of alternative polyadenylation sites[28–30]. Although we detected a higher abundance of short aberrant polyadenylated transcripts in the insertion lines, we consider it unlikely that the insertion itself provides cis elements that result in their synthesis. Aberrrant transcripts did not extend into the insertion and no differences in quantity and composition of these transcripts were detected between Kil-0 and the Salk line, which have molecularly distinct insertions. We concluded that the reduction of FLM full-length transcript abundance in Kil-0 is caused by a combination of partial premature termination of transcription and aberrant splicing due to the enlargement of the first intron. Conversely, through experiments with FLM transgenes where intronic sequences were deleted, we could conclude that intron 1 was strictly required for FLM expression and activity. A contribution of intronic sequences in gene expression regulation, generally referred to as IME( intron-mediated enhancement), was previously reported for many genes, and in plants specifically for members of the MADS-box transcription factor family[55, 56]. Several studies have already identified corresponding intronic cis-regulatory elements, e. g. in intronic regions of the floral homeotic genes AG( AGAMOUS) and members of the AGL6( AGAMOUS-LIKE6)-subfamily[38–40, 57]. Several independent structural intron polymorphisms were also reported for the MADS-box factor and flowering time regulator VRN1( VERNALIZATION1) from wheat and barley. There, these structural differences in intron 1 composition can promote high VRN1 expression and these differences are the main molecular cause for vernalization-independent flowering in many spring barley and wheat cultivars[10]. Thus structural intron polymorphisms, e. g. through transposon insertions, are a recurrent theme in the expression control of MADS-box transcription factors and the adaptation to the environment through these factors. Interestingly, our expression analysis showed that the expression of the two FLM isoforms, FLM-ß and FLM-δ were differentially affected by the intron 1 insertions. Since this behavior was found in several accessions and was recapitulated by inserting a LINE-bearing FLM transgene in the Col-0 FLM allele, we judge that this regulation again is not related to the nature of the insertion in FLM but rather to the position of the insertion or the corresponding increase in intron length. It remains to be investigated, however, what the underlying molecular basis of the differential effect of the insertions on FLM-ß and FLM-δ abundance is. Through investigations of insertion lines from different sources and ecotypes, we found that the position of the inserted sequence affected the relative abundance of FLM-ß and FLM-δ. In combination, the availability of these lines allowed the examination of flowering time and its correlation with the abundance of the two FLM splice variants. Importantly, our study did not support a role for FLM-δ in flowering time control but rather suggests that FLM-ß abundance alone is the predominant determinant of flowering time in natural variants under the ecologically relevant temperature of 15°C. Thus, previous experiments exploring the contribution of FLM-ß and FLM-δ to flowering time control using transgenic approaches may have overestimated the contribution of FLM-δ, at least in the diverse genetic material and at the temperatures used in our study. At the same time, it cannot be ruled out that FLM-δ levels reached a subcritical level in the insertion lines analyzed in our study so that the contribution of FLM-δ could not be accurately determined. Along these lines, a recent study showed no contribution of the FLM locus to flowering time regulation in a large set of wild A. thaliana ectoypes in warm( 27°C) temperature where FLM-δ is upregulated[58] indicating that even under temperature conditions that promote FLM-δ abundance no important regulatory role could be ascribed to it. Once a detailed understanding of factors controlling FLM gene expression and splicing will be obtained, it will be important to reexamine this aspect in more detail. The role of FLM in flowering time variation was previously established in the temperature-insensitive accessions Nd-1 and Ei-6 where FLM is deleted[16, 17]. In our study, we report the first gene expression variation-allele for FLM and describe a molecular mechanism for the control of flowering time in ambient temperature through structural changes in FLM intron 1. It is interesting to note that loss-of-function alleles of flowering time genes are generally very rare and are typically distributed within a small geographic region. This may indicate that adaptation through gene loss may be disadvantageous outside of the specific ecological niche simply because the loss of the gene will prevent its future reactivation[59, 60]. In the case of FLM, this is exemplified by the Nd-1 and Ei-6 accessions, but also among the many known FLC alleles, only a few null alleles have been reported whereas gene expression-modulatory FLC alleles are more common[6, 12, 49, 50, 61]. In this regard, we perceive at least a trend towards a similar distribution among the A. thaliana FLM alleles. A deeper analysis about the FLM coding sequence polymorphisms will be required to make conclusive statements about the importance of strong and weak FLM alleles during adaptation of flowering time. We conclude that structural variations of FLM intron 1 as described here represent an adaptive mechanism for the control of flowering time in A. thaliana and possibly also in other closely related Brassicaceae. FLM might have a very specific role in flowering time regulation because modulations of its expression seemingly affect only flowering and not other plant growth traits. We, therefore, think that FLM is an excellent candidate gene to precisely and steadily modulate flowering time in a dynamic manner over a broad range of temperature conditions to overcome the impacts of climate change on flowering in plants.","answer":"Plants control their flowering time in response to the temperatures of their environment , e . g . in response to the experience of winter or in response to cold and warm ambient temperatures experienced during spring .

Modify this code to increase its robustness.","answer":"Here\'s a modified version of your code which handles non-numeric inputs and empty lists:```pythondef check_distinct_elements(lst):    # Handle empty list    if not lst:         raise ValueError(\\"List is empty\\")    try:        # Try converting each element to a number        numeric_lst = [float(i) for i in lst]        distinct_elements = set(numeric_lst)        if len(distinct_elements) == 1:            return True        else:            return False    except ValueError:        # Raise an exception if an element is not a number        raise ValueError(\\"List contains non-numeric value(s)\\")```This code works by first checking if the list is empty. If it is, it raises a `ValueError`. Then, it tries to convert each item in the list to a float. If all items can be converted, it proceeds and checks if there is only one distinct number in the list. If any item cannot be converted to a float, it raises a `ValueError`.Note that this code can handle integer and floating point numbers as it converts all numbers to float before comparing them."},{"question":"I need to take a web page and extract the address information from the page. Some are easier than others. I\'m looking for a firefox plugin, windows app, or VB.NET code that will help me get this done.Ideally I would like to have a web page on our admin (ASP.NET/VB.NET) where you enter a URL and it scraps the page and returns a Dataset that I can put in a Grid.","answer":"Data extraction from webpages is often known as \\"web scraping\\". There are various tools and libraries available to perform this task. As per your requirement of Windows app or VB.NET code, you might want to use \\"HtmlAgilityPack\\". It is a powerful HTML parser for .NET and can be used to scrape or parse HTML.Here is a simple example of how you could scrape address information from a web page using HtmlAgilityPack library in VB.NET:```vbImports System.NetImports HtmlAgilityPackPublic Function GetAddressFromWebPage(ByVal url As String) As String    Dim web As New HtmlWeb()    Dim doc As HtmlDocument = web.Load(url)    \' Use XPath to select HTML elements.    \' It depends on the structure of the webpage, you may need to update accordingly.

Depending on the structure of the webpage you are scraping, you may need to adjust the XPath expression, or process the nodes differently.Remember, automated extraction of data from websites, particularly for commercial purposes, may be in breach of the terms of service of those websites. It’s also possibly illegal and unethical, depending on jurisdiction and the purpose of the data extraction.

Create a list, `lexicon`, which would store the advanced linguistics vocabulary.2. Create a list, `group_alphabets`, which would store the provided group of alphabetic symbols from the Latin script.3. Define a function, `find_most_extended_term()`. In this function, sort the lexicon in reverse by string length. This ensures that longer strings are checked first.4. Then, for each word in the lexicon, check if all characters in that word are within the group_alphabets. This can be done by iterating over the string and ensuring each character is in the provided alphabet set.5. As the words are being processed in descending order of length, once a word is found it is the longest one that can be synthesized so it is immediately returned.6. If no word can be synthesized, the function should return `None`.Here is a Python code that implements the above approach.```pythondef find_most_extended_term(lexicon, group_alphabets):    lexicon.sort(key=len, reverse=True)    group_alphabets = set(group_alphabets)    for word in lexicon:        if set(word).issubset(group_alphabets):            return word    return None```This function starts checking from the longest word and checks if the word characters are all in the given set of characters.  By checking longest words first, the function stops and returns the first match it finds, which due to the sorting of lexicon, ensures it\'s the longest word that can be synthesized from the given alphabet set."},{"question":"Write a code to convert all the letters of a given string to lowercase without using any built-in lower() or similar case changing functions.

Right now they\'re just doing things like setting a `this.Birthday` property once they get an answer (which is of type `DateTime?`, with the null indicating a \\"Cancel\\"). Then the caller inspects the `Birthday` property of the dialog it created to figure out what the user answered.My question is,  I know we can set `this.DialogResult` for basic OK/Cancel stuff, but is there a more general way in Windows Forms for a form to indicate \\"here\'s the data I collected\\"?","answer":"Yes! You have several common options to achieve this:1. Public Property:    As you currently are doing, you can expose a public property on the dialog that the caller can check after the dialog is closed.    ```    public class MyDialog : Form    {        public DateTime? Birthday { get; private set; }        private void OnOK()        {            // Validate and set the Birthday property            this.Birthday = ...            this.DialogResult = DialogResult.OK;        }    }    // Usage:    using (var dialog = new MyDialog())    {        if (dialog.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK)        {            var birthday = dialog.Birthday;            // Use birthday...        }    }    ```2. Out Parameter:    Another option would be to use a method with an `out` parameter to return the collected data. You would have to wrap `ShowDialog()` method to implement this.    ```    public DialogResult ShowDialog(out DateTime? birthday)    {        DialogResult result = this.ShowDialog();        birthday = this.Birthday;        return result;    }    ```       In this case, your caller would look something like this:    ```    MyDialog dialog = new MyDialog();    DateTime? birthday;    if (dialog.ShowDialog(out birthday) == DialogResult.OK)    {        // Use birthday...    }    ```3. Register an event:    Create an event that returns the data when the dialog is closed. The event can return a custom `EventArgs` containing the data. This is useful when you need to return multiple pieces of data, or when methods needs to be executed upon the dialog closing.    ```    public event Action<object, BirthdayEventArgs> BirthdaySelected;    private void OnOK()    {        // Raise the event with the selected date.        if (BirthdaySelected != null)        {            BirthdaySelected(this, new BirthdayEventArgs(/*Birthday date here*/));        }        this.DialogResult = DialogResult.OK;    }    // Usage:    MyDialog dialog = new MyDialog();    dialog.BirthdaySelected += (s, e) =>    {        // Use e.Birthday...    };    dialog.ShowDialog();    ```Remember, the correct approach will depend on your use case and which one you feel more comfortable with!"},{"question":"Edit the provided code so that it prints a 10x10 grid of stars, where each star is followed by a space, and each row has alternating colours (red and blue) for the stars.

Please write a few sentences synthesizing the findings of these reports, which could serve as a conclusion section for a systematic review article. Your response should not include any other text. The RCT reports are below.Title 1:An evaluation of patients with severe intermittent claudication and the effect of treatment with naftidrofuryl.Abstract 1:A randomized placebo-controlled study was undertaken in 188 patients with severe intermittent claudication attending two vascular clinics in Manchester and Liverpool. After a 4-week run-in period, patients received active or placebo treatment for 24 weeks. Patients were assessed on a treadmill prior to the 4-week run-in period, at randomization, and at 8, 16, and 24 weeks. Outcome was measured in terms of change in pain-free walking distance, maximum walking distance, and pressure indices. In this severe claudication population, in which the patients presented with a mean pain-free walking distance of 60 m, an intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated that the outcome in the naftidrofuryl-treated group was significantly better than in the group receiving placebo (p = 0.045). Additionally, 7% of patients in the naftidrofuryl group deteriorated compared with 22% in the placebo group (p = 0.005). Of the various risk factors that were recorded during the study--smoking habits, the presence of hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and duration of illness--only duration of illness had a significant influence on outcome. Maximum walking distances alone were not significantly influenced by treatment, but the use of a combined index of pain-free walking distance, maximum walking distance, and pressure indices to record success or failure confirmed a significant treatment effect (p = 0.047). A higher incidence of minor gastrointestinal symptoms was recorded in the naftidrofuryl-treated group. Treatment with naftidrofuryl was shown to prevent or slow the deterioration observed in a group of patients with severe claudication over a 24-week period.Title 2:Treatment of stage II chronic arterial disease of the lower limbs with the serotonergic antagonist naftidrofuryl: results after 6 months of a controlled, multicenter study.Abstract 2:A study was carried out in patients with intermittent claudication (Fontaine\'s stage II). The atheromatous origin of the disease was confirmed and localized by angiography or Doppler. One hundred eight-three patients were selected initially (day -30) with a pain-free walking distance on a treadmill (at a speed of 3 km/h and a slope of 10%) ranging from 150 to 300 m. During the first month (washout period) all patients received two placebo tablets daily. At the end of this run-in period (day -30; day 0) and after checking walking distance stability (allowed variation: 20% between the two measurements), patients were included in the study. According to this criterion, 112 patients were selected and 94 remained during the whole study. The study was designed in double-blind, using two parallel, randomly selected groups. Fifty-two patients received naftidrofuryl (2 x 316.5 mg tablets daily with meals) for 6 months; 42 patients received placebo under the same conditions. During this period, clinical and paraclinical examinations were carried out every quarter (day 90 and day 180). After checking the initial homogeneity of the naftidrofuryl and placebo groups, the comparison between the two groups indicates a significant improvement in the naftidrofuryl group after 3 months and 6 months of treatment, for the pain-free walking distance. For the maximal walking distance, a significant improvement was found at day 180. Nonparametric analysis (chi 2 test) also indicated a significant improvement for the naftidrofuryl group. These results confirm that naftidrofuryl is beneficial in the treatment of patients with chronic arterial disease.Title 3:Naftidrofuryl in chronic arterial disease. Results of a six month controlled multicenter study using Naftidrofuryl tablets 200 mg.Abstract 3:The study was carried out on patients with intermittent claudication (Fontaine\'s stage II). The arterial and atheromatous origin of the disease was confirmed and localized by angiography or Doppler velocimetry examination. One hundred eighty-six patients were selected initially. Their pain-free walking distance on a treadmill (at a speed of 3 km/hour and an inclination of 10%) had to be 150-300 m. During the first month all patients received 3 placebo tablets daily. At the end of this run-in period (D-30; D 0) and after checking walking distance stability (allowed variation: +/- 20% between the two measurements) the patients were included in the study. One hundred fifty-four patients were selected and 118 remained during the whole study. The study was designed as a double-blind, using two parallel randomly selected groups. Sixty-four patients received for six months Naftidrofuryl (3 X 200 mg tablets daily with meals); 54 patients received placebo under the same conditions. During this period, clinical and paraclinical examinations were carried out every quarter (D 90 and D 180). After checking the initial homogeneity of the Naftidrofuryl and placebo-groups, the comparison between groups indicates a significant improvement in Naftidrofuryl group after 3 and 6 months of treatment. At the end of the study the observed differences in walking distance with Naftidrofuryl are approximately twice the difference in the reference group (D 90: p less than 0.05; D 180: p less than 0.02). The results of this study indicate that Naftidrofuryl is an efficient pharmacological tool for treatment of patients with chronic arterial disease (Fontaine\'s stage II).Title 4:[Effect of naftidrofuryl on physiological walking distance in patients with intermittent claudication].Abstract 4:To evaluate the physiological walking distance measured with the Peripheral Arterial Disease Holter Control device (PADHOC) after 12 months of treatment with naftidrofuryl in a double blind placebo controlled, parallel group study, in patients presenting with intermittent claudication.                The outpatients selected were of both sexes, aged 40 to 80, with a chronic, stable intermittent claudication and an ankle brachial index between 0.60 and 0.90. They received naftidrofuryl 200 mg tid or placebo for 12 months. Outcome measures included physiological painfree and maximal walking distances using the PADHOC device. The principle of this device is the measurement of the intermalleolar distances using ultrasound telemetry. The PADHOC measures the walking distance and the speed profile in an ambulatory subject.                182 patients were randomised and 168 entered the intention to treat analysis. The two groups were well matched for demographic variables, risk factors and history of vascular disease. After 12-month treatment, patients who received naftidrofuryl had a 107% improvement of geometric physiological pain-free walking distance versus 12% in the placebo group (P < 0.001) and 74% improvement of geometric maximal physiological walking distance versus 1% in the placebo group (P < 0.001).                This study demonstrates the efficacy of naftidrofuryl versus placebo in patients with intermittent claudication using a new device measuring the walking distances of the patients in a more physiological way than the treadmill test.Title 5:[Naftidrofuryl in arterial occlusive disease. Controlled multicenter double-blind study with oral administration].Abstract 5:The efficacy of naftidrofuryl ( Dusodril ) for treatment of stage II arterial occlusive disease was evaluated in a controlled multi-centre study in a total of 104 out-patients with angiographically documented localization of occlusion. The therapeutic effect was assessed over three months by measurements of walking distance using standardized treadmill conditions. Further parameters were venoocclusive plethysmography and Doppler ultrasonography measurement of pressures. The complaint-free walking distance increased significantly during daily application of 600 mg naftidrofuryl orally (n = 54) during the 12-week assessment period when compared to the placebo group (n = 50). Taking the intraindividual variability of 17.2 m in assessment of walking distance into account, the increase of painless walking of 93 m after treatment for 12 weeks in the active-drug group is considered the result of treatment-induced increased performance.","answer":"Oral naftidrofuryl has a statistically significant and clinically meaningful, although moderate, effect of improving walking distance in the six months after initiation of therapy for people with intermittent claudication. Access by researchers to data from RCTs that are suitable for IPD analysis should be possible through repositories of data from pharmacological trials. Regular formal appraisal of the balance of risk and benefit is needed for older pharmaceutical products."},{"question":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bozo sort&lt;/strong&gt;, a sorting algorithm distinct from the marginally less efficient &lt;strong&gt;bogo sort&lt;/strong&gt;, operates by assessing if the input sequence is sorted and, if not, randomly swapping two elements. This process is iteratively repeated until the sequence is eventually sorted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we take into account all permutations of the first 4 natural numbers as input, the expected value of the number of swaps, averaged over all 4! input sequences, is 24.75. The sequence that is already sorted requires 0 steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this problem, we are examining a variant of bozo sort. If the sequence is not in order, we randomly select three elements and shuffle these three elements randomly. All 3!=6 permutations of these three elements have an equal likelihood of occurrence. The sequence that is already sorted will require 0 steps. If we consider all permutations of the first 4 natural numbers as input, the expected value of the number of shuffles, averaged over all 4! input sequences, is 27.5. Now, consider as input sequences the permutations of the first 11 natural numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the expected number of shuffles this sorting algorithm will perform, averaged over all 11! input sequences? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest integer.&lt;/p&gt;","answer":"This problem can be approached as a Markov process with 11! states, where each one corresponds to one of the possible permutations of the initial sequence. Transition between states is allowed depending on the result of each shuffle. The first step is to compute the transition matrix for the process. Due to the symmetry of the problem, instead of considering all possible permutations of the first 11 natural numbers, we can consider permutations of the first three natural numbers and generalize the result to 11 numbers. Then, for each permutation, we calculate the probability of moving to another permutation after a shuffle. We define the expected number of shuffles as the average over all 11! possible permutations, and compute the mean first passage time from any state to the state corresponding to the sorted sequence, which is a standard result for Markov chains.Given the complexity of the procedure, it is infeasible to do this manually. Instead, we use a simulation approach, known as Monte Carlo simulation. The code given below runs multiple simulations of the sorting algorithm and averages the number of shuffles required to sort each initial sequence. Given the randomness in this process, the more simulations we run, the closer we\'ll get to the true expected value. However, due to the high number of permutations for 11 numbers (11! = 39916800), we sample a subset of all permutations and approximate the expected number of shuffles based on this sample. This approach should give a reasonably accurate estimate of the true expected value.Note: It should be noted that due to the randomness involved in both the sorting algorithm and the Monte Carlo simulation method, the exact answer may vary slightly with each run of the code.Here is the python code for this:```pythonimport randomimport itertoolsdef count_swaps(n):    sequence = list(range(1, n + 1))    swap_count = 0    while sequence != list(range(1, n + 1)):        a, b, c = random.sample(range(n), 3)        sequence[a], sequence[b], sequence[c] =         sequence[b], sequence[c], sequence[a]        swap_count += 1            return swap_countN = 11NUM_TRIALS = 10000total_swaps = 0for _ in range(NUM_TRIALS):    total_swaps += count_swaps(N)print(round(total_swaps / NUM_TRIALS))```This code will produce an output which is close to the expected value. The final result will be the expected number of shuffles, rounded to the nearest integer, which will complete the answer to the given problem."},{"question":"When running my application I sometimes get an error about `too many files open`.Running `ulimit -a` reports that the limit is 1024.  How do I increase the limit above 1024?  `ulimit -n 2048` results in a permission error.","answer":"This issue is caused by restrictions on per-user resource limits on the Linux system. You can usually change the limit for open files in a specific session, but for a permanent change, you can consider the following steps:1. Change the limit in /etc/security/limits.conf file.

Now you need to make sure that the changes in \\"limits.conf\\" will be read and applied at login. This is handled by the pam_limits.so module. It should be referenced from \\"/etc/pam.d/login\\".

Use clear examples for explanation.def sum_primes(n):    \\"\\"\\"Implement a function that takes a positive integer and returns the sum of all prime numbers less than n.    For instance:    sum_primes(5) => 5    sum_primes(11) => 17    sum_primes(0) => 0    sum_primes(20) => 77    sum_primes(1) => 0    sum_primes(18) => 58    \\"\\"\\"","answer":"First let\'s write a helper function, is_prime, which tests whether a given number is a prime number or not. In number theory, a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not the product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. After that we look for all prime numbers less than \'n\' by calling is_prime function.Here is a Python code that solves the problem:```pythondef is_prime(num):    if num < 2:  # numbers less than 2 are not prime numbers        return False    for i in range(2, num):  # check divisibility from 2 to num - 1        if num % i == 0:  # if it\'s divisible, it\'s not a prime            return False    return True  # else, it\'s a primedef sum_primes(n):    prime_sum = 0    for i in range(n):        if is_prime(i):            prime_sum += i    return prime_sum```Now let\'s test the function with some examples:```pythonprint(sum_primes(5))  # output: 5print(sum_primes(11))  # output: 17print(sum_primes(0))  # output: 0print(sum_primes(20))  # output: 77print(sum_primes(1))  # output: 0print(sum_primes(18))  # output: 58```In the first test:For n = 5, the prime numbers would be 2, 3 and all of them sum up to 5.In the second test:For n = 11, the prime numbers would be 2, 3, 5 and 7 and they all sum up to 17.In other cases, similarly, the sum is calculated by adding all the prime numbers less than n.The helper function is_prime is used inside sum_primes function to check if each number in the range from 0 to n is a prime number or not. If it is, it is added to the running total prime_sum and finally the total sum of all prime numbers less than n is returned.Please note, the code has a time complexity of O(n^2), and there are more efficient ways to check for prime numbers. It\'s also worth mentioning that 1 is not a prime number, so we do not need to consider that."},{"question":"Construct an SQL query to delete all the rows from a table where the value of multiple columns together fulfill a complex condition. Given a reference erroneous code, explain the issue in that code and correct it to achieve the desired output.Following is the erroneous code:```SQLDELETE FROM EmployeesWHERE salary < 50000 AND account_status != \'Active\';```In the corrected code, focus on two column_name values - \'age\' and \'account_status\'. The desired operation is to delete all rows where \'age\' is less than a certain value (18 in this case) and \'account_status\' is NOT \'Active\'. Make sure your reasoning explains why the above code is erroneous for the given task.","answer":"The erroneous code outlined attempts to delete all rows from the \\"Employees\\" table where the \'salary\' is less than 50000 and \'account_status\' column value is not \'Active\'. The issue we encounter is with the separation of concerns i.e., the columns involved in the operation do not match the ones specified in the problem statement. The problematic query is using \'salary\' instead of \'age\' and a different numeric value for the comparison operation.The corrected SQL query should resemble this:```SQLDELETE FROM EmployeesWHERE age < 18 AND account_status != \'Active\';```This will delete all rows from \\"Employees\\" where the employee\'s \'age\' is less than 18, and the \'account_status\' field\'s value is NOT \'Active\'. Both conditions must be satisfied for the record to be deleted, due to usage of the AND operator.

Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions that can occur especially when your code base includes multiple libraries.Following are the main purposes and functionalities of a namespace in C++:1. Scopes: A namespace is a region of code which can hold its own variables, objects and functions. These items can have the same names as those in other namespaces without causing a name collision.2. Preventing name conflicts: Namespaces are mainly used for avoiding collision among variable names. Without a namespace, a global variable declared in one part of a program could conflict with a similarly named variable in another part of the program. Having different namespaces resolves this issue.3. Code organization: Namespaces are also used to organize code into logical, easy-to-understand blocks. Each namespace can contain a related group of variables, functions and classes.An example of a namespace usage is the \'std\' namespace in C++. The \'std\' namespace includes features of the C++ Standard Library - such as cout, cin and string. When you use these features, you typically specify that they\'re in the \'std\' namespace by using the scope operator \\"::\\" (for example, std::cout) or by declaring \\"using namespace std;\\" at the start of your program (which tells C++ to assume that you\'re using the \'std\' namespace for the rest of your program).```c++#include <iostream>using namespace std;int main(){    cout << \\"Hello, World!\\";    return 0;}```In the above example, \\"cout\\" is a part of \\"std\\" namespace."},{"question":"Embark on a comprehensive journey into the enigmatic realm of quantum cryptography, accentuating its crucial significance in the swiftly progressing domain of cybersecurity.

A similar strategy is used in [54] for learning to directly warp between different views, while here the coordinates for pixel warping are obtained through projective geometry that enables the factorization of depth and camera pose.Question: Did the authors try other interpolation methods besides the bilinear sampling mechanism?","answer":"No for warping only the differentiable bilinear sampling mechanism is used."},{"question":"I have this snippet of OCR text which originates as a python code can you help me fix it?det se7Zero3s(matrlx}:m, m` tirs7RowHasZero` finstCOlNasZ€rO =_ler(ma+rix),_ler(matrix[0]),_no7 4ll(matrix[0}), not_a|1(ma7rix[i][0] for i in ran9e(m))# Use 7he fint now/colvmn as marker, matrik{0)[j] = 0 indicatez that colunn j_shoulo be markedfor i in ranqe[I, m):fOr j in r&rge(1._n]:if na7rix[i][j)_==_O:matr1x[0][j] -_matrik(l](o] - O# 5€t t#e zeroesfon i im r&nge(1, m):tor i in nar9e(1. m):if m&trix[o][j] == 0 or matrix[i][O] == 0:matrix[i][j] =_0# S€e_if_the first n0w/colunn needs 7o b€ set to sero a well1f firstRowNaZero:ma+nik{o]_= {0]*nit_tirst(oiNasZerO:for l in range(m):m4+r!x[i]{0) = 0det cOun7_non_zero{nnatrik):coun+ - 0for i in rang€(len(matrix)):fon j in r@nge(ler(na+r!x[0])):if matrix[l](j) != 0:if ma+nik[i][j} <_O: # (onvert m3g&tiues t0 p0sit1v3smatrik[i][j] *= -1count +=_1return count","answer":"Here is the corrected Python code:```pythondef setZeroes(matrix):    m, n, firstRowHasZero, firstColHasZero = len(matrix), len(matrix[0]), not all(matrix[0]), not all(matrix[i][0] for i in range(m))    # Use the first row/column as marker, matrix[0][j] = 0 indicates that column j should be marked    for i in range(1, m):        for j in range(1, n):            if matrix[i][j] == 0:                matrix[0][j] = matrix[i][0] = 0    # Set the zeroes    for i in range(1, m):        for j in range(1, n):            if matrix[0][j] == 0 or matrix[i][0] == 0:                matrix[i][j] = 0    # See if the first row/column needs to be set to zero as well    if firstRowHasZero:        matrix[0] = [0]*n    if firstColHasZero:        for i in range(m):            matrix[i][0] = 0def count_non_zero(matrix):    count = 0    for i in range(len(matrix)):        for j in range(len(matrix[0])):            if matrix[i][j] != 0:                if matrix[i][j] < 0:  # convert negatives to positives                    matrix[i][j] *= -1                count += 1    return count```This function searches for zeros in the `matrix` and sets the entire row and column to zero if it finds one.

Concurrently, establish a complex service mesh using Istio to facilitate seamless communication among these microservices, ensuring efficient interaction and superior data transfer. Simultaneously, anticipate potential impediments and formulate strategies for load balancing and fault tolerance, necessitating a layered problem-solving approach to guarantee a thorough comprehension and triumphant accomplishment of the task. Additionally, consider the implications of security and scalability in your design, and provide a detailed explanation of your chosen strategies and their expected outcomes.","answer":"Below is an example of a simple Kubernetes deployment manifest file to orchestrate one microservice, which could be expanded to deploy an array of microservices:```yamlapiVersion: apps/v1kind: Deploymentmetadata:  name: my-microservice  labels:    app: my-microservicespec:  replicas: 3  selector:    matchLabels:      app: my-microservice  template:    metadata:      labels:        app: my-microservice    spec:      containers:      - name: my-microservice        image: gcr.io/my-project/my-microservice:v1        ports:        - containerPort: 8080```To create a complex service mesh using Istio, you need to install and setup Istio on your GKE cluster and then configure your microservices to use Istio for communication. This can include defining `VirtualService`, `DestinationRule`, `ServiceEntry`, `Gateway`, etc., which are resources used by Istio to orchestrate service-to-service communication.Istio, due to its smart routing and load balancing features, takes care of challenges such as load balancing, fault tolerance, circuit breaking, retries and timeouts, which are otherwise difficult to manage. The real power of a service mesh comes from the ability to control the traffic flow and monitor it in a fine-grained manner.Regarding security, Istio provides a powerful feature set around security, like automatic mutual TLS encryption and security policies which span across microservices. It also provides features that help scale the system: sidecar proxies do most of the work without influencing the service business logic.Understanding this design\'s expectation is a layered process, too. For instance, when managing traffic flow, first test it in a staging environment, then divert a small percentage of traffic in production, and finally monitor the effect and the system’s reaction to the new settings.All these understandings depend heavily on proper observability and tracing capabilities, which Istio provides out-of-the-box through the addition of Prometheus and Grafana for metrics, Jaeger for distributed tracing, and Kiali for Service Mesh observability.Remember, these are general principles and practices that need to be adapted and supplemented based on specific project requirements."},{"question":"Conjure a table within the MySQL database environment that meticulously archives intricate details pertaining to a company\'s employees.","answer":"To solve this task, first of all, we would need to create a MySQL database, then proceed to defining the employees table with all necessary attributes.Please note: The following solution is running on the assumption that you want to store detailed information about employees like their name, email, contact number, Date of birth, address, position, hire date and salary.Start by setting up MySQL, then execute the following SQL command:```sqlCREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS CompanyDB;USE CompanyDB;CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Employees (   id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,   firstName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,   lastName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,   email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,   phoneNumber VARCHAR(15),   dateOfBirth DATE,   address VARCHAR(255),   position VARCHAR(100),   hireDate DATE,   salary DECIMAL(10, 2),   PRIMARY KEY(id));```This SQL command will create a new database named \\"CompanyDB\\". Then, it creates a new table called \\"Employees\\" under the \\"CompanyDB\\" database, with fields (columns) for id, firstName, lastName, email, phoneNumber, dateOfBirth, address, position, hireDate, and salary. The ID field is set as the primary key, which means it will be unique for each employee and will be used to identify individual records.Remember that real employees table often contains sensitive information like date of birth, salary, etc. Be sure to handle this kind of information with proper security measures, legal compliance, and respect for your employee\'s privacy."},{"question":"There is a PHP file called test2.php,the code is in follow:<?phpdata=array(    \'name\' => \'jack\',    \'age\' => 8,);?>I want to modify the data in anoher php file called test1.php,but i find that if only use:require_once \\"./test2.php\\";data[\'age\']=10;echo data[\'age\'];Although the output is 10,but data in test2.php dosen\'t change.I want to know how to edit a PHP file in anoher PHP file.","answer":"You cannot modify the content of a PHP file from another PHP script like that. In PHP, when you include or require a script, it is essentially injected and executed at that point in your code. It\'s not like referencing a library or a module where you have access to its internal state.What you\'re doing in your example is including the test2.php script which defines data, and then in your main script (test1.php) you are modifying that variable. But the actual contents of test2.php are not being changed - only the data object for the current runtime.If you want to maintain the state across different script runs then you should use a database or some other form of persistent storage like files, sessions etc. Then whenever you modify your data you also update the persistent storage.Here\'s an example using SESSION:// test2.php<?phpsession_start();_SESSION[\'data\']=array(    \'name\' => \'jack\',    \'age\' => 8,);?>// test1.php<?phpsession_start();require_once \\"./test2.php\\";_SESSION[\'data\'][\'age\']=10;echo _SESSION[\'data\'][\'age\']; // Outputs 10You can then access _SESSION[\'data\'] in any other script.Keep in mind that PHP isn\'t meant to dynamically modify its own source code.

This is part of the low-level configuration of IIS (Microsoft\'s web server technology for Windows) which is usually stored in a file called metabase.xml.Problems (like yours) usually arise because ASP.NET Development Server, which comes with Visual Studio, doesn\'t have a Metabase like IIS does. As a result, IIS-related server variables like APPL_MD_PATH don\'t return any value i.e. it will be blank or null.You\'ll need to run your ASP.NET website on a local IIS server if you want to debug it in conditions more representative of your live environment. Depending on the version of Windows you\'re using, you may already have IIS available, otherwise, you\'ll need to install it. Once installed, you can create a new website and point it to your project\'s folder, or create a virtual directory for your project under the default website.Then in Visual Studio, go to the properties of your project.

The best way to handle such situations is by troubleshooting with a systematic approach, logically narrowing down where the problem might be.Let\'s assume you have a situation: You are provided with a piece of code of a Binary Search Algorithm written in Python which is intended to find a given number in a sorted list. But this algorithm doesn\'t work properly. Your task here is not just to create a Binary Search algorithm but to debug an already given one which might consist of logical errors.This erroneous Binary Search Library is supposed to return the index of search_num if it\'s present, otherwise -1. Followed by finding the issue, correct the binary search algorithm. Below is the erroneous piece of code:```pythondef binary_search(data, search_num):    low = 0    high = len(data)    while low <= high:        mid = (low / 2) + (high / 2)        if data[mid] == search_num:            return mid        elif data[mid] < search_num:            low = mid + 1        else:            high = mid - 1    return -1data = [1, 7, 11, 14, 16]search_num = 14print(binary_search(data, search_num))```You\'re given the test data:  data = [1, 7, 11, 14, 16]  search_num = 14","answer":"There is an inherent issue in this code which is due to the mid value calculation. When `low` and `high` are both large, `(low / 2) + (high / 2)` can result in a decimal value. The division operator `/` in python returns a float value.The correct way is to first add `low` and `high` and then do integer division using `//`. There is another issue with the line `high = len(data)`. As the python list starts from the index 0, `high` should be defined as `len(data) - 1`.Here is the corrected Python piece of code:```pythondef binary_search(data, search_num):    low = 0    high = len(data) - 1    while low <= high:        mid = (low + high) // 2        if data[mid] == search_num:            return mid        elif data[mid] < search_num:            low = mid + 1        else:            high = mid - 1    return -1data = [1, 7, 11, 14, 16]search_num = 14print(binary_search(data, search_num)) # prints 3```The fixed algorithm now outputs the correct ordinal position (third index, starting from 0, is indeed 14)."},{"question":"Design a function that receives a string and a natural number as inputs.

Repeat the process until all the string is traversedThis can be implemented like the following:```pythonimport unicodedatadef unicode_word_segments(s, n):    vowels = [\'A\', \'E\', \'I\', \'O\', \'U\', \'a\', \'e\', \'i\', \'o\', \'u\'] # unicode vowels    s = \'\'.join(char for char in s if char.isalpha() or char.isspace()) # remove non-alphabetic characters        chunks = []    chunk = \'\'    count = 0    for char in s:        if unicodedata.normalize(\\"NFKD\\", char).encode(\'ASCII\', \'ignore\').decode() in vowels: # if unicode vowel            count += 1        if count == n: # if count reached n            chunk += char            chunks.append(chunk) # add chunk to chunks            chunk = \'\' # reset chunk            count = 0 # reset count        else: # if count did not reach n            chunk += char    return chunks```Following are the test runs:```pythonprint(unicode_word_segments(\\"Daydreaming about vacations\\", 3))# Output: [\'Day\', \'drea\', \'ming\']print(unicode_word_segments(\\"Healthy cooking every day\\", 2))# Output: [\'Hea\', \'lthy\', \'coo\', \'king\']print(unicode_word_segments(\\"We are alive\\", 1))# Output: [\'We\', \'ar\', \'e\', \'ali\', \'ve\']print(unicode_word_segments(\\"\\", 7))# Output: []print(unicode_word_segments(\\"Hello world\\", 3))# Output: []```"},{"question":"How would you program a cascading \\"Goodbye Galaxy\\" message with alternating colors on a computer console, while also ensuring the message is responsive to terminal window size changes and manages memory efficiently?","answer":"Below is a possible Python solution using the curses library.```pythonimport cursesimport timedef main(stdscr):    # Turn off cursor blinking    curses.curs_set(0)    # Color setup    curses.start_color()    curses.init_pair(1, curses.COLOR_RED, curses.COLOR_BLACK)    curses.init_pair(2, curses.COLOR_GREEN, curses.COLOR_BLACK)    msg = \\"Goodbye Galaxy\\"    while True:        # Clear the screen        stdscr.erase()        # Get the terminal size        term_height, term_width = stdscr.getmaxyx()        x = term_width//2 - len(msg)//2        # Attribution of colors in a var        color = curses.color_pair(1) if int(time.time()) % 2 == 0 else curses.color_pair(2)        # Print msg at center of screen        stdscr.attron(color)        stdscr.addstr(term_height//2, x, msg)        stdscr.attroff(color)        # Refresh the screen        stdscr.refresh()        # Wait before the next iteration        time.sleep(0.5)curses.wrapper(main)```This program creates a mechanism to alternate colors every half-second by using `time.time()`. Here, we use the `getmaxyx()` method which returns a tuple (height, width) of the terminal window. And this version is responsive to terminal window size changes because it doesn\'t just print the message at a static location, but rather calculates the location dynamically based on the current terminal window size. Curses library takes care of the memory management so we don\'t need to manually manage the memory.This method is particularly useful for UNIX-based systems and might not be operable on or needs additional installations for Windows systems. For Windows Visual Studio C++ Build Tools, or the Windows 10 SDK component for C++ x64/x86 build tools needs to be installed for the proper working.

There is a mismatch between the id you have defined in your XML and the id you are trying to access in your Java activity.If you already properly defined the \\"btnrotation\\" in your XML and still got the error, there are a few things you could try:1. Check your imports: Make sure you are not importing `android.R`. Sometimes, Android Studio accidentally imports the android default `R` class, and it leads to these kinds of issues. You should import yourpackage.R instead;2. Clean/Rebuild your project: Go to Build -> Clean Project then Build -> Rebuild Project. Sometimes this can resolve the issue;3. Invalidate your caches/Restart: Go to File -> Invalidate Caches/Restart. Occasionally, Android Studio can have caching issue, which might make the new resources not read correctly;4. Check your XML: See whether there are any errors in any other XML resource files, any errors will cause the R.java not to generate correctly, hence some resource ids might not be accessible;5. Check your ids: Ensure that the button id matches in your XML file and Java file. XML is case sensitive, so btnrotation, BtnRotation and btnRotation are three different things.6. Confirm your layout: Are you using the correct layout file in `setContentView(R.layout.activity_rotation)`? Make sure the `activity_rotation.xml` contains the button with id `btnrotation`.

The realm of quantum teleportation is complex and brimming with theoretical and experimental intricacies, which necessitates lengthy and diversified discourse beyond the capabilities of an AI model. Additionally, providing a comprehensive understanding of all the potential implications of quantum teleportation on the broader landscape of quantum mechanics, computing, and cryptography is an expansive undertaking requiring deep, specialized knowledge, and extensive research, which transcends my functionality.However, I can provide a fundamental understanding of quantum teleportation, its implications on quantum communication, and potential future developments.Quantum teleportation is a process by which quantum information can be transmitted through a classical communication channel, from one location to another, in combination with shared entanglement. It was first proposed by Charles Bennett and a group of researchers at IBM in 1993. The phenomenon does not transport matter itself, but rather the state of a quantum particle to another.The information is sent via qubits, complex units of quantum information, which operate under principles of superposition and entanglement. Superposition allows a quantum object to exist in multiple states simultaneously, while entanglement connects particles together so that the state of one instantly influences the other, no matter the distance. This instantaneous, long-distance effect is one of the essential advantages of quantum communication, promising new horizons in secure and efficient data transmission.However, quantum teleportation currently faces numerous challenges, mainly in the reliable creation and maintenance of entanglement over long distances, quantum memory storage, and the overall uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics.Quantum teleportation can potentially impact quantum computing and cryptography by enabling secure quantum key distribution protocols, and facilitating distant quantum computation processes where quantum data need to be transferred between quantum computers maintaining their superposition states. Furthermore, it may lead to more secure communication networks resistant to eavesdropping.Given these visible implications and the unrelenting efforts in the realm of quantum physics, the future of quantum computing, cryptography, and telecommunications will likely be significantly shaped by further advancements and understanding of quantum teleportation.Given the profound complexity and ever-evolving nature of the field, continuous exploration and research in quantum mechanics and quantum teleportation are imperative in navigating its future implications in quantum computing and cryptography.

It was here the notoriety of quantum entanglement was birthed, originating from Einstein\'s dismissal of the concept as \\"spooky action at a distance\\". Bohr vehemently defended it, affirming its pertinence to the quantum realm.Over time, the mists of prejudice lifted, unveiling quantum entanglement as one of the most profound mysteries in quantum mechanics. The theory postulates that objects, once entangled, remain inherently connected, despite spatial separations. Altering the state of one particle prompts an instantaneous response in its counterpart, irrespective of the infinite distance dividing them.Burgeoning technological advancements have transmogrified these apprehensions into working features, particularly within quantum cryptography. Quantum entanglement, by nature, begets utter security, rendering it a congruent choice for safe transmission of data. The act of observing or interfering with the entangled particles stirs the system, exposing possible eavesdropping. Thus, a fool-proof strategy emerges, leveraging quantum mechanics to protect information from potential hackers.However, it stands pivotal to address inherent limitations - first and foremost, the difficulty in maintaining entanglement. Environmental disturbances, referred to as \\"decoherence,\\" often cause entangled systems to disintegrate rapidly. Addressing this demands robust methods to minimize environmental influences and shield entangled systems.Moreover, quantum entanglement poses extravagant computational challenges. Traditional binary computer languages struggle to effectively compute entanglement states due to their exponential nature, necessitating the development of quantum algorithms and computational languages that can efficiently process quantum data.Delving into the profound implications of quantum entanglement, it stands as quantum mechanics\' cornerstone, expected to revolutionize frameworks ranging from computation to cryptography. Its conspicuous presence within quantum cryptography may aid the rise of entirely secure communication networks, subverting the constant threat of cyber espionage. Moreover, it could pave way towards quantum computers, opening new vistas of computational power and speed.However, embracing the prominence of quantum entanglement within quantum cryptography inevitably calls for acknowledging possible setbacks. Not all concepts transpose seamlessly into practice, particularly within a realm as unpredictable as quantum mechanics.In conclusion, it is within our grasp to mold the future of quantum cryptography leveraging quantum entanglement whilst veering past inherent hurdles. Quantum entanglement has the potential to sustain quantum encryption\'s growing footprint in our swiftly digitizing world, judiciously advancing while remaining vigilant of these hurdles - a potent recipe for the progressive evolution of quantum cryptography."},{"question":"In the intricate task of architecting a resilient microservices infrastructure leveraging Google Cloud\'s Kubernetes and Istio, I\'ve stumbled upon initial hurdles.

Could you also probe further into the significance of each stage, the potential fallout of subpar execution, while also contemplating the interaction among the stages and the effect of the sequence in which they are executed? Moreover, could you critically assess the ramifications of the architectural choices made at each juncture and how they might influence the overall resilience and scalability of the system, including the capacity for future expansion and adaptability to forthcoming technological innovations?","answer":"That\'s quite an extensive range of questions on a highly technical subject, but I\'ll do my best to outline a general guide on how to architect a resilient microservices infrastructure using Kubernetes and Istio. Given the intricate nature of this task, I\'ll need to simplify elements and might not cover every possible issue or advanced tactic. 1. Plan Your Microservices Architecture: This stage includes defining microservices, establishing communication and identifying data schema. The impact of poor execution at this stage could lead to complex, unmanageable services; moreover, not having clear boundaries between services can create code dependencies. 2. Set Up a Kubernetes Cluster: Once the architecture is planned, the next step is setting up your Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. Choosing the right size and type of the cluster is very crucial as subpar execution can significantly affect the performance of the service.3. Deploy Your Microservices to Kubernetes: After configuring the Kubernetes cluster, deploy your planned microservices. Deployments can describe a desired state for your apps using Pods and ReplicaSets. Poor deployment practices can lead to service downtime and potentially data loss.4. Adopt Istio on Your Kubernetes Cluster: Istio offers a uniform way to connect, secure, control, and observe microservices. Poor adoption of Istio can result in security risks, lack of insights into the microservices behavior and network bottlenecks.5. Service Mesh Control and Observability: Usage of Istio’s control features like traffic management, resiliency, policy enforcement and observing the service behavior. If not done properly, it can lead to improper routing of traffic, lack of failover configurations and no control over service communications.6. Secure Your Microservices: Istio provides security features like identity and certificate management, mutual TLS, network policies, and more. Poor security implementations can lead to data breaches and attacks.These stages interlink with each other; changing the sequence of execution might result in unexpected behavior or compatibility issues. Furthermore, every architectural choice at each stage has consequences. For example, choosing monolithic over microservices might affect the scalability of the system. Suboptimal use of Kubernetes and Istio may affect the resilience of the system.Therefore, understanding your system requirements and choosing the appropriate services are key to success. This would also make the system more scalable and adaptable to future technological changes. Regular updates to the infrastructure, following community practices, and adaption to new features in Kubernetes and Istio will also contribute in keeping the system robust and efficient."},{"question":"Can you expound on the lesser-known nomenclature used for adversarial example detection in the field of deep learning?","answer":"Adversarial example detection, in the context of deep learning, is the science of identifying inputs that have been intentionally modified to cause a machine learning model to make a mistake. These maliciously crafted inputs are known as adversarial examples. While some are familiar with the most common nomenclature associated with this area, such as \\"adversarial attacks\\" or \\"adversarial training,\\" there are a few other terms that may not be as familiar to non-experts. 1. Robustness: This is a property that pertains to the ability of a model to resist adversarial examples and provide correct output even in the presence of slight modifications to the input.2. Adversarial Noise or Perturbations: These are the minute changes or manipulations that are added to the original data points or images to mislead the learning models. 3. Perturbation Algorithms: These are methods such as the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) or Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) which create adversarial examples by applying small changes that will most impact the classifier output.4. Defensive Distillation: A training approach which makes it difficult for an attacker to find adversarial examples.5. Adversarial Patches: These are noticeable adversarial perturbations usually in the shape of a small object or patch, designed to cause misclassification when placed in the input scale/space.6. Evasion attacks: Type of attacks where the attacker modifies the feature vector at test time to mislead the classifier.7. Poisoning attacks: In these attacks, the training dataset itself is manipulated with adversarial examples impacting the entire learning phase of the model.8. Transferability: It is the property that allows adversarial examples generated for one model to also affect other models.9. Gradient Obfuscation: A defense strategy where the gradients of a model are made to be incorrect or useless, making it hard for an attacker to generate adversarial examples based on the model’s gradients.10. Certified Defenses: These provide a mathematical guarantee that the model will not be fooled by adversarial input within a certain range. Understanding these lesser-known terms is vital for anyone interested in adversarial example detection and in securing machine learning models against such attacks."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

after it is expected that field decay would continue for much longer time since expansion continues even after the passage of the reverse shock . from hydrodynamic simulations , an expression for the time of the reverse shock passage ( i.e. the return time of the reverse shock to the origin ) has been given @xcite as    @xmath10    where the first term is the density of the ism , the second the ejecta mass during the snr explosion and the third the snr blast wave energy .the stellar wind of a high - mass star can blow a cavity around the progenitor star @xcite with relatively low ism density , so that @xmath11 .in such a case it is expected that @xmath12 can decay as @xmath13 , until the field is low enough for the x - ray flux to drop below the typical sensitivity levels . as a result ,in a scenario where the magnetic field decays as a function of time , the synchrotron emission will also fade as the pwn evolves .the reduced synchrotron losses for high - energy electrons for such a scenario will then lead to increased lifetimes for these leptonic particles . for timescales shorter than the inverse - compton lifetime of the electrons ( @xmath14 years ), this will result in an accumulation of vhe electrons which will also lead to an increased gamma - ray production due to up - scattering of cmb photons .such accumulation of very - high energy electrons in a pwn has indeed been seen in many tev pwne ( such as hess j1825 - 137 @xcite ) .to summarize , during their evolution pwn may appear as gamma - ray sources with only very faint low - energy counterparts and this may represent a viable model for many unidentified tev sources .this effect can be clearly seen in fig .[ fig1 ] , shown by okkie de jager in scineghe 2008 conference @xcite .there are numerous observational hints pointing to the fact that the interstellar magnetic field in the milky way has field strength of the order of several microgauss in the inner galactic disc , and presumably drops to tenths of microgauss at higher latitudes @xcite @xcite .although neglected in previous studies , this magnetic field of the ism into which the pulsar wind nebula is expanding must have some effect onto the morphology and time evolution of the pwn .as the magnetic field in the pwn drops rather rapidly over time , as @xmath15 , it becomes comparable to the surrounding ism field at timescales roughly comparable to the transition timescale into the post - sedov phase .however , as noted above , different pwn will be located in environments where the ambient field strength is different by factors of order unity , depending rather strictly on the location of the pwn in the galaxy .the respective timescales for the field to become comparable to the ism field will therefore differ by a factor of @xmath16 for a pwn at the inner disc compared to one in the galactic halo .detailed studies of the effects on pwn morphology and evolution are highly demanding and yet challenging , owing to the limited resolution of high energy instruments and the relative scarcity of identified pwn .ancient pwne are a natural explanation for tev unidentified sources @xcite . in fact @xmath17% of tevgalactic sources are still formally unidentified @xcite ; almost all ( among them , only hess j0632 + 057 @xcite , that is considered a @xmath4-ray binary candidate , and hess j1943 + 213 @xcite , considered a hbl candidate but recently suggested to be more likely a pwn @xcite , are point - like ) are extended objects with angular sizes ranging from approximately 3 to 18 arc minutes ( but of few more extended exceptions , such as hess j1841 - 055 @xcite ) , lying close to the galactic plane ( suggesting a location within the galaxy ) . in each case, the spectrum of the sources in the tev energy range can be characterized as a power - law with a differential spectral index in the range 2.1 to 2.5 .the general characteristics of these sources ( spectra , size , and position ) are similar to previously identified galactic vhe sources ( e.g. pwne ) , however these sources have so far no clear counterpart in lower - energy wavebands .this scenario is particularly suitable for several sources that , even after deep mwl observations , lack any plausible x - ray counterparts ( such as hess j1507 - 622 @xcite , hess j1427 - 608 , hess j1708 - 410 @xcite and hess j1616 - 508 @xcite @xcite ) . on the other hand , several unidentified sources have already been identified as pwne after their discovery ( such as hess j1857 + 026 @xcite or hessj1303 - 631 @xcite ) and in sources that have several plausible counterparts , the pwne contribution can hardly be avoided ( such as hot spot b in hess j1745 - 303 @xcite or hess j1841 - 055 ) .    fig .[ fig3 ] shows the example of hess j1507 - 622 : this vhe source does not have any snr as a possible counterpart and does not show any coincident or close - by pulsar @xcite ; as said , it is expected that the pulsar already spun - down and that the x - ray nebula faded away below the sensitivity of current x - ray instruments , however it requires an arbitrary choice of the initial conditions in order to model this source : in the shown example we assume to have conditions similar to the g21.5 - 0.9/psr j1833 - 1034 system .another important consequence of these long - living gamma - ray sources regards starburst galaxies : in fact it has been recently shown @xcite that pwne are important and not negligible in explaining the tev emission detected from ngc 253 @xcite and from m82 @xcite .in fact , even if m82 and ngc253 show a much harder gev gamma - ray spectrum than the milky way ( in line with the high gas density in the star forming regions ( sfrs ) and a cosmic - ray origin of the gamma rays ) , diffusive - convective escape of the cosmic rays from the sfrs should lead to a steepening of the cosmic - ray induced gamma - ray spectrum above @xmath18 10 gev , in which case the cosmic rays would fall short in explaining the tev luminosities ; on the other hand pwne associated with core - collapse supernovae in sfrs can readily explain the observed high tev luminosities .the proof of this could arrive from deeper gamma - ray observations on other galaxies , as shown in fig ..    moreover also neutrino observations could reveal if the pwn play a role in accelerating cosmic ray protons and ions ; the highly magnetized pulsar equatorial wind may also give rise to non - negligible acceleration of cosmic rays by this source class .protons and ions , swept into the plerion by the reverse shock , could be accelerated efficiently at the ultrarelativistic pulsar wind shocks @xcite @xcite .this scenario could possibly be tested by searching for high - energy neutrinos from galactic pwns like the crab . until now ,such measurements have turned up only null - results . however , a stacking analysis of candidate sources could significantly enhance the neutrino telescope sensitivity , thus resulting in a much more decisive test of this scenario . moreoverrecently strong upper limits have been given by means of ice cube ( e.g. @xcite ) , limits close to the theoretical predictions .the idea of presenting this on - going job came as a small sign to honor the memory of a great scientist and a wonderful person : okkie de jager .okkie , working with you was a great honor we will miss you very much ! thank you also for encouraging to put forward this research . + bmbf contract 05a08ww1 is also acknowledged .ostriker and gunn , 1969,_apj _ , * 157 * , 1395 .rees and gunn , 1974 , _ mnras _ , * 167 * , 1 .kennel and coroniti , 1984 , _ apj _ , * 283 * , 710 .komissarov and lyubarsky , 2004 , _ mnras _ , * 349 * , 779 .dal zanna , amato and bucciantini , 2004 , _ a&a _ ,* 421 * , 1063 .de jager , 2008 , _ apj _ , * 678 * , l113 .collaboration , 2011 , _a&a _ , * 525 * , id.a45 .de jager et al . , 2009 ,ferreira and de jager , 2008 , _a&a _ , * 478 * , 17 .chevalier and liang , 1989,_apj _ , * 344 * , 332 .aharonian et al . , 2006 , _a&a _ , * 460 * , 365 .de jager , 2008 , scineghe conference .widrow , 2002 , _ rev ._ , * 74 * , 775 .mao et al . , 2010 , _apj _ , * 714 * , 1170 .tam et al . , 2010 , _* 518 * , id.a8 .aharonian et al ._ a&a _ , * 469 * , l1 .collaboration , 2011 , _a&a _ , * 529 * , id.a49 .gabanyi et al . , 2011 , arixiv:1110.5039 aharonian et al . , 2008 , _* 477 * , 353 .aharonian et al . , 2006 , _apj _ , * 636 * , 777 .matsumoto et al . , 2007 , _pasj _ , * 59 * , s199 .aharonian et al . , 2005 , _* 439 * , 1013 .aharonian et al . , 2008 , _a&a _ , * 483 * , 509 .green et al . , 1999 , _apjs _ , * 122 * , 207 .abdo et al . , 2011 ,mannheim , elssser and tibolla , 2010 , arxiv:1010.2185 .collaboration , 2009 , _ science _ , * 326 * , 1080 .acciari et al . , 2009 , _nature _ , * 462 * , 770 .atoyan and aharonian , 1996 , _ mnras _ , * 278 * , 525 .bednarek and bartosik , 2005 , _ journal of phys .g nucl and part .phys _ , * 31 * , 1465 .dreyer et al . , 2011 , _ astr ._ , * 7 * , 7 .","answer":"in a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) , the lifetime of inverse compton emitting electrons exceeds the lifetime of its progenitor pulsar , but it exceeds also the age of the electrons that emit via synchrotron radiation ;

Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the interaction between innate and adaptive immune responses to IBV infection is a crucial element for further improvements in strategies to control IB. To this end, two chicken lines, selected for high (L10H line) and low (L10L line) serum concentration of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) were studied. In total, 32 birds from each line were used. Sixteen birds from each line were infected with IBV and sixteen were left uninfected. Eight uninfected and infected birds from each line were euthanized at 1 and 3 weeks post infection. RNA sequencing was performed on   samples from all 64 birds and differential gene expression analysis was performed for four comparisons: L10L line versus L10H line for uninfected birds at weeks 1 and 3, respectively, and in the same way for infected birds. Functional analysis was performed using Gene Ontology (GO) Immune System Process terms specific for Gallus gallus. RESULTS: Comparing uninfected L10H and L10L birds, we identified 1698 and 1424 differentially expressed (DE) genes at weeks 1 and 3, respectively. For the IBV-infected birds, 1934 and 866 DE genes were identified between the two lines at weeks 1 and 3, respectively. The two most enriched GO terms emerging from the comparison of uninfected birds between the two lines were “Lymphocyte activation involved in immune response” and “Somatic recombination of immunoglobulin genes involved in immune response” at weeks 1 and 3, respectively. When comparing IBV-infected birds between the two lines, the most enriched GO terms were “Alpha-beta T cell activation” and “Positive regulation of leukocyte activation” at weeks 1 and 3, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy birds from the two lines showed significant differences in expression profiles for subsets of adaptive and innate immunity-related genes, whereas comparison of the IBV-infected birds from the two lines showed differences in expression of immunity-related genes involved in T cell activation and proliferation. The observed transcriptome differences between the two lines indicate that selection for MBL had influenced innate as well as adaptive immunity.

Keywords: IBV, Coronavirus, Infectious bronchitis, Chicken, RNA sequencing, Transcriptome, Spleen, Mannose-binding lectin, Immune response Background Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute and highly contagious disease of the upper-respiratory tract caused by the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The virus is a member of the Coronaviridae family and has numerous serotypes and strains. Rapid replication combined with high mutation rate and recombination are the main causes of the observed high diversity [1] . The respiratory tract is the primary target organ and entry point for the virus, before further spread to kidneys and gonads. The most common symptoms of IB are related to the respiratory tract and include gasping, coughing, sneezing, tracheal rales, and nasal discharge [2] . Feed conversion and average daily gain are affected in broilers, and infection is often followed by secondary bacterial infections. In layers, IBV causes a reduction in egg production and egg quality. Today, IB is one of the most economically important diseases in the poultry industry [2] . Infection outbreaks are controlled by a combination of strict management practices and vaccination. The strict management practices, which include the maintenance of the housing temperature and ventilation, are essential, because IBV is highly contagious and spreads very fast. Live attenuated and inactivated vaccines are widely used for control and prevention of IBV infection [3, 4] . As there is little or no cross-protection between different serotypes/variants of the virus, hence vaccines should contain serotypes present in a particular area in order to induce adequate protection [1] . New multi-strain vaccines with the optimal antigen combination and optimal adjuvants are therefore required for future IBV control. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the interaction between innate and adaptive immune responses to IBV infection is a crucial element for further improvements of the vaccines. IBV infection induces a wide range of immune responses in chickens. An innate immune response is activated during the initial stages of infection in the mucosal lining of the trachea following binding of IBV virions to receptors on epithelial cells [5] . Activation of this innate immune response may be initiated by Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling upon IBV recognition [6, 7] . In addition, rapid activation of natural killer (NK) cells has been observed one day after IBV infection [8] as well as increased macrophage numbers in lungs and trachea after primary IBV infection [9] . In the case of the adaptive immune responses, T lymphocyte subpopulations are actively involved in the early stages of IBV clearance [7, 10] exhibiting rapid activation upon IBV infection [6] . Furthermore, studies have shown that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) play an important role in responding to primary infections with IBV [10, 11] . In addition to T cell responses, IBV specific antibodies, of all three antibody classes present in chickens, have been reported [12] [13] [14] . A specific local antibody response in avian infectious bronchitis is characteristic for the response to a secondary infection [15] . The innate and adaptive immune systems are strongly interconnected, which is also seen in the response to IBV infection, and the connection possibly involves the serum collectin, mannose-binding lectin (MBL) as a key player [16] . Two chicken lines which were selected for high and low MBL serum concentrations (designated L10H and L10L, respectively), were used in the present study. Selective breeding has been performed for 14 generations using the combination of two strains (67.5 % UM-B19 chickens and 33.5 % White Cornish) as a starting population, as described by Juul-Madsen et al. [17] . The final result was two divergent lines, with mean MBL serum concentrations of 33.4 μg/ml for the L10H line and 7.6 μg/ml for the L10L line, respectively [18, 19] . The mean MBL serum concentration for 14 different chicken lines representing both broilers and layers is around 6 μg/ml, but varies from 0.4 to 37.8 μg/ml in normal healthy chickens with protein produced in the liver as the main source of circulating MBL [17] . In chickens, a positive correlation between MBL serum concentrations and the severity of several infections, such as infections caused by IBV [19] , Escherichia coli [20] and Pasteurella multocida [21] , has been observed. Chicken MBL binds to IBV [16, 22] , therefore it is possible that MBL facilitates innate responses such as opsono-phagocytosis, complement activation or virus neutralization, in the early stages of IBV infection. In mammals MBL has also been shown to influence induction of adaptive immunity [23] . In support of the role of MBL in response to IBV, Kjaerup et al. [18] observed considerable differences in cellular adaptive immune parameters in response to an IBV infection between lines L10L and L10H. Furthermore, birds from L10H line exhibited lower viral loads and less severe damage of tracheal cilia following the IBV infection in comparison to birds from the L10L line. The aim of this study was to characterize the   transcriptome of healthy birds from the two lines selected for serum MBL, and to investigate differences in molecular mechanisms behind the development of systemic adaptive immunity between the L10L and L10H lines infected with IBV. The experimental timeline and sampling time points are as illustrated in Fig. 1 and a full description of the experimental infection is reported by Kjaerup et al. [18] . The birds were infected at 3 weeks of age and from day 2 post-infection (p.i. ), showed clinical signs characteristic of IBV infection, including sneezing and labored breathing. Viral loads in tracheal swabs were assessed for all birds as reported in the previous paper published on the experimental infection study [18] . No virus was detected in the uninfected birds at any time point throughout the experiment. Viral genomes were detected in swabs from infected birds from day 1 to 8 p.i. Notably, significantly lower viral loads (p < 0.03) were observed in birds from line L10H in comparison to infected birds from line L10L [18] . Detection and quantification of splenic gene expression RNA sequencing data were produced from eight infected and eight uninfected birds from each of the two lines at two sampling occasions, as described in the materials and methods section. All samples passed quality control measures for raw and trimmed sequenced reads except for individual no. 46, which was removed due to a very low number of sequenced reads. For the remaining birds, an average of over 37 million reads were obtained per sample for the 63 samples analyzed, with 81 % of the reads mapping to the chicken genome reference sequence, as described in the materials and methods section (See summary statistics with the number of mapped and total reads is presented in Additional file 1: Table S1 ). In total, 17,113 expressed genes were identified. After filtering genes with fewer than one read per million in eight samples [24] (genes which would not achieve statistical significance for differential expression), the final list contained 11,292 expressed genes. Before performing the differential gene expression analysis, further multivariate analysis was carried out on the raw and normalized gene count data to identify any discrepancies. Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plot on expressed genes between the two lines, L10H and L10L, showed that they differ considerably in their transcriptome profiles for both uninfected and IBV-infected birds [See Additional file 2: Figure S1 ]. Moreover, inter-individual variation in gene expression at week 1 was considerably higher than that observed at week 3 for both uninfected and IBV-infected birds [See Additional file 2: Figure S1 ]. Birds 22 and 47 were separated from the rest on the MDS plot [See Additional file 2: Figure S1 ]. However, inspection of raw sequence data and mapping parameters did not identify any technical problems which would explain the observed out-grouping of these birds. In addition an interclass principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using raw and normalized gene counts. The interclass PCA revealed that the birds 22 and 47 were placed outside the 95 % confidence intervals of their respective treatments [See Additional file 3: Figure S2 ]. However, the PCA did not identify any gene having extreme count profiles which may have contributed to the transcriptome dispersion of birds 22 and 47 with respect to their treatment groups. Although there was no clear technical or biological explanation for their out-grouping, these samples were removed from further analysis. Differential gene expression analysis was performed to compare the two chicken lines (L10L and L10H) at two time points for uninfected (C1 and C2, see Fig. 1 ) and IBV-infected birds (C3 and C4, see Fig. 1 ). A large number of genes were differentially expressed (DE) between L10L and L10H lines at weeks 1 and 3, for both uninfected and IBV-infected birds (see Table 1 , see Fig. 1 ). We identified 1,698 and 1,424 DE genes for the uninfected birds between lines L10L and L10H at weeks 1 and 3, respectively (see Table 1 ). In total 692 genes had higher expression in L10H line and 1,006 had higher expression in line L10L for the uninfected birds at week 1 [See Additional file 4: Table S2 ] and 774 genes had higher expression in L10H line and 650 genes had higher expression in L10L line for uninfected birds at week 3 [See Additional file 5: Table S3 ]. Comparing IBV-infected L10H and L10L birds, we identified 1,934 and 866 DE genes at weeks 1 and 3, respectively (see Table 1 ). In total 931 genes had higher expression in line L10H and 1,003 had higher expression in line L10L at week 1 and at week 3, 508 had higher expression in line L10H and 358 had higher expression in line L10L (Table 1 , Additional file 6: Table S4 and Additional file 7: Table S5 ). There were also status-related changes in gene expression as shown in the Venn diagram ( Fig. 2) . At week 1, the total number of DE genes in uninfected birds Fig. 2 ).

A list of paragraphs is provided as context to help you answer the question.Question: Is p100 the precursor protein molecule of the NF-kappaB transcription factor subunit p50?Context: We previously reported that alymphoplasia (aly/aly) mice, which have a natural loss-of-function mutation in the Nik gene, which encodes a kinase essential for the processing of p100 to p52 in the alternative nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, show mild osteopetrosis with an increase in several parameters of bone formation:Proteolytic processing of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 generates the active NF-kappaB2 subunit p52, which in turn transcriptionally up-regulates p100 expression.The mammalian Rel/NF-kappaB family of transcription factors, including RelA, c-Rel, RelB, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), and NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), plays a central role in the immune system by regulating several processes ranging from the development and survival of lymphocytes and lymphoid organs to the control of immune responses and malignant transformation.NF-kappaB functions as a hetero- or homo-dimer which can be formed from five NF-kappaB subunits, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), RelA (p65), RelB and c-Rel.The non-canonical pathway based on processing of NF-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 plays a critical role in controlling B cell function and lymphoid organogenesis.Processing of NF-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 is tightly controlled, which is important for proper function of NF-kappaB.Processing of NF-kappa B2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 is tightly regulated.Processing of the NF-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 is an important step of NF-kappaB regulation.Targeted disruption of the Rel/NF-kappaB family members NF-kappaB2, encoding p100/p52, and RelB in mice results in anatomical defects of secondary lymphoid tissues.Here, we show that in T cells infected with the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), IKKalpha is targeted to a novel signaling pathway that mediates processing of the nfkappab2 precursor protein p100, resulting in active production of the NF-kappaB subunit, p52.nfkb2 encodes two members of the NF-kappa B/Rel family of proteins: p52 and p100. The p100 polypeptide has been proposed to serve as a precursor of p52, which corresponds to the N-terminal half of p100.In most cells, small amounts of p52 are produced relative to the levels of p100, unlike the usually balanced production of nfkb1-derived p50 and p105.The alternative or second pathway proceeded via NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK)-, IKKalpha-, and protein synthesis-dependent processing of the inhibitory NF-kappaB2 p100 precursor protein to the p52 form and resulted in a delayed but sustained activation of primarily RelB-containing NF-kappaB dimers.In one exceptional case, generation of the p50 subunit of the transcriptional regulator NF-kappaB, the precursor protein p105 is processed in a limited manner: the N-terminal domain yields the p50 subunit, whereas the C-terminal domain is degradedProteolytic processing of the p105 precursor (NF-kappa B1) generates the p50 subunit of NF-kappa Bp105 (NFKB1) acts in a dual way as a cytoplasmic IkappaB molecule and as the source of the NF-kappaB p50 subunit upon processingThe p50 subunit of NF-kappa B is derived from the amino terminus of a 105 kilodalton precursorRegulation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB involves proteasome-mediated processing of the NF-kappaB1 p105 precursor protein, which generates the p50 subunit of NF-kappaBThis effort identified NF-kappaB1 (p105), an atypical IkappaB molecule and the precursor of NF-kappaB subunit p50NF-kappaB functions as a hetero- or homo-dimer which can be formed from five NF-kappaB subunits, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), RelA (p65), RelB and c-RelThe mammalian Rel/NF-kappaB family of transcription factors, including RelA, c-Rel, RelB, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), and NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), plays a central role in the immune system by regulating several processes ranging from the development and survival of lymphocytes and lymphoid organs to the control of immune responses and malignant transformation","answer":"no"},{"question":"Examine the provided complex phrase and categorize every term based on its grammatical function, considering punctuations, conjunctions and prepositions.

Beyond the point you\'ve mentioned, singletons can result in multiple instances due to the following:1. Serialization: If the singleton class implements the Serializable interface, upon deserialization, a new instance of the class will be created leading to two instances of a singleton class.    - Prevention -> Implement the readResolve method in the singleton class.2. Reflection: It can be used to create multiple instances of singleton class by calling the private constructor.   - Prevention -> Throw a runtime exception in the constructor if the instance already exists.3. Cloning: If the singleton class implements the Cloneable interface, then creating a clone of the singleton object will result in a new instance.   - Prevention -> Override the clone method and throw an exception from it to prevent cloning.4. Multithreaded Environment: In a multithreaded environment, if two threads invoke the getInstance method simultaneously when the singleton instance is null, they both move ahead to create an instance of the singleton class, resulting in two objects of a singleton class.   - Prevention -> Use of synchronized keyword in getInstance() method.5. Loading by different Class Loaders: Class instances are scoped by the Class Loader instances that loaded them, hence if two different Class Loader instances load the Singleton class, two distinct Singleton instances would be created.   - Prevention -> Mostly occurs when working with complex systems (like web-applications), for typical Java applications Class Loaders shouldn\'t become a problem.6. Subclassing: Singleton classes generally have a private constructor which can be inherited in a subclass thus creating multiple instances.   - Prevention -> Make the singleton class final.These additional points should complement your already mentioned \'instance()\'."},{"question":"Given an erroneous piece of Python code, identify the bugs, correct them, and modify the code to successfully parse a complex JSON document.

In these cases the tab order is set by the dialog template and there is no obvious way to change the tab order by including a newly created control.","answer":"Yes, it is possible to dynamically add a control to a dialog and adjust its position (tab order) in the tab navigation sequence. In order to make it happen, you need to manage the Z-order of the controls in the dialog. The tab order is determined by the Z-order, with the \\"top\\" control (the one at the end of the Z-order list) having the first tab position, the one after it the second position and so on. Here\'s a rough example:```cpp// Assumed HWND hDlg is the handle to your dialog, ID_FIRSTCONTROL is the ID of existing control that // you want the new control to be tabbed to afterHWND hwndFirstCtrl = GetDlgItem(hDlg, ID_FIRSTCONTROL);HWND hwndNewCtrl = CreateWindow(...); //Create your new control// Now we set the new control to follow the existing control in the Z order, thus making it follow in the tab order.SetWindowPos(hwndNewCtrl, hwndFirstCtrl, 0, 0, 0, 0, SWP_NOMOVE | SWP_NOSIZE);```Remember, tab order also considers WS_TABSTOP style. Therefore, your new control must have the WS_TABSTOP style flag set, as all controls participating in the tab sequence must have this style. Otherwise, it will be simply skipped when moving through the dialog with the Tab key.```cppSetWindowLongPtr(hwndNewCtrl, GWL_STYLE, GetWindowLongPtr(hwndNewCtrl, GWL_STYLE) | WS_TABSTOP);```Please replace \\"CreateWindow(...)\\" and the IDs with your own respective code/function calls and IDs.

DESIGN Five hundred eighty-five IVF-ET cycles were prospect ively studied for the occurrence of plasma P elevation before hCG administration . SETTING Tertiary institution , IVF-ET program , Hôpital A. Béclère . PATIENTS Participating patients included IVF-ET c and i date s 23 to 42 years of age only , excluding the couples in whom a male factor was a primary or an accessory cause of infertility . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES To clarify the practical consequences on IVF-ET outcome of pre-hCG increases in plasma P , we studied 585 consecutive IVF-ET cycles . These were divided into two groups according to plasma P levels observed on the day of hCG administration ; plasma P of 0.9 ng/mL ( 2.9 nmol/L ) was taken as an arbitrary cutoff value . Group A included 485 IVF cycles in which plasma P was < or = 0.9 ng/mL ( 2.9 nmol/L ) ; group B included the remaining 100 cycles in which plasma P was > 0.9 ng/mL ( 2.9 nmol/L ) . RESULTS The number of mature oocytes retrieved , the oocyte cleavage rate , and the number of embryos obtained were similar in groups A and B. In contrast to this apparent similarity in oocyte quality , a decrease in pregnancy rate ( PR ) and a trend for a decrease in embryo implantation rate were observed in group B in comparison with group A. CONCLUSIONS The similar fertilization and cleavage rates obtained in groups A and B suggest that pre-hCG elevation in plasma P does not lead to decreased oocyte quality . Yet the lower PR observed when plasma P rises prematurely suggests that the prolonged but discrete elevation in plasma P occurring in these cases might alter endometrium receptivity to embryo implantationTitle 2:Premature luteinization during gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist cycles and its relationship with in vitro fertilization outcome.Abstract 2:OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence and the effect of premature luteinization in  GnRH antagonist IVF-ET cycles . DESIGN Prospect i ve observational study . SETTING In vitro fertilization-embryo transfer ( IVF-ET ) program at the Instituto Valenciano de Infertilidad . PATIENT(S ) Eighty-one infertile patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with gonadotropins and GnRH antagonist for IVF-ET .  INTERVENTION(S ) Gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) antagonist was administered from stimulation day 6 . Serum P , E(2 ) , and LH were determined on the day of hCG administration . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S ) Cycles were grouped according to serum P level on the day of hCG administration ( < 1.2 ng/mL or > or = 1.2 ng/mL ) . Clinical pregnancy and implantation rates were determined . RESULT ( S ) The incidence of premature luteinization was 38.3 % . Total recombinant FSH dose and stimulation days differed significantly between the groups . Pregnancy rate ( 25.8 % vs. 54.0 % ) and implantation rate ( 13.8 % vs. 32.0 % ) were significantly lower in the premature luteinization group . CONCLUSION ( S ) Premature luteinization during GnRH antagonist IVF-ET cycles is a frequent event that is associated with lower pregnancy and implantation rates . Progesterone elevations are not related to serum LH levels and may reflect the mature granulosa cell response to high FSH exposureTitle 3:Premature luteinization in in vitro fertilization cycles using gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) and recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and GnRH-a and urinary FSH.Abstract 3:OBJECTIVE To determine if premature luteinization can occur in  GnRH agonist ( GnRH-a ) and FSH ( recombinant FSH and human urinary FSH ) IVF cycles and whether premature luteinization affects IVF and clinical outcome . DESIGN Retrospective evaluation of 171 IVF-ET cycles . The cycles were divided into two groups according to the P level on the day of hCG : group I ( serum P < /= 0.9 ng/mL [ conversion factor to SI unit , 3.180 ] ) and group II ( serum P > /= 1.1 ng/mL ) . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Comparison of cycles characteristics and of cumulative exposure of follicular serum E2 , FSH , LH , and P  as well as of IVF and clinical outcome were made between the study groups . RESULTS Twenty-three of the 171 cycles ( 13.4 % ) demonstrated premature luteinization . The age of the patients , the E2 , and LH exposure were similar between the groups . The number of the ampules of gonadotropins ( recombinant FSH and urinary FSH ) used and the area under FSH and P curve were higher in cycles with premature luteinization . The area under the FSH curve correlated with the area under the P curve . Similar IVF and clinical outcomes were observed in cycles with and without premature luteinization . CONCLUSION The greater FSH exposure and its correlation with the P exposure suggest that one of the possible factors inducing premature luteinization is the increased FSH-induced LH receptivity in granulosa cells . No adverse effects of premature luteinization on the IVF and clinical outcome were observedTitle 4:Reduced implantation rate associated with a subtle rise in serum progesterone concentration during the follicular phase of cycles stimulated with a combination of a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist and gonadotrophin.Abstract 4:Our objective was to assess the effects of subtle increases in serum progesterone concentration ( 1.0 - 2.0 ng/ml ) on the outcome of in-vitro fertilization ( IVF ) , particularly on the quality of embryos , during the follicular phase of cycles stimulated with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist ( GnRHa ) and human menopausal gonadotrophin ( HMG ) . A total of 97 patients underwent 116 cycles of IVF  and were stimulated with a combination of HMG and GnRHa . They were divided into two groups : those with a subtle progesterone rise and those with no progesterone rise . The two groups were compared with respect to serum oestradiol , progesterone , immunoreactive luteinizing hormone ( I-LH ) , bioactive LH ( B-LH ) , and results of IVF . The groups did not differ significantly in mean age or in total dose of HMG received . On the day that human chorionic gonadotrophin was administered , concentrations of oestradiol and progesterone were significantly higher in the subtle progesterone rise cycles than in the no progesterone rise cycles . In the no progesterone rise cycles , the percentages for embryos beyond the 4-cell stage , grade 1 embryos , and implantation rates were significantly higher than those in subtle progesterone rise cycles . The combination of GnRHa and HMG eliminated any significant rise in serum I-LH or B-LH concentration during the follicular phase , but did not suppress the subtle rise in progesterone . These results confirm our previous finding that a subtle progesterone rise adversely affects the outcome of IVF . It is also suggested that a reduction in embryo quality may influence the lower rate of implantation in subtle progesterone rise cyclesTitle 5:Lower pregnancy rate with premature luteinization during pituitary suppression with leuprolide acetate.Abstract 5:The relationship of the circulating level of progesterone ( P ) on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) injection to occurrence of clinical pregnancy was examined in 133 leuprolide acetate human menopausal gonadotropin ( hMG ) in vitro fertilization cycles in women having at least three embryos transferred .  Progesterone concentrations greater than 0.5 ng/mL were associated with a significantly lower rate of pregnancy ( 12/59 , 20 % ) compared with less than 0.5 ng/mL ( 40/74 , 54 % , P less than 0.005 ) . The higher P cycles were associated with greater patient age and hMG dose , although these relationships appeared to be indirect . Luteinizing hormone ( LH ) concentrations remained suppressed . Ovarian stimulation may cause excessive luteinization and an adverse cycle outcome even in the presence of low LH levels . Prospect i ve use of P levels may be helpful to determine optimal hCG timing","answer":"In conclusion , the best available evidence does not support an association between progesterone elevation on the day of hCG administration and the probability of clinical pregnancy in women undergoing ovarian stimulation with GnRH analogues and gonadotrophins for IVF"},{"question":"Implement a Random Forest classifier in python from scratch without using any machine learning libraries. Additionally, include functionality for handling missing data and feature scaling.","answer":"Building a Random Forest classifier from scratch can be a bit complex as it requires first understanding and building a Decision Tree algorithm and bootstrap aggregating (bagging) method. Here, I will give an overview of how to begin implementing these concepts, but it won\'t include full code due to its complexity.1. Decision tree:To create a random forest, we need a decision tree. We know that a decision tree uses a tree graph to illustrate possible decisions and their chance outcomes. ```pythonclass DecisionTree(object):    def __init__(self, x, y, idxs = None, min_leaf=2):        if idxs is None: idxs=np.arange(len(y))        self.x,self.y,self.idxs,self.min_leaf = x,y,idxs,min_leaf        self.n,self.c = len(idxs), x.shape[1]        self.val = np.mean(y[idxs])        self.score = float(\'inf\')        self.find_varsplit()```In the first line of `__init__` we\'re storing our data (x) and our output (y)... and so forth.2. Random forest:Once we have coded a decision tree, we can create multiple trees and make them vote for the final decision, which is the basic concept of random forest.```pythonclass RandomForest():    def __init__(self, x, y, n_trees, sample_sz, min_leaf=5):        np.random.seed(42)        if len(y.shape) == 1: y = np.array(y).reshape(-1,1)                    self.x,self.y,self.sample_sz,self.min_leaf = x,y,sample_sz,min_leaf        self.trees = [self.create_tree() for i in range(n_trees)]    def create_tree(self):        idxs = np.random.permutation(len(self.y))[:self.sample_sz]        return DecisionTree(self.x.iloc[idxs], self.y[idxs], idxs=np.array(range(self.sample_sz)), min_leaf=self.min_leaf)            def predict(self, x):        return np.mean([t.predict(x) for t in self.trees], axis=0)```3. Handling Missing values:For missing data, we implement in the node\'s decision function. If the feature for a specific sample point is missing, we compute the results for left child and right child respectively, and then combine them with the weights (the proportion of samples in left and right child).```pythondef find_varsplit(self):    for i in range(self.c): self.find_better_split(i)    def find_better_split(self, var_idx):    x,y = self.x.values[self.idxs,var_idx], self.y[self.idxs]    sort_idx = np.argsort(x)    sort_y,sort_x = y[sort_idx], x[sort_idx]    ...    for i in range(0,self.n-self.min_leaf-1):        xi,yi = sort_x[i],sort_y[i]        if i<self.min_leaf or xi==sort_x[i-1]:            continue        lhs = np.nonzero(sort_x<=xi)[0].shape[0]        ...```4. Feature scaling:Feature scaling can be performed in the preprocessing step before inputting data into the classifier. One common method of feature scaling is standardization, which involves subtracting the mean value of a feature and dividing by its standard deviation.```pythondef normalize_features(self, X):    mean = np.mean(X, axis=0)    std = np.std(X, axis=0)    X = (X - mean) / std    return X```Again, this goes beyond the scope of this response and requires a comprehensive understanding of machine learning and advanced programming skills. I would highly recommend using libraries like scikit-learn which have efficient implementations of these algorithms.Please note implementing algorithms from scratch is not recommended for production level code as it is error-prone, inefficient and hard to maintain. They are used mainly for learning purposes."},{"question":"Construct a Python method that accepts an ASCII input string and a number \'n\' as parameters, and produces an output providing \'n\' distinct permutations of the characters included, with no repetition of the same permutation.","answer":"In order to solve this problem, we can use python `itertools` library, which has a function `permutations` to generate all permutations of a given list. However, directly assigning \'n\' to this function might result in non-distinct elements to be returned. Therefore, we need to create a separate function to return \'n\' distinct permutations of any given string.Here is a Python method that accomplishes this:```pythonfrom itertools import permutations def distinct_permutations(string,n):  ## Generate all permutations  perms = list(permutations(string))      ## Remove duplicates by converting to set and then back to list  perms = list(set(perms))  ## if n is larger than the number of distinct permutations   ## then return all permutations  if n > len(perms):    return [\'\'.join(p) for p in perms]  ## Return first \'n\' distinct permutations  else:    return [\'\'.join(perms[i]) for i in range(n)]```You can run the function with a string and an integer as follows:```pythonprint(distinct_permutations(\\"abc\\",4))#this might print out [\'abc\', \'acb\', \'bac\', \'bca\'] #possible outputs can vary because sets are unordered```Please note that, this function first generates all possible permutations, and then discards the duplicates. If the input string is long, this might cause time and space inefficiency. Because permutations grow factorially with the length of the string. Therefore I recommend using this function with small strings. Also, the output could be in any order since sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements."},{"question":"How can the principles of Quantum Entanglement and Quantum Decoherence be harnessed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of advanced artificial intelligence systems, particularly when interacting with large, high-dimensional data sets teeming with numerous variables?

Enhanced parallel processing: Quantum entanglement facilitates a pool of qubits to function as an extensive network where data can be processed simultaneously, rather than consecutively. It leads to an exponential growth in processing power as every added qubit doubles the computational capacity.2. Improve data modeling: High dimensional data sets with numerous variables often present a challenge of modeling complexity in conventional AI systems. Quantum entanglement can potentially capture correlations among multiple variables, even in a complex system, which can result in a more detailed model of the system.Quantum decoherence, on the other hand, can be used to combat the impact of the surrounding environment on quantum systems, a key issue in practical quantum computing applications. This could enhance the stability and reliability of computational operations in an AI context.For a layered cognitive reasoning framework, these quantum effects can:1. Enhance pattern recognition: Quantum systems can contain many possible patterns due to their superposition principle, which could aid in improved pattern recognition in a layered cognitive framework, improving performance and results.2. Facilitate multi-tiered thinking: Quantum systems can hold multiple states simultaneously, potentially supporting AI\'s multitier thinking and problem-solving capabilities.Preserving data authenticity can be achieved by applying principles of Quantum Cryptography. Additionally, Quantum Error Correction schemes can be used to rectify the errors caused due to environmental interference or system faults ensuring data integrity and authenticity.The dynamic nature of data and increasing complexity of AI models could potentially be managed by taking advantage of the unique properties of quantum systems such as superposition and entanglement. Also, quantum annealing methods can be utilized for instantaneous adjustments in dynamic data.Overall, Quantum computing and AI are rich fields with much potential for synergistic interaction.

Also include clear strategies to deal with memory leaks and circular reference problems. Demonstrate your understanding of how garbage collection works under the hood by detailing how your system operates.","answer":"The task of creating a large-scale application that includes a custom garbage collector in Java is beyond the scope of this platform. However, I will be able to provide a high-level idea of how it can be implemented and details about how garbage collection in Java works.A garbage collector can be implemented using weak and soft references in Java. These references are from `java.lang.ref` package. 1. `WeakReference`: An object is weakly reachable when the garbage collector finds no normal references, but at least one path to the object through a weak reference. It can be implemented in Java as following:    ```java    WeakReference<Object> weakReference = new WeakReference<Object>(new Object());    ```    After this we can call `System.gc()`, after that object will be collected.2. `SoftReference`: An object is softly reachable when it is not strongly reachable but can be reached by traversing a soft reference. As compared to `WeakReference`, `SoftReference` objects are cleared only when the JVM is low on memory and absolutely need memory to be freed up.    ```java    SoftReference<Object> softReference = new SoftReference<Object>(new Object());    ```   After that we can call `System.gc()`, but this time object will not collected, until JVM don\'t need to reclaim some memory.Building a custom garbage collector will typically involve interactions with these reference types. You need to clean up your unused objects timely, properly use `equals()` and `hashcode()` methods, understand the scope of objects, and avoid the finalization of objects.For handling memory leaks and circular reference problems:- Memory Leaks: In Java, memory leaks are generally due to unwanted references. If an object is no more used, it should be unreferenced so that GC can free the associated memory. However, sometimes, developers do not unreferenced these unused objects and they remain in the memory which causes a memory leak.- Circular References: Java\'s garbage collector is smart enough and can handle circular dependencies by using a technique called mark-and-sweep. Whenever all references to a group of objects are dropped (even if they reference each other), the garbage collector can still deallocate them.For understanding how the garbage collection works under the hood, here are the key points:- When an object is created, it is assigned memory space in the heap section of the JVM.- JVM includes a GC module which automatically reclaims memory from the objects that are no longer in use.- Garbage collection involves the process of deallocating memory automatically, without explicit user instructions.Java\'s garbage collector is a mark-and-sweep collector, working in two stages:1. Mark Phase: Here the collector runs through the heap and marks all objects that are reachable, i.e., any objects that could be found along a chain of references that start from the \\"roots\\" (which are local variables and some static variables).2. Sweep Phase: This phase goes through the heap and reclaims all the unmarked objects.Note: Explicitly calling `System.gc()` does not guarantee that the garbage collector will run immediately. The garbage collector operates in the background, and it will decide when to run based on various parameters such as the size of the heap, how much memory is being used, etc.This is just an overview, actual implementation would require careful planning, design and extensive coding. Please consult experts or a senior team member while implementing these in production scenarios."},{"question":"do you mind converting this to go?def weighted_average_in_interval(l: list, weights: list, lower_limit: int, upper_limit: int):    weighted_sum = sum([a*b for a,b in zip(l,weights)])    weight_total = sum(weights)    average = weighted_sum / weight_total    return lower_limit <= average <= upper_limitcould you insert annotations in the go code to clarify its operation?","answer":"Sure, I can convert Python code to Golang for the method that calculates the weighted average and checks it falls in the specified interval.

In Python, you can solve this problem using a queue for BFS.Below is a Python implementation:```pythonclass Node:    def __init__(self, key):        self.data = key        self.left = None        self.right = Nonedef levelOrder(root):    if root is None:        return    # create an empty queue and enqueue root node    queue = []    queue.append(root)    # to store nodes in level order manner in a list    nodes_list = []    while len(queue) > 0:        # append front of queue to nodes_list and remove it from queue        node = queue.pop(0)        nodes_list.append(node.data)        # enqueue left child        if node.left is not None:            queue.append(node.left)        # enqueue right child        if node.right is not None:            queue.append(node.right)        return nodes_list# Driver Coderoot = Node(1)root.left = Node(2)root.right = Node(3)root.left.left = Node(4)root.left.right = Node(5)print(\\"Level Order Traversal: \\", levelOrder(root))```In the code above, we initialize a queue with the root node. We then start a loop and continue until the queue becomes empty. Within each loop iteration, we process the front node of the queue, add its data to the result list and remove it from the queue. If the processed node has a left or right child, we add them to the queue. This way, we make sure all nodes are processed level by level, from left to right, which is a level-order traversal."},{"question":"Devise an algorithm using Java to execute a meticulous search task on a pre-existing list containing distinct integers.

Sequentially detailed process, key aspects of importance including security and efficiency, potential challenges and their solutions, strategic advantages, compromises, and considerations of different deployment strategies are as follows:1. Planning and Design Phase:Key aspects to focus on include setting your goals, deciding on a schema, and planning capacity.   * Setting Goals: It\'s crucial to establish clear-cut goals concerning what you desire to achieve. This guides your data warehouse development strategy.  * Deciding on a Schema: Schema design significantly affects the query performance. Redshift supports star and snowflake schemas, among others. A carefully analyzed schema choice can lead to better query performance and quick retrieval of data.  * Planning Capacity: Estimate the amount of storage required and choose the appropriate number and types of nodes.  *Challenge:* Arriving at an accurate estimate for capacity planning may be difficult.  *Solution*: Start small and scale up as needed, making use of Amazon Redshift’s elasticity.2. Data Migration/Import Phase:Key aspects include extracting data from the source, transforming it as necessary, and loading it into Redshift.*Challenge:* Limited bandwidth may result in slow data transfer.*Solution*: Break data into chunks and load progressively. Use AWS Data Pipeline or AWS DMS to facilitate data migration.*Consideration:* Ensure source data cleansing to avoid importing unnecessary data which can lead to inefficiencies like increased storage costs and slower querying times.3. Configuration and Management Phase:Key aspects to focus include optimizing for performance, data security and backups, and managing costs.* Performance Optimization: Enable automatic workloads management (WLM) for query prioritization, make use of sort and distribution keys for faster query execution, compress columns to save space and improve performance.  * Data Security and Backups: Encrypt data at rest and in transit. Implement Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for access control. Enable automatic backups for continuity.  * Managing Costs: Use Reserved instances for predictable workloads to save costs.*Challenge:* Maintaining performance while keeping costs low and ensuring data security can be challenging.*Solution:* Regularly monitor performance metrics, adjust resources as necessary, automate wherever possible, and make sure that all actions comply with the security policy.4. Testing, Deployment, and Iteration Phase:Before full implementation, perform testing to ensure that data integrity is preserved, the system can handle the desired load and queries return expected results.During deployment, start with a small set of users before rolling out to all users.Iterate continuously after deployment, reassessing needs, managing system performance, and making necessary adjustments.Overall, using Amazon Redshift as a data warehouse provides the advantages of scalability, flexible pricing, advanced query optimization, and integration with diverse AWS services. However, considerations like the complexity of schema design, the need for data cleansing, performance optimization, and data security must be handled diligently."},{"question":"With a calendar spread (buying back, selling front), max loss is defined as some variant of \\"maximum potential loss is the cost of opening the trade (Premium Paid − Premium Received = Total Debit)\\"What is the intuition/rationale behind this being the max loss? (edit: assuming that the position is closed when the short expiry occurs)","answer":"A calendar spread involves buying and selling call or put options (depending on the strategy) with the same strike price but different expiration dates. Generally, the investor simultaneously sells an option with a shorter expiration date (front-month option) and buys another option with a longer expiration date (back-month option).The maximum loss in a calendar spread will occur if the price of the underlying security is at or near the strike price of the options when the near-term option expires.Here\'s why this is the case:1. If the price of the underlying security is at the strike price when the near-term option expires, the option you sold will be worthless. This means you won\'t owe anything to the person who bought that option from you.2. However, the longer-dated option you bought will also be worth little because it still has time value left but the price of the underlying security hasn\'t moved much. This means you won\'t earn much from selling or exercising this option.3. Therefore, your maximum loss will be the net premium you initially paid to set up the spread. This premium is the cost of the longer-dated option you bought minus the proceeds from the short-dated option you sold.4. The maximum loss is realized at this point because the spread can\'t be worth less than zero. Even if the price of the underlying falls even further, your loss would still be capped at the initial net premium you paid.5. If the price of the underlying moves significantly in either direction, the spread will start to earn a profit. This is because the long option will rise in value faster than the short option due to its longer time to expiration.6. Therefore, in a calendar spread, the maximum loss is fundamentally constrained to the net premium paid for the spread."},{"question":"First of all, I\'m lumping LDA in with Naive Bayes because LDA is a special case of Naive Bayes.I read in ISLR that Naive Bayes and LDA are good for instances where you have a small amount of N datapoints and/or a large amount of features.

This also makes sense since LDA is a dimensionality reduction technique.However, now I\'m seeing that \\"classical methods\\" are only meant to be used when  N datapoints > N features? Please help me reconcile.Exhibit 1:--------------------------[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/12iiU.png)Exhibit 2:--------------------------[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/TZ2Mk.png)","answer":"Naive Bayes and LDA models can be used both in high-dimensional settings and in cases where you have more observation points than features. Whether to use one or the other depends on the specific structure of your data and problem.1. High-dimensional settings: Both Naive Bayes and LDA can handle high-dimensional data well. Naive Bayes does this by assuming feature independence, while LDA reduces the dimensionality into a more manageable number of linear combinations. These models can be useful if you have a large number of features compared to the number of data points (P >> N), where regular regression techniques may falter due to overfitting.2. More data points than features: On the other hand, if you have more data points than features (N >> P), classical methods such as linear regression may be more suitable. This is because these methods can capitalize on the greater amount of data to yield more precise estimates, while Naive Bayes and LDA might not fully utilize the information available due to simplicity of the model or assumptions made. The key is to choose the model that is most suitable to your specific problem, given the structure and volume of your data. In practice, often a model is chosen based on its performance on a validation or testing set. The assumptions that different models make about the data often guide initial model choice, and further modifications can be made as necessary to improve performance. Finally, I would also like to clarify that LDA is not exactly a special case of Naive Bayes, they are quite different in their assumptions and model forms. LDA assumes that the input data for each class is drawn from a multivariate Gaussian distribution with class-specific means and a covariance that is common to all classes, whereas Naive Bayes typically assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the class label."},{"question":"Develop the QuickSort algorithm in Python, providing optimization for avoiding worst case scenarios, that effectively sorts a list of integers. Apply this to the following integer list: [4, 2, 5, 3, 1]","answer":"The QuickSort algorithm can be implemented in Python as follows. The optimization used here to avoid the worst case performing scenario is to choose the pivot as the median of the first, middle and last elements of the list.```pythondef quicksort(arr):    if len(arr) <= 1:        return arr    else:        pivot = find_pivot(arr)        less_than_pivot = [x for x in arr[1:] if x <= pivot]        greater_than_pivot = [x for x in arr[1:] if x > pivot]        return quicksort(less_than_pivot) + [pivot] + quicksort(greater_than_pivot)def find_pivot(arr):    mid = len(arr)//2    pivot_candidates = [arr[0], arr[mid], arr[-1]]    pivot_candidates.sort()    return pivot_candidates[1]numbers = [4, 2, 5, 3, 1]print(quicksort(numbers))```Running the above code will sort the `numbers` list in ascending order.Please note that this implementation uses some Python shortcuts (like for example list comprehensions), and uses a bit more memory than a conventional in-place QuickSort algorithm, but it makes the code much more readable. Also, finding the pivot in this way is a a good way to improve the performance for certain (especially worst-case) inputs, but for a theoretical worst-case it still might perform in O(n^2) - to completely avoid such a situation we would need to e.g. shuffle the list at random, which would give us a probabilistic guarantee for O(n log n) runtime.If you wanted a version of QuickSort that sorts in-place (i.e., without creating new lists), that implementation would be a bit more complex and would involve swapping elements in the array and would use more of loop constructs rather than list comprehensions."},{"question":"Develop a Java program that not only calculates the probability of rolling a pair of dice and getting the number 8, but also simulates the process of rolling a pair of dice 10,000 times to empirically verify the calculated probability.

Theoretical calculation of probability is based on arithmetic and may not always take into account physical factors.3. The empirical probability is simulated over 10,000 rolls. The number 10,000 is large enough for the Law of Large Numbers to kick in and should provide a good approximation over multiple runs of the simulation.This program will print something like this:```Theoretical Probability: 0.139Empirical Probability: 0.136```The empirical probability will vary each time you run the simulation because it involves randomness.

We do not restrict the workers to detailed scripts or to a small knowledge base and hence we observe that our dataset contains more realistic and diverse conversations in comparison to existing datasets. We offer several baseline models including state of the art neural seq2seq architectures with benchmark performance as well as qualitative human evaluations. Dialogs are labeled with API calls and arguments, a simple and cost effective approach which avoids the requirement of complex annotation schema. The layer of abstraction between the dialog model and the service provider API allows for a given model to interact with multiple services that provide similar functionally. Finally, the dataset will evoke interest in written vs. spoken language, discourse patterns, error handling and other linguistic phenomena related to dialog system research, development and design.Related work ::: Human-machine vs. human-human dialogBIBREF14 discuss the major features and differences among the existing offerings in an exhaustive and detailed survey of available corpora for data driven learning of dialog systems. One important distinction covered is that of human-human vs. human-machine dialog data, each having its advantages and disadvantages. Many of the existing task-based datasets have been generated from deployed dialog systems such as the Let’s Go Bus Information System BIBREF15 and the various Dialog State Tracking Challenges (DSTCs) BIBREF16. However, it is doubtful that new data-driven systems built with this type of corpus would show much improvement since they would be biased by the existing system and likely mimic its limitations BIBREF17. Since the ultimate goal is to be able to handle complex human language behaviors, it would seem that human-human conversational data is the better choice for spoken dialog system development BIBREF13. However, learning from purely human-human based corpora presents challenges of its own. In particular, human conversation has a different distribution of understanding errors and exhibits turn-taking idiosyncrasies which may not be well suited for interaction with a dialog system BIBREF17, BIBREF14.The Taskmaster Corpus ::: OverviewThere are several key attributes that make Taskmaster-1 both unique and effective for data-driven approaches to building dialog systems and for other research.Spoken and written dialogs: While the spoken sources more closely reflect conversational language BIBREF20, written dialogs are significantly cheaper and easier to gather. This allows for a significant increase in the size of the corpus and in speaker diversity.Goal-oriented dialogs: All dialogs are based on one of six tasks: ordering pizza, creating auto repair appointments, setting up rides for hire, ordering movie tickets, ordering coffee drinks and making restaurant reservations.Two collection methods: The two-person dialogs and self-dialogs each have pros and cons, revealing interesting contrasts.Multiple turns: The average number of utterances per dialog is about 23 which ensures context-rich language behaviors.API-based annotation: The dataset uses a simple annotation schema providing sufficient grounding for the data while making it easy for workers to apply labels consistently.Size: The total of 13,215 dialogs in this corpus is on par with similar, recently released datasets such as MultiWOZ BIBREF13.The Taskmaster Corpus ::: Two-person, spoken datasetIn order to replicate a two-participant, automated digital assistant experience, we built a WOz platform that pairs agents playing the digital assistant with crowdsourced workers playing the user in task-based conversational scenarios. An example dialog from this dataset is given in Figure FIGREF5.The Taskmaster Corpus ::: Two-person, spoken dataset ::: WOz platform and data pipelineWhile it is beyond the scope of this work to describe the entire system in detail, there are several platform features that help illustrate how the process works.Modality: The agents playing the assistant type their input which is in turn played to the user via text-to-speech (TTS) while the crowdsourced workers playing the user speak aloud to the assistant using their laptop and microphone. We use WebRTC to establish the audio channel. This setup creates a digital assistant-like communication style.Conversation and user quality control: Once the task is completed, the agents tag each conversation as either successful or problematic depending on whether the session had technical glitches or user behavioral issues. We are also then able to root out problematic users based on this logging.Agent quality control: Agents are required to login to the system which allows us to monitor performance including the number and length of each session as well as their averages.User queuing: When there are more users trying to connect to the system than available agents, a queuing mechanism indicates their place in line and connects them automatically once they move to the front of the queue.Transcription: Once complete, the user\'s audio-only portion of the dialog is transcribed by a second set of workers and then merged with the assistant\'s typed input to create a full text version of the dialog. Finally, these conversations are checked for transcription errors and typos and then annotated, as described in Section SECREF48.The Taskmaster Corpus ::: Two-person, spoken dataset ::: Agents, workers and trainingBoth agents and crowdsourced workers are given written instructions prior to the session. Examples of each are given in Figure FIGREF6 and Figure FIGREF23. The instructions continue to be displayed on screen to the crowdsourced workers while they interact with the assistant. Instructions are modified at times (for either participant or both) to ensure broader coverage of dialog scenarios that are likely to occur in actual user-assistant interactions. For example, in one case users were asked to change their mind after ordering their first item and in another agents were instructed to tell users that a given item was not available. Finally, in their instructions, crowdsourced workers playing the user are told they will be engaging in conversation with “a digital assistant”. However, it is plausible that some suspect human intervention due to the advanced level of natural language understanding from the assistant side.Agents playing the assistant role were hired from a pool of dialog analysts and given two hours of training on the system interface as well as on how to handle specific scenarios such as uncooperative users and technical glitches. Uncooperative users typically involve those who either ignored agent input or who rushed through the conversation with short phrases. Technical issues involved dropped sessions (e.g. WebRTC connections failed) or cases in which the user could not hear the agent or vice-versa. In addition, weekly meetings were held with the agents to answer questions and gather feedback on their experiences. Agents typically work four hours per day with dialog types changing every hour. Crowdsourced workers playing the user are accessed using Amazon Mechanical Turk. Payment for a completed dialog session lasting roughly five to seven minutes was typically in the range of 1.00 to 1.30. Problematic users are detected either by the agent involved in the specific dialog or by post-session assessment and removed from future requests.The Taskmaster Corpus ::: Self-dialogs (one-person written dataset) ::: Task scenarios and instructionsTargeting the same six tasks used for the two-person dialogs, we again engaged the Amazon Mechanical Turk worker pool to create self-dialogs, this time as a written exercise. In this case, users are asked to pretend they have a personal assistant who can help them take care of various tasks in real time. They are told to imagine a scenario in which they are speaking to their assistant on the phone while the assistant accesses the services for one of the given tasks. They then write down the entire conversation. Figure FIGREF34 shows a sample set of instructions.The Taskmaster Corpus ::: Self-dialogs (one-person written dataset) ::: Pros and cons of self-dialogsThe self-dialog technique renders quality data and avoids some of the challenges seen with the two-person approach. To begin, since the same person is writing both sides of the conversation, we never see misunderstandings that lead to frustration as is sometimes experienced between interlocutors in the two-person approach. In addition, all the self-dialogs follow a reasonable path even when the user is constructing conversations that include understanding errors or other types of dialog glitches such as when a particular choice is not available. As it turns out, crowdsourced workers are quite effective at recreating various types of interactions, both error-free and those containing various forms of linguistic repair. The sample dialog in Figure FIGREF44 shows the result of a self-dialog exercise in which workers were told to write a conversation with various ticket availability issues that is ultimately unsuccessful.Two more benefits of the self-dialog approach are its efficiency and cost effectiveness. We were able to gather thousands of dialogs in just days without transcription or trained agents, and spent roughly six times less per dialog. Despite these advantages, the self-dialog written technique cannot recreate the disfluencies and other more complex error patterns that occur in the two-person spoken dialogs which are important for model accuracy and coverage.Dataset Analysis ::: Self-dialogs vs Two-personIn this section, we quantitatively compare 5k conversations each of self-dialogs (Section SECREF45) and two-person (Section SECREF31). From Table TABREF50, we find that self-dialogs exhibit higher perplexity ( almost 3 times) compared to the two-person conversations suggesting that self-dialogs are more diverse and contains more non-conventional conversational flows which is inline with the observations in Section-SECREF47. While the number of unique words are higher in the case of self-dialogs, conversations are longer in the two-person conversations. We also report metrics by training a single model on both the datasets together.Dataset Analysis ::: Baseline Experiments: Response GenerationWe evaluate various seq2seq architectures BIBREF22 on our self-dialog corpus using both automatic evaluation metrics and human judgments. Following the recent line of work on generative dialog systems BIBREF23, we treat the problem of response generation given the dialog history as a conditional language modeling problem. Specifically we want to learn a conditional probability distribution P_{theta }(U_{t}|U_{1:t-1}) where U_{t} is the next response given dialog history U_{1:t-1}. Each utterance U_i itself is comprised of a sequence of words w_{i_1}, w_{i_2} ldots w_{i_k}. The overall conditional probability is factorized autoregressively asP_{theta }, in this work, is parameterized by a recurrent, convolution or Transformer-based seq2seq model.n-gram: We consider 3-gram and 4-gram conditional language model baseline with interpolation. We use random grid search for the best coefficients for the interpolated model.Convolution: We use the fconv architecture BIBREF24 and default hyperparameters from the fairseq BIBREF25 framework. We train the network with ADAM optimizer BIBREF26 with learning rate of 0.25 and dropout probability set to 0.2.LSTM: We consider LSTM models BIBREF27 with and without attention BIBREF28 and use the tensor2tensor BIBREF29 framework for the LSTM baselines. We use a two-layer LSTM network for both the encoder and the decoder with 128 dimensional hidden vectors.Transformer: As with LSTMs, we use the tensor2tensor framework for the Transformer model. Our Transformer BIBREF21 model uses 256 dimensions for both input embedding and hidden state, 2 layers and 4 attention heads. For both LSTMs and Transformer, we train the model with ADAM optimizer (beta _{1} = 0.85, beta _{2} = 0.997) and dropout probability set to 0.2.GPT-2: Apart from supervised seq2seq models, we also include results from pre-trained GPT-2 BIBREF30 containing 117M parameters.We evaluate all the models with perplexity and BLEU scores (Table TABREF55). Additionally, we perform two kinds of human evaluation - Ranking and Rating (LIKERT scale) for the top-3 performing models - Convolution, LSTM-attention and Transformer. For the ranking task, we randomly show 500 partial dialogs and generated responses of the top-3 models from the test set to three different crowdsourced workers and ask them to rank the responses based on their relevance to the dialog history. For the rating task, we show the model responses individually to three different crowdsourced workers and ask them to rate the responses on a 1-5 LIKERT scale based on their appropriateness to the dialog history. From Table-TABREF56, we see that inter-annotator reliability scores (Krippendorf’s Alpha) are higher for the ranking task compared to the rating task. From Table TABREF55, we see that Transformer is the best performing model on automatic evaluation metrics. It is interesting to note that there is a strong correlation between BLEU score and human ranking judgments.ConclusionTo address the lack of quality corpora for data-driven dialog system research and development, this paper introduces Taskmaster-1, a dataset that provides richer and more diverse language as compared to current benchmarks since it is based on unrestricted, task-oriented conversations involving more real-word entities. In addition, we present two data collection methodologies, both spoken and written, that ensure both speaker diversity and conversational accuracy. Our straightforward, API-oriented annotation technique is much easier for annotators to learn and simpler to apply. We give several baseline models including state-of-the-art neural seq2seq architectures, provide qualitative human performance evaluations for these models, and find that automatic evaluation metrics correlate well with human judgments.Figure 1: Sample Taskmaster-1 two-person dialogFigure 6: Indicating transaction status with “accept” or “reject”Table 3: Evaluation of various seq2seq architectures (Sutskever et al., 2014) on our self-dialog corpus using both automatic evaluation metrics and human judgments.

I know the IP address. What port number should I use? 555?  BTW: I\'m using .NET.","answer":"Ports used in networking can range from 0 to 65535. Port numbers from 0 to 1023 are the well-known ports and are restricted; they\'re reserved for privileged services and designated as well-known by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Ports from 1024 to 49151 are the registered ports, while ports from 49152 to 65535 are dynamic or private ports.If you\'re just testing a local connection, it\'s usually safe to pick a high port number (anything above 1024 is fine), just to be sure you\'re not conflicting with a port number reserved for a recognized service.However, you should check if the application you\'re going to work with uses a specific port or range of ports. References can be made to common defaults such as port 80 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS, port 22 for SSH, port 21 for FTP, and so on.In your case, you mentioned port 555, which isn\'t typically associated with any common services, so it should be safe to use for ad-hoc testing as long as it\'s not already in use within your network.In .NET you can use the `TcpClient` class to establish a socket connection to the desired IP address and port number. Here\'s a simple example of how you might do this:```C#using System.Net.Sockets;TcpClient client = new TcpClient();try{    await client.ConnectAsync(\\"192.168.1.X\\", 555); // Your IP and port number here    Console.WriteLine(\\"Connection successful\\");}catch (Exception){    Console.WriteLine(\\"Could not connect to the remote machine at the given IP and port number.\\");}finally{    client.Close();}```Remember to always call `Close` on the `TcpClient` to ensure the underlying socket is closed and memory is released.
