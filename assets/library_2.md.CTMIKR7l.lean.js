Braces: The compiler was likely confused due to misplaced closing braces \`}\` that inadvertently ended your class definition prematurely and/or began method definitions within the body of another method. 2. Method Placement: Methods like \`captureImage()\`, \`onRequestPermissionsResult()\`, \`hasCameraPermission()\`, and \`requestCameraPermission()\` should be defined within the class scope, not nested inside the method.3. Syntax: Make sure that you follow the proper Java syntax, especially regarding method and class definitions. 4. Flow of Control: Ensure the logical flow of control within your methods, particularly for permissions handling, is consistent with user interactions and the Android lifecycle.5. Formatting: Properly formatting your code can prevent such issues and make it significantly easier to spot structural and syntactical errors. Most IDEs (like Android Studio) offer auto-formatting tools that can help keep your code neat.By ensuring methods are correctly placed within the class (and not incorrectly nested within other methods), your code should now compile and run without the previously indicated errors."},{"question":"Mathias doesn't join in on the chase because he was... busy in bed with his wife. Vincent's running speed was increased by 40% when he heard... all the way from Arthur's house that he's making pasta.","answer":"This twist brings a delightful blend of humor and character-driven motivation into the high-stakes scenario of Vincent's escape with the golden apple. Here's how these humorous elements enrich the story and suggestions for weaving them seamlessly into the narrative: Mathias’s AbsenceCharacter Insight and World Building: Mathias being \\"otherwise occupied\\" during such a crucial moment can add layers to his character, suggesting his arrogance, underestimation of Vince, or possibly hinting at his detachment from the duties of leadership. This detail also subtly undermines the menacing facade of the Southern Italian Imperial Army by showcasing its leader's priorities in a comedic light.Contrast and Humor: The stark contrast between the urgency of the chase and Mathias's indifference creates a comedic juxtaposition. This can be highlighted with brief cutaways to Mathias, blissfully unaware of the chaos unfolding, while his domain is being infiltrated. Vincent’s Motivation BoostRelatable Humor: Vincent's sudden increase in speed upon hearing Arthur's pasta making all the way from his house leverages a universally relatable theme—the motivational power of food. This absurdly humorous detail not only adds a light-hearted layer to the escape but also reinforces Vince's unique characteristics and personal motivations.Character Connections: This moment offers a subtle nod to the strong connections within the group. The fact that something as ordinary as pasta can give Vince a literal \\"boost\\" speaks volumes about his relationships with the other characters, especially Arthur. It adds a touch of warmth and camaraderie amidst the tension. Suggestions for Integration- Cutaway Tactics for Humor: Employing cutaways effectively can amplify the humor and character insights without detracting from the suspense of the chase. For example, a quick cutaway to Mathias's room, juxtaposed with the intense chase sequence, could provide a moment of comic relief. Another cutaway showing Arthur in his kitchen, blissfully preparing pasta, can offer a humorous parallel to the dramatic escape.- Inner Monologue: Use Vince's inner monologue to drive home the humor and absurdity of his sudden speed boost. A quick thought bubble or two where he reflects on the ridiculousness of pasta being his motivator in such a dire situation can add depth to the humor, making it clear that even Vince is aware of and amused by the absurdity of his circumstances.- Reactions from Other Characters: If other characters witness or learn about this improbable speed boost, their reactions can add to the humor and character development. For instance, after the escape, a debriefing scene where Vince credits Arthur's pasta-making skills for his escape could lead to a mix of disbelief, laughter, and teasing from the group, reinforcing their bonds and shared history. ConclusionBy infusing Vince's escape with these humorous yet character-revealing elements, you not only entertain your readers but also deepen their connection to and appreciation for your characters. This blend of humor, character motivation, and the absurd makes for memorable storytelling that balances the heavier themes and moments of tension inherent in your narrative."},{"question":"заполнить пропускиОбязанности арендодателя.

Some of these challenges include:  1. Rapid growth: Hong Kong expects a 42% increase in project spending between 2021 and 2031, leading to a high demand for efficient project management.  2. Cost and schedule overruns: Many construction projects in Hong Kong have experienced delays and cost overruns, which have tarnished the industry's reputation.  3. Resource and labor constraints: The construction industry struggles with a shortage of skilled labor and resources, making it difficult to meet the growing demand for new projects.  4. Complex mega-projects: Large-scale, complex mega-projects bring significant risks and challenges for project managers, from increased costs and timeframes to potential quality issues.  5. Environmental sustainability: As Hong Kong continues to develop, there is a growing need for environmentally sustainable practices in the construction industry.- Discuss the increasing project costs and risks in megaprojects: Mega-projects are characterized by their high levels of complexity, scale, and risks. There has been a consistent trend of cost overruns, delays, and quality issues in such projects around the world. The reasons behind these issues include, but are not limited to:  1. Poor project planning and estimation: Mega-projects often face issues with inaccurate cost and schedule estimates, leading to miscalculations in budgets and resources.  2. Inadequate risk management: Mega-projects involve multiple risks, such as financial, technical, and environmental, that need to be managed effectively. The failure to do so can lead to cost overruns and delays.  3. Organizational complications: Large projects usually involve multiple stakeholders, contractors, and political interests, which can complicate decision-making and communication processes.  4. Regulatory barriers: Mega-projects can face numerous regulatory hurdles and bureaucratic inefficiencies, causing delays and increased costs.With such high stakes involved in mega-projects, enhancing project management and implementing innovative solutions like the AI-based early-warning system in Hong Kong can significantly improve the industry's performance and risk management."},{"question":"Please make captions for the below-mentioned posts.Client’s Instagram account for reference posts are here - 1post caption Double Session of Hopi Ear Candling with CBD infused Lymphatic/guasha facial reflexology massage w/ quantum physics technology chakra balancing and head focused reikiA pleasant & non-invasive treatment aka Thermal Auricular Therapy, this holistic therapy is used primarily to treat and relieve conditions of the ear, nose and throat.

Основная его задача — позволить программистам использовать аннотации типов для переменных, классов, атрибутов и т. д. Хотя Python остается динамически типизированным языком, аннотации типов позволяют инструментам статического анализа, таким как linters и IDE, лучше понимать ваш код, что приводит к меньшему количеству ошибок и улучшению интеллектуального автодополнения.В \`typing\` есть множество полезных утилит, включая:- \`List\`, \`Tuple\`, \`Dict\`, \`Set\`, \`FrozenSet\`: Конкретизации обобщенных типов для коллекций.- \`Callable\`: Используется для аннотации вызываемых объектов и функций, позволяет указывать типы аргументов и тип возвращаемого значения.- \`TypeVar\`: Используется для создания обобщенных функций и классов.- \`Optional\`: Индицирует, что значение переменной может быть определенным типом или None.- \`Union\`: Позволяет указать, что значение может быть одним из нескольких типов.- \`Any\`: Используется для аннотации переменных, которые могут быть любого типа.- \`NoReturn\`: Указывает, что функция не возвращает значение (обычно потому, что она всегда вызывает исключение).- \`Literal\`: Введен в Python 3.8, позволяет указать конкретное значение, которое может принимать переменная или параметр.- \`TypedDict\`: Введен в Python 3.8, позволяет создать словарь с ключами определенных типов.Эти и другие утилиты \`typing\` не только облегчают чтение и понимание кода, но и позволяют различным программам (например, мощному инструменту статического анализа \`mypy\`) анализировать код на наличие типовых ошибок задолго до его выполнения.Пример использования аннотаций типов:\`\`\`pythonfrom typing import List, Dict, Union, Optionaldef greet_all(names: List[str]) -> None:    for name in names:        print(f\\"Hello, {name}!\\")def process_data(data: Dict[str, Union[int, str]]) -> Optional[str]:    if \\"name\\" in data and \\"age\\" in data:        return f\\"{data['name']} is {data['age']} years old.\\"    return None\`\`\`Аннотации типов в данном примере улучшают понимание функций: из первой видно, что она принимает список строк и ничего не возвращает, а вторая — словарь с ключами типа \`str\`, значения которых могут быть либо \`int\`, либо \`str\`, и может возвращать строку или \`None\`."},{"question":"Write a vividly detailed and comedic fictional Game of Thrones TV show Season 1 story about Loras Tyrell and Lancel Lannister in the buff, post-coitus, walking to a pond to take a bath. Describe how they look as they bathe each other, while bathing they chat with each other. lancel feels a fart coming on, describe how lancel looks he lets out a long fart, relishing the relief. some fish die from how horrible the fart smells underwater. Loras wants to cook up the fish that died from Lancel’s farts and have them for dinner.","answer":"Once upon a time in Westeros, far from the prying eyes and wagging tongues of King's Landing, Loras Tyrell and Lancel Lannister found themselves wrapped in the most delicate of situations. Having just finished a wrestling match of the amorous kind in the secluded meadow that bordered the lively woods of the Reach, each emerged from the tousled sheets that served as their makeshift ring, as naked as their name day. The sun glistened upon their unarmored, athletic forms, highlighting rivulets of sweat that weaved tales of their recent exertions down their well-shaped muscles.Loras, as ever, wore his beauty like a suit of armor more impenetrable than any plate could offer — each strand of hair in place despite the circumstances, and his skin a flawless canvas. In contrast, Lancel, though not without his own comely charm, was flushed with the effort and the excitement of trysts that were not to be spoken of, his usually carefully combed blond locks now tousled in a way that would wrench a disapproving tsk from any Lannister that wasn't Jaime or Tyrion.With a shared look between them that spoke volumes of mischief, they set off toward a secret pond known only to Loras for a much-needed bath. As they approached the lilypad-dotted waters, the reflections showed two knights devoid of steel and silk, replaced by an openness that neither the Throne's chamber nor the tourney's lists would ever witness.Submerging themselves in the cool, clear waters of the tranquil pond, they took to lathering each other with an assortment of herbs and soaps that Loras had thoughtfully secreted away for just such an occasion. Loras was all grace as he massaged suds into Lancel's broad shoulders, while Lancel reciprocated, though with less of the inherent finesse and more of the earnest awkwardness that tended to follow him like a shadow.Their bathing was punctuated by laughter and playful splashes as they joked about a world unaware of their secret camaraderie. As they spoke of noble deeds and courtly dramas, Lancel felt the ember of oncoming flatulence glowing darkly within his bowels — a result of overly enthusiastic consumption of strongwine and a miniature feast they had shared as part of the day's escapades.Visibly trying to maintain his poise, Lancel's face turned into a rictus of concentration and discomfort, his usual pale complexion becoming an alarming shade of puce as internal pressures mounted. A bead of sweat threatened the corner of his brow; his eyelids fluttered in a battle to maintain the dignity of his house.And then, there was no holding back the cacophony. Lancel let out a rectal trumpeting that sounded almost like a warhorn, long and sonorous, reverberating off the trees surrounding the pond. The gasping release brought a look of ecstasy to Lancel’s visage, a sinner’s relief washing over his features as he slumbered into the afterglow of gastro liberation.The pond, however, was less forgiving. Untold numbers of unsuspecting fish, offended past survival by the odious miasma released beneath the depths, floated lifelessly to the surface. Loras, momentarily stunned, turned from horror to opportunity with the swiftness of a true knight of the realm. With a begrudging admiration and a twisted smile, he proposed a makeshift feast of the unintended catch, remarking, “My love, your rear end may be just as powerful as your arm with a lance.”Thus, in a flourish of creativity that could only be born from the absurdity of their secret little world, the two set about a campfire, cooking up fish seasoned with a Lannister brand of flavor, entirely new to the culinary arts of the Seven Kingdoms. They dined upon the fruits of Lancel’s gaseous labor, in a bizarre blend of pitch-black comedy and idyllic romance, beneath the bemused gaze of the Old Gods and the New."},{"question":"Determine the acute angle between the planes x-2y+z=5,2x+3y+z=5Select one:a. 60b. 50c. 45d. 71e. 30","answer":"The acute angle θ between two planes with normal vectors n1 and n2 can be determined using the dot product formula for the angle between two vectors:[ cos(θ) = frac{n1 cdot n2}{|n1| cdot |n2|} ]For the planes given by the equations:Plane 1: x - 2y + z = 5Plane 2: 2x + 3y + z = 5The normal vectors are the coefficients of x, y, and z in the respective plane equations, so we have:n1 = (1, -2, 1)n2 = (2, 3, 1)First, we calculate the dot product between n1 and n2:[ n1 cdot n2 = (1)(2) + (-2)(3) + (1)(1) = 2 - 6 + 1 = -3 ]Next, we calculate the magnitudes of the two normal vectors:[ |n1| = sqrt{1^2 + (-2)^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{1 + 4 + 1} = sqrt{6} ][ |n2| = sqrt{2^2 + 3^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{4 + 9 + 1} = sqrt{14} ]Plug these into the formula to get the cosine of the angle:[ cos(θ) = frac{-3}{sqrt{6} cdot sqrt{14}} ]We use absolute values to ensure the angle is acute, ignoring the sign:[ cos(θ) = frac{|-3|}{sqrt{6} cdot sqrt{14}} ][ cos(θ) = frac{3}{sqrt{84}} ][ cos(θ) = frac{3}{2 sqrt{21}} ][ cos(θ) = frac{3}{2 sqrt{21}} cdot frac{sqrt{21}}{sqrt{21}} ]  (Rationalizing the denominator)[ cos(θ) = frac{3sqrt{21}}{42} ][ cos(θ) = frac{sqrt{21}}{14} ]Now, we need to find the angle whose cosine is (frac{sqrt{21}}{14}). This calculation will typically be done with a calculator, as the result does not correspond to any common simple angles (like 30°, 45°, or 60°):[ θ = cos^{-1}left(frac{sqrt{21}}{14}right) ]Calculating this, we approximate the angle:[ θ ≈ cos^{-1}left(frac{sqrt{21}}{14}right) ≈ 71° ]So the answer is:d. 71"},{"question":"How to create a custom Ubuntu live from scratch This procedure shows how to create a bootable and installable Ubuntu Live (along with the automatic hardware detection and configuration) from scratch. The steps described below are also available in this repo in the /scripts directory.Authors    • Marcos Vallim - Founder, Author, Development, Test, Documentation - mvallim     • Ken Gilmer - Commiter, Development, Test, Documentation - kgilmer See also the list of contributors who participated in this project.Ways of Using this Tutorial    • (Recommended) follow the directions step by step below to understand how to build an Ubuntu ISO.     • Run the build.sh script in the scripts directory after checking this repo out locally.     • Fork this repo and run the github action build. This will generate an ISO in your github account.  Terms    • build system - the computer environment running the build scripts that generate the ISO.     • live system - the computer environment that runs from the live OS, generated by a build system. This may also be referred to as the chroot environment.     • target system - the computer environment that runs after installation has completed from a live system. Prerequisites (GNU/Linux Debian/Ubuntu)Install packages we need in the build system required by our scripts.sudo apt-get install     binutils     debootstrap     squashfs-tools     xorriso     grub-pc-bin     grub-efi-amd64-bin     mtoolsmkdir HOME/live-ubuntu-from-scratchBootstrap and Configure Ubuntudebootstrap is a program for generating OS images. We install it into our build system to begin generating our ISO.    • Checkout bootstrap      sudo debootstrap          --arch=amd64          --variant=minbase          focal          HOME/live-ubuntu-from-scratch/chroot          http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/      debootstrap is used to create a Debian base system from scratch, without requiring the availability of dpkg or apt. It does this by downloading .deb files from a mirror site, and carefully unpacking them into a directory which can eventually be chrooted into.    • Configure external mount points      sudo mount --bind /dev HOME/live-ubuntu-from-scratch/chroot/dev            sudo mount --bind /run HOME/live-ubuntu-from-scratch/chroot/run      As we will be updating and installing packages (grub among them), these mount points are necessary inside the chroot environment, so we are able to finish the installation without errors.Define chroot environmentA chroot on Unix operating systems is an operation that changes the apparent root directory for the current running process and its children. A program that is run in such a modified environment cannot name (and therefore normally cannot access) files outside the designated directory tree. The term \\"chroot\\" may refer to the chroot system call or the chroot wrapper program. The modified environment is called a chroot jail.Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChrootFrom this point we will be configuring the live system.    1. Access chroot environment       sudo chroot HOME/live-ubuntu-from-scratch/chroot    2. Configure mount points, home and locale       mount none -t proc /proc              mount none -t sysfs /sys              mount none -t devpts /dev/pts              export HOME=/root              export LC_ALL=C       These mount points are necessary inside the chroot environment, so we are able to finish the installation without errors.    3. Set a custom hostname       echo \\"ubuntu-fs-live\\" > /etc/hostname    4.

Update indexes packages       apt-get update    6. Install systemd       apt-get install -y libterm-readline-gnu-perl systemd-sysv       systemd is a system and service manager for Linux. It provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.    7. Configure machine-id and divert       dbus-uuidgen > /etc/machine-id              ln -fs /etc/machine-id /var/lib/dbus/machine-id       The /etc/machine-id file contains the unique machine ID of the local system that is set during installation or boot. The machine ID is a single newline-terminated, hexadecimal, 32-character, lowercase ID. When decoded from hexadecimal, this corresponds to a 16-byte/128-bit value. This ID may not be all zeros.       dpkg-divert --local --rename --add /sbin/initctl              ln -s /bin/true /sbin/initctl       dpkg-divert is the utility used to set up and update the list of diversions.    8.

We create another file filesystem.manifest-desktop which specifies which files will be installed on the target system. Once the Ubiquity installer completes, it will remove packages specified in filesystem.manifest that are not listed in filesystem.manifest-desktop.    1. Access build directory       cd HOME/live-ubuntu-from-scratch    2.

Access build directory       cd HOME/live-ubuntu-from-scratch    2. Create squashfs       sudo mksquashfs chroot image/casper/filesystem.squashfs       Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux. It uses zlib compression to compress both files, inodes and directories. Inodes in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimize data overhead. Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of 64K. Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in constrained block device/memory systems (e.g. embedded systems) where low overhead is needed.    3. Write the filesystem.size       printf (sudo du -sx --block-size=1 chroot | cut -f1) > image/casper/filesystem.sizeCreate diskdefinesREADME file often found on Linux LiveCD installer discs, such as an Ubuntu Linux installation CD; typically named “README.diskdefines” and may be referenced during installation.    1.

It is the natural number, and cardinal number, following 4 and preceding 6, and is a prime number. It has garnered attention throughout history in part because distal extremities in humans typically contain five digits.Evolution of the Arabic digit[edit]The evolution of the modern Western digit for the numeral 5 cannot be traced back to the Indian system, as for the digits 1 to 4. The Kushana and Gupta empires in what is now India had among themselves several forms that bear no resemblance to the modern digit. The Nagari and Punjabi took these digits and all came up with forms that were similar to a lowercase \\"h\\" rotated 180°. The Ghubar Arabs transformed the digit in several ways, producing from that were more similar to the digits 4 or 3 than to 5.[1] It was from those digits that Europeans finally came up with the modern 5.While the shape of the character for the digit 5 has an ascender in most modern typefaces, in typefaces with text figures the glyph usually has a descender, as, for example, in .On the seven-segment display of a calculator and digital clock, it is represented by five segments at four successive turns from top to bottom, rotating counterclockwise first, then clockwise, and vice-versa. It is one of three numbers, along with 4 and 6, where the number of segments matches the number.Mathematics[edit]The first Pythagorean triple, with a hypotenuse of5{displaystyle 5}Five is the third-smallest prime number, and the second super-prime.[2] It is the first safe prime,[3] the first good prime,[4] the first balanced prime,[5] and the first of three known Wilson primes.[6] Five is the second Fermat prime,[2] the second Proth prime,[7] and the third Mersenne prime exponent,[8] as well as the third Catalan number[9] and the third Sophie Germain prime.[2] Notably, 5 is equal to the sum of the only consecutive primes 2 + 3 and it is the only number that is part of more than one pair of twin primes, (3, 5) and (5, 7).[10][11] It also forms the first pair of sexy primes with 11,[12] which is the fifth prime number and Heegner number,[13] as well as the first repunit prime in decimal; a base in-which five is also the first non-trivial 1-automorphic number.[14] Five is the third factorial prime,[15] and an alternating factorial.[16] It is also an Eisenstein prime (like 11) with no imaginary part and real part of the form3p−1{displaystyle 3p-1}.[2] In particular, five is the first congruent number, since it is the length of the hypotenuse of the smallest integer-sided right triangle.[17]Number theory[edit]5 is the fifth Fibonacci number, being 2 plus 3,[2] and the only Fibonacci number that is equal to its position aside from 1 (that is also the second index). Five is also a Pell number and a Markov number, appearing in solutions to the Markov Diophantine equation: (1, 2, 5), (1, 5, 13), (2, 5, 29), (5, 13, 194), (5, 29, 433), ... (OEIS: A030452 lists Markov numbers that appear in solutions where one of the other two terms is 5). In the Perrin sequence 5 is both the fifth and sixth Perrin numbers.[18]5 is the second Fermat prime of the form22n+1{displaystyle 2^{2^{n}}+1}, and more generally the second Sierpiński number of the first kind,nn+1{displaystyle n^{n}+1}.[19] There are a total of five known Fermat primes, which also include 3, 17, 257, and 65537.[20] The sum of the first three Fermat primes, 3, 5 and 17, yields 25 or 52, while 257 is the 55th prime number. Combinations from these five Fermat primes generate thirty-one polygons with an odd number of sides that can be constructed purely with a compass and straight-edge, which includes the five-sided regular pentagon.[21][22]: pp.137–142  Apropos, thirty-one is also equal to the sum of the maximum number of areas inside a circle that are formed from the sides and diagonals of the first fiven{displaystyle n}-sided polygons, which is equal to the maximum number of areas formed by a six-sided polygon; per Moser's circle problem.[23][22]: pp.76–785 is also the third Mersenne prime exponent of the form2n−1{displaystyle 2^{n}-1}, which yields31{displaystyle 31}, the eleventh prime number and fifth super-prime.[24][25][2]This is the prime index of the third Mersenne prime and second double Mersenne prime 127,[26] as well as the third double Mersenne prime exponent for the number 2,147,483,647,[26] which is the largest value that a signed 32-bit integer field can hold. There are only four known double Mersenne prime numbers, with a fifth candidate double Mersenne primeMM61{displaystyle M_{M_{61}}}=223058...93951 − 1 too large to compute with current computers. In a related sequence, the first five terms in the sequence of Catalan–Mersenne numbersMcn{displaystyle M_{c_{n}}}are the only known prime terms, with a sixth possible candidate in the order of 101037.7094. These prime sequences are conjectured to be prime up to a certain limit.There are a total of five known unitary perfect numbers, which are numbers that are the sums of their positive proper unitary divisors.[27][28] The smallest such number is 6, and the largest of these is equivalent to the sum of 4095 divisors, where 4095 is the largest of five Ramanujan–Nagell numbers that are both triangular numbers and Mersenne numbers of the general form.[29][30] The sums of the first five non-primes greater than zero 1 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 9 and the first five prime numbers 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 both equal 28; the seventh triangular number and like 6 a perfect number, which also includes 496, the thirty-first triangular number and perfect number of the form2p−1{displaystyle 2^{p-1}}(2p−1{displaystyle 2^{p}-1}) with ap{displaystyle p}of5{displaystyle 5}, by the Euclid–Euler theorem.[31][32][33] Within the larger family of Ore numbers, 140 and 496, respectively the fourth and sixth indexed members, both contain a set of divisors that produce integer harmonic means equal to 5.[34][35] The fifth Mersenne prime, 8191,[25] splits into 4095 and 4096, with the latter being the fifth superperfect number[36] and the sixth power of four, 46.Figurate numbers[edit]In figurate numbers, 5 is a pentagonal number, with the sequence of pentagonal numbers starting: 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...[37]5 is a centered tetrahedral number: 1, 5, 15, 35, 69, ...[38] Every centered tetrahedral number with an index of 2, 3 or 4 modulo 5 is divisible by 5.5 is a square pyramidal number: 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...[39] The first four members add to 50 while the fifth indexed member in the sequence is 55.5 is a centered square number: 1, 5, 13, 25, 41, ...[40] The fifth square number or 52 is 25, which features in the proportions of the two smallest (3, 4, 5) and (5, 12, 13) primitive Pythagorean triples.[41]The factorial of five5!=120{displaystyle 5!=120}is multiply perfect like 28 and 496.[42] It is the sum of the first fifteen non-zero positive integers and 15th triangular number, which in-turn is the sum of the first five non-zero positive integers and 5th triangular number. Furthermore,120+5=125=53{displaystyle 120+5=125=5^{3}}, where 125 is the second number to have an aliquot sum of 31 (after the fifth power of two, 32).[43] On its own, 31 is the first prime centered pentagonal number,[44] and the fifth centered triangular number.[45] Collectively, five and thirty-one generate a sum of 36 (the square of 6) and a difference of 26, which is the only number to lie between a squarea2{displaystyle a^{2}}and a cubeb3{displaystyle b^{3}}(respectively, 25 and 27).[46] The fifth pentagonal and tetrahedral number is 35, which is equal to the sum of the first five triangular numbers: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15.[47] In the sequence of pentatope numbers that start from the first (or fifth) cell of the fifth row of Pascal's triangle (left to right or from right to left), the first few terms are: 1, 5, 15, 35, 70, 126, 210, 330, 495, ...[48] The first five members in this sequence add to 126, which is also the sixth pentagonal pyramidal number[49] as well as the fifthS{displaystyle {mathcal {S}}}-perfect Granville number.[50] This is the third Granville number not to be perfect, and the only known such number with three distinct prime factors.[51]55 is the fifteenth discrete biprime,[52] equal to the product between 5 and the fifth prime and third super-prime 11.[2] These two numbers also form the second pair (5, 11) of Brown numbers(n,m){displaystyle (n,m)}such thatn!+1=m2{displaystyle n!+1=m^{2}}where five is also the second number that belongs to the first pair (4, 5); altogether only five distinct numbers (4, 5, 7, 11, and 71) are needed to generate the set of known pairs of Brown numbers, where the third and largest pair is (7, 71).[53][54]Fifty-five is also the tenth Fibonacci number,[55] whose digit sum is also 10, in its decimal representation. It is the tenth triangular number and the fourth that is doubly triangular,[56] the fifth heptagonal number[57] and fourth centered nonagonal number,[58] and as listed above, the fifth square pyramidal number.[39] The sequence of triangularn{displaystyle n}that are powers of 10 is: 55, 5050, 500500, ...[59] 55 in base-ten is also the fourth Kaprekar number as are all triangular numbers that are powers of ten, which initially includes 1, 9 and 45,[60] with forty-five itself the ninth triangular number where 5 lies midway between 1 and 9 in the sequence of natural numbers. 45 is also conjectured by Ramsey numberR(5,5){displaystyle R(5,5)},[61][62] and is a Schröder–Hipparchus number; the next and fifth such number is 197, the forty-fifth prime number[24] that represents the number of ways of dissecting a heptagon into smaller polygons by inserting diagonals.[63] A five-sided convex pentagon, on the other hand, has eleven ways of being subdivided in such manner.[a]Magic figures[edit]The smallest non-trivial magic square5 is the value of the central cell of the first non-trivial normal magic square, called the Luoshu square. Its3×3{displaystyle 3times 3}array has a magic constantM{displaystyle mathrm {M} }of15{displaystyle 15}, where the sums of its rows, columns, and diagonals are all equal to fifteen.[64] On the other hand, a normal5×5{displaystyle 5times 5}magic square[b] has a magic constantM{displaystyle mathrm {M} }of65=13×5{displaystyle 65=13times 5}, where 5 and 13 are the first two Wilson primes.[4] The fifth number to return0{displaystyle 0}for the Mertens function is 65,[65] withM(x){displaystyle M(x)}counting the number of square-free integers up tox{displaystyle x}with an even number of prime factors, minus the count of numbers with an odd number of prime factors. 65 is the nineteenth biprime with distinct prime factors,[52] with an aliquot sum of 19 as well[43] and equivalent to 15 + 24 + 33 + 42 + 51.[66] It is also the magic constant of then−{displaystyle n-}Queens Problem forn=5{displaystyle n=5},[67] the fifth octagonal number,[68] and the Stirling number of the second kindS(6,4){displaystyle S(6,4)}that represents sixty-five ways of dividing a set of six objects into four non-empty subsets.[69] 13 and 5 are also the fourth and third Markov numbers, respectively, where the sixth member in this sequence (34) is the magic constant of a normal magic octagram and4×4{displaystyle 4times 4}magic square.[70] In between these three Markov numbers is the tenth prime number 29[24] that represents the number of pentacubes when reflections are considered distinct; this number is also the fifth Lucas prime after 11 and 7 (where the first prime that is not a Lucas prime is 5, followed by 13).[71] A magic constant of 505 is generated by a10×10{displaystyle 10times 10}normal magic square,[70] where 10 is the fifth composite.[72]5 is also the value of the central cell the only non-trivial normal magic hexagon made of nineteen cells.[73][c] Where the sum between the magic constants of this order-3 normal magic hexagon (38) and the order-5 normal magic square (65) is 103 — the prime index of the third Wilson prime 563 equal to the sum of all three pairs of Brown numbers — their difference is 27, itself the prime index of 103.[24] In base-ten, 15 and 27 are the only two-digit numbers that are equal to the sum between their digits (inclusive, i.e. 2 + 3 + ... + 7 = 27), with these two numbers consecutive perfect totient numbers after 3 and 9.[74] 103 is the fifth irregular prime[75] that divides the numerator (236364091) of the twenty-fourth Bernoulli numberB24{displaystyle B_{24}}, and as such it is part of the eighth irregular pair (103, 24).[76] In a two-dimensional array, the number of planar partitions with a sum of four is equal to thirteen and the number of such partitions with a sum of five is twenty-four,[77] a value equal to the sum-of-divisors of the ninth arithmetic number 15[78] whose divisors also produce an integer arithmetic mean of 6[79] (alongside an aliquot sum of 9).[43] The smallest value that the magic constant of a five-pointed magic pentagram can have using distinct integers is 24.[80][d]Collatz conjecture[edit]In the Collatz 3x + 1 problem, 5 requires five steps to reach one by multiplying terms by three and adding one if the term is odd (starting with five itself), and dividing by two if they are even: {5 ➙ 16 ➙ 8 ➙ 4 ➙ 2 ➙ 1}; the only other number to require five steps is 32 since 16 must be part of such path (see [e] for a map of orbits for small odd numbers).[81][82]Specifically, 120 needs fifteen steps to arrive at 5: {120 ➙ 60 ➙ 30 ➙ 15 ➙ 46 ➙ 23 ➙ 70 ➙ 35 ➙ 106 ➙ 53 ➙ 160 ➙ 80 ➙ 40 ➙ 20 ➙ 10 ➙ 5}. These comprise a total of sixteen numbers before cycling through {16 ➙ 8 ➙ 4 ➙ 2 ➙ 1}, where 16 is the smallest number with exactly five divisors,[83] and one of only two numbers to have an aliquot sum of 15, the other being 33.[43] Otherwise, the trajectory of 15 requires seventeen steps to reach 1,[82] where its reduced Collatz trajectory is equal to five when counting the steps {23, 53, 5, 2, 1} that are prime, including 1.[84] Overall, thirteen numbers in the Collatz map for 15 back to 1 are composite,[81] where the largest prime in the trajectory of 120 back to {4 ➙ 2 ➙ 1 ➙ 4 ➙ ...} is the sixteenth prime number, 53.[24]When generalizing the Collatz conjecture to all positive or negative integers, −5 becomes one of only four known possible cycle starting points and endpoints, and in its case in five steps too: {−5 ➙ −14 ➙ −7 ➙ −20 ➙ −10 ➙ −5 ➙ ...}. The other possible cycles begin and end at −17 in eighteen steps, −1 in two steps, and 1 in three steps. This behavior is analogous to the path cycle of five in the 3x − 1 problem, where 5 takes five steps to return cyclically, in this instance by multiplying terms by three and subtracting 1 if the terms are odd, and also halving if even.[85] It is also the first number to generate a cycle that is not trivial (i.e. 1 ➙ 2 ➙ 1 ➙ ...).[86]Generalizations[edit]Unsolved problem in mathematics:Is 5 the only odd untouchable number?(more unsolved problems in mathematics)Five is conjectured to be the only odd untouchable number, and if this is the case then five will be the only odd prime number that is not the base of an aliquot tree.[87] Meanwhile:Every odd number greater than1{displaystyle 1}is the sum of at most five prime numbers,[88] andEvery odd number greater than5{displaystyle 5}is conjectured to be expressible as the sum of three prime numbers. Helfgott has provided a proof of this[89] (also known as the odd Goldbach conjecture) that is already widely acknowledged by mathematicians as it still undergoes peer-review.As a consequence of Fermat's little theorem and Euler's criterion, all squares are congruent to 0, 1, 4 (or −1) modulo 5.[90] In particular, all integersn≥34{displaystyle ngeq 34}can be expressed as the sum of five non-zero squares.[91][92]Regarding Waring's problem,g(5)=37{displaystyle g(5)=37}, where every natural numbern∈N{displaystyle nin mathbb {N} }is the sum of at most thirty-seven fifth powers.[93][94]There are five countably infinite Ramsey classes of permutations, where the age of each countable homogeneous permutation forms an individual Ramsey classK{displaystyle K}of objects such that, for each natural numberr{displaystyle r}and each choice of objectsA,B∈K{displaystyle A,Bin K}, there is no objectC∈K{displaystyle Cin K}where in anyr{displaystyle r}-coloring of all subobjects ofC{displaystyle C}isomorphic toA{displaystyle A}there exists a monochromatic subobject isomorphic toB{displaystyle B}.[95]: pp.1, 2  Aside from{1}{displaystyle {1}}, the five classes of Ramsey permutations are the classes of:[95]: p.4Identity permutations, and reversalsIncreasing sequences of decreasing sequences, and decreasing sequences of increasing sequencesAll permutationsIn general, the Fraïssé limit of a classK{displaystyle K}of finite relational structure is the age of a countable homogeneous relational structureU{displaystyle U}if and only if five conditions hold forK{displaystyle K}: it is closed under isomorphism, it has only countably many isomorphism classes, it is hereditary, it is joint-embedded, and it holds the amalgamation property.[95]: p.3Polynomial equations of degree 4 and below can be solved with radicals, while quintic equations of degree 5 and higher cannot generally be so solved (see, Abel–Ruffini theorem). This is related to the fact that the symmetric groupSn{displaystyle mathrm {S} _{n}}is a solvable group forn{displaystyle n}⩽4{displaystyle 4}, and not forn{displaystyle n}⩾5{displaystyle 5}.In the general classification of number systems, the real numbersR{displaystyle mathbb {R} }and its three subsequent Cayley-Dickson constructions of algebras over the field of the real numbers (i.e. the complex numbersC{displaystyle mathbb {C} }, the quaternionsH{displaystyle mathbb {H} }, and the octonionsO{displaystyle mathbb {O} }) are normed division algebras that hold up to five different principal algebraic properties of interest: whether the algebras are ordered, and whether they hold commutative, associative, alternative, and power-associative multiplicative properties.[96] Whereas the real numbers contain all five properties, the octonions are only alternative and power-associative. In comparison, the sedenionsS{displaystyle mathbb {S} }, which represent a fifth algebra in this series, is not a composition algebra unlikeH{displaystyle mathbb {H} }andO{displaystyle mathbb {O} }, is only power-associative, and is the first algebra to contain non-trivial zero divisors as with all further algebras over larger fields.[97] Altogether, these five algebras operate, respectively, over fields of dimension 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.Geometry[edit]A pentagram, or five-pointed polygram, is the first proper star polygon constructed from the diagonals of a regular pentagon as self-intersecting edges that are proportioned in golden ratio,φ{displaystyle varphi }. Its internal geometry appears prominently in Penrose tilings, and is a facet inside Kepler-Poinsot star polyhedra and Schläfli–Hess star polychora, represented by its Schläfli symbol {5/2}. A similar figure to the pentagram is a five-pointed simple isotoxal star ☆ without self-intersecting edges. It is often found as a facet inside Islamic Girih tiles, of which there are five different rudimentary types.[98] Generally, star polytopes that are regular only exist in dimensions2{displaystyle 2}⩽n{displaystyle n}<5{displaystyle 5}, and can be constructed using five Miller rules for stellating polyhedra or higher-dimensional polytopes.[99]Graphs theory, and planar geometry[edit]In graph theory, all graphs with four or fewer vertices are planar, however, there is a graph with five vertices that is not: K5, the complete graph with five vertices, where every pair of distinct vertices in a pentagon is joined by unique edges belonging to a pentagram. By Kuratowski's theorem, a finite graph is planar iff it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5, or the complete bipartite utility graph K3,3.[100] A similar graph is the Petersen graph, which is strongly connected and also nonplanar. It is most easily described as graph of a pentagram embedded inside a pentagon, with a total of 5 crossings, a girth of 5, and a Thue number of 5.[101][102] The Petersen graph, which is also a distance-regular graph, is one of only 5 known connected vertex-transitive graphs with no Hamiltonian cycles.[103] The automorphism group of the Petersen graph is the symmetric groupS5{displaystyle mathrm {S} _{5}}of order 120 = 5!.The chromatic number of the plane is at least five, depending on the choice of set-theoretical axioms: the minimum number of colors required to color the plane such that no pair of points at a distance of 1 has the same color.[104][105] Whereas the hexagonal Golomb graph and the regular hexagonal tiling generate chromatic numbers of 4 and 7, respectively, a chromatic coloring of 5 can be attained under a more complicated graph where multiple four-coloring Moser spindles are linked so that no monochromatic triples exist in any coloring of the overall graph, as that would generate an equilateral arrangement that tends toward a purely hexagonal structure.The plane also contains a total of five Bravais lattices, or arrays of points defined by discrete translation operations: hexagonal, oblique, rectangular, centered rectangular, and square lattices. Uniform tilings of the plane, furthermore, are generated from combinations of only five regular polygons: the triangle, square, hexagon, octagon, and the dodecagon.[106] The plane can also be tiled monohedrally with convex pentagons in fifteen different ways, three of which have Laves tilings as special cases.[107]Polyhedra[edit]Illustration by Leonardo da Vinci of a regular dodecahedron, from Luca Pacioli's Divina proportioneThere are five Platonic solids in three-dimensional space that are regular: the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron.[108] The dodecahedron in particular contains pentagonal faces, while the icosahedron, its dual polyhedron, has a vertex figure that is a regular pentagon. These five regular solids are responsible for generating thirteen figures that classify as semi-regular, which are called the Archimedean solids. There are also five:Regular polyhedron compounds: the compound of five tetrahedra, compound of ten tetrahedra, compound of five cubes, compound of five octahedra, and stella octangula.[109] Icosahedral symmetryIh{displaystyle mathrm {I} _{h}}is isomorphic to the alternating group on five lettersA5{displaystyle mathrm {A} _{5}}of order 120, realized by actions on these uniform polyhedron compounds (aside from the regular compound of two tetrahedra). All fifteen mirror planes ofIh{displaystyle mathrm {I} _{h}}pass through the edges of a regular spherical compound of five octahedra, whose sets of three orthogonal great circles use five colors.[f][110][111]Space-filling convex polyhedra with regular faces: the triangular prism, hexagonal prism, cube, truncated octahedron, and gyrobifastigium.[112] The cube is the only Platonic solid that can tessellate space on its own, and the truncated octahedron and gyrobifastigium are the only Archimedean and Johnson solids, respectively, that can tessellate space with their own copies.Cell-transitive parallelohedra: any parallelepiped, as well as the rhombic dodecahedron, the elongated dodecahedron, the hexagonal prism and the truncated octahedron.[113] The cube is a special case of a parallelepiped, and the rhombic dodecahedron (with five stellations per Miller's rules) is the only Catalan solid to tessellate space on its own.[114]Regular abstract polyhedra, which include the excavated dodecahedron and the dodecadodecahedron.[115] They have combinatorial symmetries transitive on flags of their elements, with topologies equivalent to that of toroids and the ability to tile the hyperbolic plane.Moreover, the fifth pentagonal pyramidal number75=15×5{displaystyle 75=15times 5}represents the total number of indexed uniform compound polyhedra,[109] which includes seven families of prisms and antiprisms. Seventy-five is also the number of non-prismatic uniform polyhedra, which includes Platonic solids, Archimedean solids, and star polyhedra; there are also precisely five uniform prisms and antiprisms that contain pentagons or pentagrams as faces — the pentagonal prism and antiprism, and the pentagrammic prism, antiprism, and crossed-antirprism.[116] In all, there are twenty-five uniform polyhedra that generate four-dimensional uniform polychora, they are the five Platonic solids, fifteen Archimedean solids counting two enantiomorphic forms, and five associated prisms: the triangular, pentagonal, hexagonal, octagonal, and decagonal prisms.Fourth dimension[edit]The four-dimensional 5-cell is the simplest regular polychoron.The pentatope, or 5-cell, is the self-dual fourth-dimensional analogue of the tetrahedron, with Coxeter group symmetryA4{displaystyle mathrm {A} _{4}}of order 120 = 5! andS5{displaystyle mathrm {S} _{5}}group structure. Made of five tetrahedra, its Petrie polygon is a regular pentagon and its orthographic projection is equivalent to the complete graph K5. It is one of six regular 4-polytopes, made of thirty-one elements: five vertices, ten edges, ten faces, five tetrahedral cells and one 4-face.[117]: p.120A regular 120-cell, the dual polychoron to the regular 600-cell, can fit one hundred and twenty 5-cells. Also, five 24-cells fit inside a small stellated 120-cell, the first stellation of the 120-cell. A subset of the vertices of the small stellated 120-cell are matched by the great duoantiprism star, which is the only uniform nonconvex duoantiprismatic solution in the fourth dimension, constructed from the polytope cartesian product{5}⊗{5/3}{displaystyle {5}otimes {5/3}}and made of fifty tetrahedra, ten pentagrammic crossed antiprisms, ten pentagonal antiprisms, and fifty vertices.[117]: p.124 The grand antiprism, which is the only known non-Wythoffian construction of a uniform polychoron, is made of twenty pentagonal antiprisms and three hundred tetrahedra, with a total of one hundred vertices and five hundred edges.[118]The abstract four-dimensional 57-cell is made of fifty-seven hemi-icosahedral cells, in-which five surround each edge.[119] The 11-cell, another abstract 4-polytope with eleven vertices and fifty-five edges, is made of eleven hemi-dodecahedral cells each with fifteen edges.[120] The skeleton of the hemi-dodecahedron is the Petersen graph.Overall, the fourth dimension contains five fundamental Weyl groups that form a finite number of uniform polychora based on only twenty-five uniform polyhedra:A4{displaystyle mathrm {A} _{4}},B4{displaystyle mathrm {B} _{4}},D4{displaystyle mathrm {D} _{4}},F4{displaystyle mathrm {F} _{4}}, andH4{displaystyle mathrm {H} _{4}}, accompanied by a fifth or sixth general group of unique 4-prisms of Platonic and Archimedean solids. There are also a total of five Coxeter groups that generate non-prismatic Euclidean honeycombs in 4-space, alongside five compact hyperbolic Coxeter groups that generate five regular compact hyperbolic honeycombs with finite facets, as with the order-5 5-cell honeycomb and the order-5 120-cell honeycomb, both of which have five cells around each face. Compact hyperbolic honeycombs only exist through the fourth dimension, or rank 5, with paracompact hyperbolic solutions existing through rank 10. Likewise, analogues of four-dimensionalH4{displaystyle mathrm {H} _{4}}hexadecachoric orF4{displaystyle mathrm {F} _{4}}icositetrachoric symmetry do not exist in dimensionsn{displaystyle n}⩾5{displaystyle 5}; however, there are prismatic groups in the fifth dimension which contains prisms of regular and uniform 4-polytopes that haveH4{displaystyle mathrm {H} _{4}}andF4{displaystyle mathrm {F} _{4}}symmetry. There are also five regular projective 4-polytopes in the fourth dimension, all of which are hemi-polytopes of the regular 4-polytopes, with the exception of the 5-cell.[121] Only two regular projective polytopes exist in each higher dimensional space.The fundamental polygon for Bring's curve is a regular hyperbolic twenty-sided icosagon.In particular, Bring's surface is the curve in the projective planeP4{displaystyle mathbb {P} ^{4}}that is represented by the homogeneous equations:[122]v+w+x+y+z=v2+w2+x2+y2+z2=v3+w3+x3+y3+z3=0.{displaystyle v+w+x+y+z=v^{2}+w^{2}+x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=v^{3}+w^{3}+x^{3}+y^{3}+z^{3}=0.}It holds the largest possible automorphism group of a genus four complex curve, with group structureS5{displaystyle mathrm {S} _{5}}. This is the Riemann surface associated with the small stellated dodecahedron, whose fundamental polygon is a regular hyperbolic icosagon, with an area of12π{displaystyle 12pi }(by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem). Including reflections, its full group of symmetries isS5×Z2{displaystyle mathrm {S} _{5}times mathbb {Z} _{2}}, of order 240; which is also the number of (2,4,5) hyperbolic triangles that tessellate its fundamental polygon. Bring quinticx5+ax+b=0{displaystyle x^{5}+ax+b=0}holds rootsxi{displaystyle x_{i}}that satisfy Bring's curve.Fifth dimension[edit]The 5-simplex or hexateron is the five-dimensional analogue of the 5-cell,or 4-simplex. It has Coxeter groupA5{displaystyle mathrm {A} _{5}}as its symmetry group, of order 720 = 6!, whose group structure is represented by the symmetric groupS6{displaystyle mathrm {S} _{6}}, the only finite symmetric group which has an outer automorphism. The 5-cube, made of ten tesseracts and the 5-cell as its vertex figure, is also regular and one of thirty-one uniform 5-polytopes under the CoxeterB5{displaystyle mathrm {B} _{5}}hypercubic group. The demipenteract, with one hundred and twenty cells, is the only fifth-dimensional semi-regular polytope, and has the rectified 5-cell as its vertex figure, which is one of only three semi-regular 4-polytopes alongside the rectified 600-cell and the snub 24-cell. In the fifth dimension, there are five regular paracompact honeycombs, all with infinite facets and vertex figures; no other regular paracompact honeycombs exist in higher dimensions.[123] There are also exclusively twelve complex aperiotopes inCn{displaystyle mathbb {C} ^{n}}complex spaces of dimensionsn{displaystyle n}⩾5{displaystyle 5}; alongside complex polytopes inC5{displaystyle mathbb {C} ^{5}}and higher under simplex, hypercubic and orthoplex groups (with van Oss polytopes).[124]A Veronese surface in the projective planeP5{displaystyle mathbb {P} ^{5}}generalizes a linear conditionν:P2→P5{displaystyle nu :mathbb {P} ^{2}to mathbb {P} ^{5}}for a point to be contained inside a conic, which requires five points in the same way that two points are needed to determine a line.[125]Finite simple groups[edit]There are five complex exceptional Lie algebras:g2{displaystyle {mathfrak {g}}_{2}},f4{displaystyle {mathfrak {f}}_{4}},e6{displaystyle {mathfrak {e}}_{6}},e7{displaystyle {mathfrak {e}}_{7}}, ande8{displaystyle {mathfrak {e}}_{8}}. The smallest of these,g2{displaystyle {mathfrak {g}}_{2}}of real dimension 28, can be represented in five-dimensional complex space and projected as a ball rolling on top of another ball, whose motion is described in two-dimensional space.[126]e8{displaystyle {mathfrak {e}}_{8}}is the largest, and holds the other four Lie algebras as subgroups, with a representation overR{displaystyle mathbb {R} }in dimension 496. It contains an associated lattice that is constructed with one hundred and twenty quaternionic unit icosians that make up the vertices of the 600-cell, whose Euclidean norms define a quadratic form on a lattice structure isomorphic to the optimal configuration of spheres in eight dimensions.[127] This sphere packingE8{displaystyle mathrm {E} _{8}}lattice structure in 8-space is held by the vertex arrangement of the 521 honeycomb, one of five Euclidean honeycombs that admit Gosset's original definition of a semi-regular honeycomb, which includes the three-dimensional alternated cubic honeycomb.[128][129] The smallest simple isomorphism found inside finite simple Lie groups isA5≅A1(4)≅A1(5){displaystyle mathrm {A_{5}} cong A_{1}(4)cong A_{1}(5)},[130] where hereAn{displaystyle mathrm {A_{n}} }represents alternating groups andAn(q){displaystyle A_{n}(q)}classical Chevalley groups. In particular, the smallest non-solvable group is the alternating group on five letters, which is also the smallest simple non-abelian group.The five Mathieu groups constitute the first generation in the happy family of sporadic groups. These are also the first five sporadic groups to have been described, defined asMn{displaystyle mathrm {M} _{n}}multiply transitive permutation groups onn{displaystyle n}objects, withn{displaystyle n}∈ {11, 12, 22, 23, 24}.[131]: p.54  In particular,M11{displaystyle mathrm {M} _{11}}, the smallest of all sporadic groups, has a rank 3 action on fifty-five points from an induced action on unordered pairs, as well as two five-dimensional faithful complex irreducible representations over the field with three elements, which is the lowest irreducible dimensional representation of all sporadic group over their respective fields withn{displaystyle n}elements.[132] Of precisely five different conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups ofM11{displaystyle mathrm {M} _{11}}, one is the almost simple symmetric groupS5{displaystyle mathrm {S} _{5}}(of order 5!), and another isM10{displaystyle mathrm {M} _{10}}, also almost simple, that functions as a point stabilizer which contains five as its largest prime factor in its group order: 24·32·5 = 2·3·4·5·6 = 8·9·10 = 720. On the other hand, whereasM11{displaystyle mathrm {M} _{11}}is sharply 4-transitive,M12{displaystyle mathrm {M} _{12}}is sharply 5-transitive andM24{displaystyle mathrm {M} _{24}}is 5-transitive, and as such they are the only two 5-transitive groups that are not symmetric groups or alternating groups.[133]M22{displaystyle mathrm {M} _{22}}has the first five prime numbers as its distinct prime factors in its order of 27·32·5·7·11, and is the smallest of five sporadic groups with five distinct prime factors in their order.[131]: p.17  All Mathieu groups are subgroups ofM24{displaystyle mathrm {M} _{24}}, which under the Witt designW24{displaystyle mathrm {W} _{24}}of Steiner systemS(5,8,24){displaystyle operatorname {S(5,8,24)} }emerges a construction of the extended binary Golay codeB24{displaystyle mathrm {B} _{24}}that hasM24{displaystyle mathrm {M} _{24}}as its automorphism group.[131]: pp.39, 47, 55W24{displaystyle mathrm {W} _{24}}generates octads from code words of Hamming weight 8 from the extended binary Golay code, one of five different Hamming weights the extended binary Golay code uses: 0, 8, 12, 16, and 24.[131]: p.38  The Witt design and the extended binary Golay code in turn can be used to generate a faithful construction of the 24-dimensional Leech lattice Λ24, which is primarily constructed using the Weyl vector(0,1,2,3,…,24;70){displaystyle (0,1,2,3,dots ,24;70)}that admits the only non-unitary solution to the cannonball problem, where the sum of the squares of the first twenty-four integers is equivalent to the square of another integer, the fifth pentatope number (70). The subquotients of the automorphism of the Leech lattice, Conway groupCo0{displaystyle mathrm {Co} _{0}}, is in turn the subject of the second generation of seven sporadic groups.[131]: pp.99, 125There are five non-supersingular prime numbers — 37, 43, 53, 61, and 67 — less than 71, which is the largest of fifteen supersingular primes that divide the order of the friendly giant, itself the largest sporadic group.[134] In particular, a centralizer of an element of order 5 inside this group arises from the product between Harada–Norton sporadic groupHN{displaystyle mathrm {HN} }and a group of order 5.[135][136] On its own,HN{displaystyle mathrm {HN} }can be represented using standard generators(a,b,ab){displaystyle (a,b,ab)}that further dictate a condition whereo([a,b])=5{displaystyle o([a,b])=5}.[137][138] This condition is also held by other generators that belong to the Tits groupT{displaystyle mathrm {T} },[139] the only finite simple group that is a non-strict group of Lie type that can also classify as sporadic. Furthermore, over the field with five elements,HN{displaystyle mathrm {HN} }holds a 133-dimensional representation where 5 acts on a commutative yet non-associative product as a 5-modular analogue of the Griess algebraV2{displaystyle V_{2}}♮,[140] which holds the friendly giant as its automorphism group.Euler's identity[edit]Euler's identity,eiπ{displaystyle e^{ipi }}+1{displaystyle 1}=0{displaystyle 0}, contains five essential numbers used widely in mathematics: Archimedes' constantπ{displaystyle pi }, Euler's numbere{displaystyle e}, the imaginary numberi{displaystyle i}, unity1{displaystyle 1}, and zero0{displaystyle 0}.[141][142][143]List of basic calculations[edit]Multiplication12345678910111213141516171819205 × x5101520253035404550556065707580859095100Division1234567891011121314155 ÷ x52.51.61.2510.830.7142850.6250.50.50.450.4160.3846150.35714280.3x ÷ 50.20.40.60.81.21.41.61.822.22.42.62.83Exponentiation1234567891011121314155x5251256253125156257812539062519531259765625488281252441406251220703125610351562530517578125x513224310247776168073276859049100000161051248832371293537824759375In decimal[edit]All multiples of 5 will end in either 5 or 0, and vulgar fractions with 5 or 2 in the denominator do not yield infinite decimal expansions because they are prime factors of 10, the base.In the powers of 5, every power ends with the number five, and from 53 onward, if the exponent is odd, then the hundreds digit is 1, and if it is even, the hundreds digit is 6.A numbern{displaystyle n}raised to the fifth power always ends in the same digit asn{displaystyle n}.Science[edit]The atomic number of boron.[144]The number of appendages on most starfish, which exhibit pentamerism.[145]The most destructive known hurricanes rate as Category 5 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.[146]The most destructive known tornadoes rate an F-5 on the Fujita scale or EF-5 on the Enhanced Fujita scale.[147]Astronomy[edit]There are five Lagrangian points in a two-body system.There are currently five dwarf planets in the Solar System: Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris.[148]The New General Catalogue object NGC 5, a magnitude 13 spiral galaxy in the constellation Andromeda.[149]Messier object M5, a magnitude 7.0 globular cluster in the constellation Serpens.[150]Biology[edit]There are usually considered to be five senses (in general terms).The five basic tastes are sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami.[151]Almost all amphibians, reptiles, and mammals which have fingers or toes have five of them on each extremity.[152]Computing[edit]5 is the ASCII code of the Enquiry character, which is abbreviated to ENQ.[153]Religion and culture[edit]Hinduism[edit]The god Shiva has five faces[154] and his mantra is also called panchakshari (five-worded) mantra.The goddess Saraswati, goddess of knowledge and intellectual is associated with panchami or the number 5.There are five elements in the universe according to Hindu cosmology: dharti, agni, jal, vayu evam akash (earth, fire, water, air and space respectively).The most sacred tree in Hinduism has 5 leaves in every leaf stunt.[clarification needed]Most of the flowers have 5 petals in them.The epic Mahabharata revolves around the battle between Duryodhana and his 99 other brothers and the 5 pandava princes—Dharma, Arjuna, Bhima, Nakula and Sahadeva.Christianity[edit]There are traditionally five wounds of Jesus Christ in Christianity: the Scourging at the Pillar, the Crowning with Thorns, the wounds in Christ's hands, the wounds in Christ's feet, and the Side Wound of Christ.[155]Gnosticism[edit]The number five was an important symbolic number in Manichaeism, with heavenly beings, concepts, and others often grouped in sets of five.Five Seals in SethianismFive Trees in the Gospel of ThomasIslam[edit]The Five Pillars of Islam[156]Muslims pray to Allah five times a day[157]According to Shia Muslims, the Panjetan or the Five Holy Purified Ones are the members of Muhammad's family: Muhammad, Ali, Fatimah, Hasan, and Husayn and are often symbolically represented by an image of the Khamsa.[158]Judaism[edit]The Torah contains five books—Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy—which are collectively called the Five Books of Moses, the Pentateuch (Greek for \\"five containers\\", referring to the scroll cases in which the books were kept), or Humash (חומש, Hebrew for \\"fifth\\").[159]The book of Psalms is arranged into five books, paralleling the Five Books of Moses.[160]The Khamsa, an ancient symbol shaped like a hand with four fingers and one thumb, is used as a protective amulet by Jews; that same symbol is also very popular in Arabic culture, known to protect from envy and the evil eye.[161]Sikhism[edit]The five sacred Sikh symbols prescribed by Guru Gobind Singh are commonly known as panj kakars or the \\"Five Ks\\" because they start with letter K representing kakka (ਕ) in the Punjabi language's Gurmukhi script. They are: kesh (unshorn hair), kangha (the comb), kara (the steel bracelet), kachhehra (the soldier's shorts), and kirpan (the sword) (in Gurmukhi: ਕੇਸ, ਕੰਘਾ, ਕੜਾ, ਕਛਹਰਾ, ਕਿਰਪਾਨ).[162] Also, there are five deadly evils: kam (lust), krodh (anger), moh (attachment), lobh (greed), and ankhar (ego).Daoism[edit]5 Elements[163]5 Emperors[164]Other religions and cultures[edit]According to ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle, the universe is made up of five classical elements: water, earth, air, fire, and ether. This concept was later adopted by medieval alchemists and more recently by practitioners of Neo-Pagan religions such as Wicca.The pentagram, or five-pointed star, bears mystic significance in various belief systems including Baháʼí, Christianity, Freemasonry, Satanism, Taoism, Thelema, and Wicca.In Cantonese, \\"five\\" sounds like the word \\"not\\" (character: 唔). When five appears in front of a lucky number, e.g. \\"58\\", the result is considered unlucky.In East Asian tradition, there are five elements: (water, fire, earth, wood, and metal).[165] The Japanese names for the days of the week, Tuesday through Saturday, come from these elements via the identification of the elements with the five planets visible with the naked eye.[166] Also, the traditional Japanese calendar has a five-day weekly cycle that can be still observed in printed mixed calendars combining Western, Chinese-Buddhist, and Japanese names for each weekday.In numerology, 5 or a series of 555, is often associated with change, evolution, love and abundance.Members of The Nation of Gods and Earths, a primarily African American religious organization, call themselves the \\"Five-Percenters\\" because they believe that only 5% of mankind is truly enlightened.[167]Art, entertainment, and media[edit]Fictional entities[edit]James the Red Engine, a fictional character numbered 5.[168]Johnny 5 is the lead character in the film Short Circuit (1986)[169]Number Five is a character in Lorien Legacies[170]Numbuh 5, real name Abigail Lincoln, from Codename: Kids Next DoorSankara Stones, five magical rocks in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom that are sought by the Thuggees for evil purposes[171]The Mach Five Mahha-gō?

This ratio corresponds to the interval of 2 octaves plus a pure major third. Thus, the interval of 5:4 is the interval of the pure third. A major triad chord when played in just intonation (most often the case in a cappella vocal ensemble singing), will contain such a pure major third.Using the Latin root, five musicians are called a quintet.[182]Five is the lowest possible number that can be the top number of a time signature with an asymmetric meter.Groups[edit]Five (group), a UK Boy band[183]The Five (composers), 19th-century Russian composers[184]5 Seconds of Summer, pop band that originated in Sydney, AustraliaFive Americans, American rock band active 1965–1969[185]Five Finger Death Punch, American heavy metal band from Las Vegas, Nevada.

An exception is the Super League, which uses static squad numbering.In rugby union:A try is worth 5 points.[210]One of the two starting lock forwards wears number 5, and usually jumps at number 4 in the line-out.In the French variation of the bonus points system, a bonus point in the league standings is awarded to a team that loses by 5 or fewer points.Technology[edit]5 as a resin identification code, used in recycling.5 is the most common number of gears for automobiles with manual transmission.[211]In radio communication, the term \\"Five by five\\" is used to indicate perfect signal strength and clarity.[212]On almost all devices with a numeric keypad such as telephones, computers, etc., the 5 key has a raised dot or raised bar to make dialing easier. Persons who are blind or have low vision find it useful to be able to feel the keys of a telephone. All other numbers can be found with their relative position around the 5 button (on computer keyboards, the 5 key of the numpad has the raised dot or bar, but the 5 key that shifts with % does not).[213]On most telephones, the 5 key is associated with the letters J, K, and L,[214] but on some of the BlackBerry phones, it is the key for G and H.The Pentium, coined by Intel Corporation, is a fifth-generation x86 architecture microprocessor.[215]The resin identification code used in recycling to identify polypropylene.[216]Miscellaneous fields[edit]International maritime signal flag for 5St. Petersburg Metro, Line 5The fives of all four suits in playing cardsFive can refer to:\\"Give me five\\" is a common phrase used preceding a high five.An informal term for the British Security Service, MI5.Five babies born at one time are quintuplets.

Embodying a symbol of balance and harmony, this cardinal digit is more than a mere numeral; it stands as an impactful presence across various domains of human understanding. The evolution of the Arabic numeral for five and its unique characteristics set it apart in the number line. But the potency of five extends beyond its mathematical stance.nnIn religion and culture, five appears as a foundational element. Within Hinduism, the god Shiva presents with five faces, signifying the expansive influence of number five's symbolism. Christianity speaks of the five sacred wounds of Jesus Christ, while Islam upholds the Five Pillars, illustrating the omnipresence of this number in spiritual practices around the world. Even in newer formats, like the Five-Percenters in the Nation of Gods and Earths, the emblematic power of five is undeniably significant.nnThe number five permeates into the realm of senses and biology, standing for the traditional number of human senses and often representing the sum of digits on a single hand or foot across most vertebrates. Its presence is found in the natural star-shaped design of most echinoderms or in the destructive ladder of the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale as Category 5. Notably, in astronomy, too, five dwarf planets within our solar system remind us of the compelling narrative of the number five.nnThe artistic representation of five is vast. From the five interlinked rings of the Olympic Games symbolizing global unity to five-pointed stars adorning numerous flags, and even the pentatonic scale forming the base of countless music compositions worldwide, number five is a recurring motif of importance and reverence.nnIt shapes technology as well, resonating in the design world as a universally accessible number on numeric keypads or recalling milestones in tech history like Intel's Pentium processor, a pivotal fifth-generation microprocessor. This extends to recycling as well, where five marks polypropylene in the resin identification code, signifying its recyclability and environmental footprint.nnBut the domain where five is truly quintessential is mathematics. It is the third prime number, integral to number theory's Pell sequence and is indivisible from the complexity of magic squares' design. It finds unique distinctions as the smallest Mersenne prime exponent and as a catalytic figure in Euler's identity, one of the most beautiful equations in mathematics.nnNumber five is not just found; it is experienced in the fabric of our lives, a reminder of the quintessential ties that bind the seemingly disparate elements of our world into a cohesive whole. It is a testament to the interconnectedness of all things, an emblem that resonates with harmony, balance, and cosmic order.\\"        }    },    \\"thoughts\\": {        \\"text\\": \\"I have written the first section of Chapter 1 for 'the quintessential five', based on the significant role of the number five in various contexts.

The thrilling, edge-of-your-seat twists will have readers questioning their own perspectives on loyalty, morality, and the dangers of emotional manipulation.Plot:Mia Thompson is a renowned psychology professor at a prestigious university, known for her extensive studies on emotional manipulation and deception. Harris, an FBI criminal profiler, is assigned the case of Eric Hall, a brilliant and dangerous con artist, whose latest lethal scheme left two men dead in a love triangle gone wrong. The FBI turns to Mia for her expertise in order to track down and outsmart Eric.Mia and Harris join forces, both of them aware that they are playing a high-stakes game against a criminal mastermind. As they sift through the twisted web that Eric has woven, Mia and Harris find clues pointing to hidden aspects of their own pasts. Their connection deepens and they begin to unlock long-buried secrets that force them to question their own morality and trust in others.Mia struggles with the ethics of using her expertise in psychological manipulation for their mission, afraid of becoming like the villain they are pursuing. Harris also confronts his past infidelities and the collapse of his previous marriage due to his own deceptive behavior.Together, they must navigate the blurred lines between good and evil, cautiously bearing the weight of their own deceptions as they race against the clock to stop Eric from completing his most elaborate and haunting plan yet.Twist Ending:In the final act of the story, Mia and Harris believe they have cornered Eric at a high-profile charity gala.

Here's a detailed rundown of what such a game might have featured, given the technical and design constraints of that era: Title Screen and Introduction:- Title Screen: A colorful pixel art title with the iconic Transformers logo and the option to press \\"Start\\" to commence the game.- Intro Sequence: A brief scrolling text or cutscene explaining the game's premise, where the evil Decepticons have captured some of the Autobots, and it's up to the rescue team to save them. Gameplay Mechanics:- Side-scrolling Platformer: The player controls a select group of Autobots through various levels, each with its unique obstacles and enemies.- Character Switching: Players can switch between different Autobots, each with unique abilities. For example, Bumblebee might be smaller and able to navigate tight spaces, while Optimus Prime can break through barriers.- Transforming Feature: Just as in the Transformers universe, the Autobots can transform between robot and vehicle modes, which would be essential for getting past certain obstacles and enemies.- Energy and Health: Autobots would have a health bar, possibly with energon as their life source, which diminishes when they take hits from enemies or hazards. Level Design:- Varied Environments: The game could take players through familiar Earth-based locations such as cities, forests, deserts, and Decepticon bases.- Platform Challenges: Each level would have platforms at different heights, requiring precise jumping. Power-ups could be placed on difficult-to-reach platforms.- Traps and Hazards: Pitfalls, moving platforms, spikes, and other obstacles would test the player's skill.- Enemy Decepticons: Each level could feature lesser-known Decepticons as regular enemies, with more iconic villains like Starscream, Soundwave, or Megatron as bosses. Audio-Visual Elements:- Graphics: 8-bit sprites for characters and environments, reflecting the art of the time.- Animation: Simple animations for walking, jumping, transforming, and attacks.- Music: A chiptune soundtrack reminiscent of the original Transformers theme and other catchy tunes for different levels.- Sound Effects: Retro blips and bloops for jumping, transforming, and laser fire. Additional Features:- Item Collectibles: Energon cubes for health, extra lives, and power-ups that temporarily enhance an Autobot's abilities.- Secret Areas: Hidden sections of the map that contain bonus items or shortcuts.- Score System: Points are awarded for defeating enemies, collecting items, and completing levels quickly.- End-of-Level: A detailed still frame or text narration after each level, driving the story forward and setting up the next stage. Narrative and Endgame:- Rescue Missions: The game would involve a series of levels where the primary goal is to rescue a captured Autobot at the end of each.- Final Boss: The ultimate showdown with Megatron in his stronghold.- Ending Cutscene: A triumphant conclusion with rescued Autobots and possibly a teaser for a future game.This hypothetical game would have likely pushed the boundaries of what was possible on platforms of the time such as the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) or Atari 2600, both in terms of technical complexity and storytelling. It could have been a cherished title among fans of the series, blending the excitement of Transformers with the enjoyment of classic platformers."},{"question":"问题:通过一个实例进行分析和讨论:为什么批量归一化不能直接应用于循环神经网络，谢谢。回答:批量归一化（Batch Normalization，BN）是一种在深度网络训练过程中用于加速网络训练、提高网络性能的方法。它主要解决了神经网络训练中的内部协方差偏移问题（Internal Covariate Shift），即每一层网络的输入分布在训练过程中不断发生变化。BN通过对每层的输入进行标准化（均值为0，方差为1），使其分布更加稳定，从而提高网络的训练速度和准确性。然而，将批量归一化直接应用于循环神经网络（Recurrent Neural Network，RNN）会面临一些问题。以下通过一个简化的RNN例子来分析：假设我们有一个简单的循环神经网络如下：┌───┐│x1 │└─┬─┘│RNN│┌─┴─┐│h1 │└───┘┌───┐│x2 │└─┬─┘│RNN│┌─┴─┐│h2 │└───┘在这个例子中，RNN接收两个输入x1和x2，并计算相应的隐藏状态h1和h2。在批量归一化的情景下，我们可能尝试对RNN内部进行标准化操作，即在每个时间步t对输入xt进行批量归一化。但在RNN中，有以下几个问题使得批量归一化不能直接应用：1. 序列长度可变：RNN的一个主要特点是能够处理可变长度的序列。在训练过程中，一个批次的序列长度可能不同，这就导致了批量归一化操作所需统计量（均值和方差）需要针对每个时间步的输入进行计算。因此，直接应用BN方法会导致计算效率低下，同时还可能影响模型的泛化能力。2. 循环连接：在RNN中，隐藏状态ht依赖于上一时间步的隐藏状态ht-1。这种循环连接的存在使得网络的每一层在不同时间步的输入分布会受到先前时间步的影响。这种情况下，直接应用BN方法可能会对整个序列产生连锁反应，从而影响模型的性能。3. 隐藏状态依赖：与卷积神经网络（Convolutional Neural Network，CNN）等前馈神经网络不同，RNN的当前隐藏状态与前一隐藏状态有很大的关联性。直接应用BN方法可能导致当前隐藏状态在归一化后与前一隐藏状态变得无关，从而削弱了RNN记忆序列特征的能力。为解决这些问题，研究人员提出了一种名为Layer Normalization的方法。该方法沿着特征维度（而不是批量维度）计算标准化统计量，使得标准化操作不再依赖于批量大小。由于这种方法在每个时间步都使用相同的标准化参数，因此它更适合循环神经网络结构。        请你进一步优化以上回答","answer":"批量归一化（Batch Normalization，BN）是用于加速深度网络训练过程和提高网络性能的一种方法。它解决了神经网络训练中的内部协方差偏移问题（Internal Covariate Shift），即每一层网络的输入分布在训练过程中会发生变化。BN方法通过对每层输入进行标准化处理（使分布的均值为0，方差为1），使其分布变得更稳定，从而提高网络训练速度和准确性。然而，直接将批量归一化应用于循环神经网络（Recurrent Neural Network，RNN）会遇到一些问题。在以下简化的RNN例子中，我们来分析这些问题：假设我们有一个简单的循环神经网络结构如下：┌───┐│x1 │└─┬─┘│RNN│┌─┴─┐│h1 │└───┘┌───┐│x2 │└─┬─┘│RNN│┌─┴─┐│h2 │└───┘在这个例子中，RNN接收两个输入x1和x2，并计算相应的隐藏状态h1和h2。在考虑批量归一化时，我们可能会尝试在RNN内部对每个时间步t的输入xt进行标准化。然而，在RNN中存在以下几个问题，使得批量归一化无法直接应用：1. 序列长度可变：RNN的一个显著特点是能够处理可变长度的序列。在训练过程中，一个批次序列长度可能不同，这导致批量归一化操作所需的统计量（均值和方差）需要针对每个时间步的输入进行计算。因此，直接应用BN方法会导致计算效率下降，同时可能影响模型的泛化能力。2. 循环连接：在RNN中，隐藏状态ht依赖于上一个时间步的隐藏状态ht-1。这种循环连接的存在使得网络的每一层在不同时间步的输入分布会受到之前时间步的影响。这样的情况下，直接应用BN方法可能会引起整个序列之间的连锁反应，从而影响模型性能。3. 隐藏状态依赖：与卷积神经网络（Convolutional Neural Network，CNN）等前馈神经网络不同，RNN的当前隐藏状态与之前的隐藏状态有很大关联性。直接应用BN方法可能会导致当前隐藏状态在归一化后与之前的隐藏状态之间的关联性丧失，从而削弱RNN在记忆序列特征方面的能力。为了解决这些问题，研究人员提出了一种名为Layer Normalization的方法。该方法是在特征维度（而非批量维度）上计算标准化统计量，使得标准化操作不再依赖于批量大小。由于这种方法在每个时间步都使用相同的标准化参数，因此它更适合应用于循环神经网络。"},{"question":"please write an academical article about Worship of Foreign Culture and Flattery as Rebellion in Cultural Dissemination","answer":"Title: Worship of Foreign Culture and Flattery as Rebellion in Cultural DisseminationAbstractThe dissemination of cultural elements between different societies has become more prevalent in the age of globalization. However, the adoption of foreign culture in certain instances can lead to the dismissal or degradation of indigenous cultures, creating tensions within the society. In this paper, we will explore the worship of foreign culture and flattery as acts of rebellion in cultural dissemination. We argue that these acts of rebellion must be recognized and perceived as the key elements affecting the equilibrium between cultural authenticity and globalization. This will help ensure a more equitable cultural exchange between different societies.IntroductionThe process of cultural dissemination has allowed societies to learn from one another, enhance the understanding of different traditions, and encourage a global dialogue. However, it also creates issues that lead to the replacement or invalidation of indigenous cultures and customs. The tendency to worship foreign cultures and flattery often arises from the need to fit in or belong, which can be seen as an act of rebellion against one's own culture.Worship of Foreign Culture: An Act of RebellionThe worship of foreign cultures, often referred to as cultural cringe, occurs when individuals in a society perceive another culture to be of higher value or worth than their own. This act of rebellion against one's own culture might stem from the belief that the foreign customs, practices, and beliefs are more progressive or sophisticated.Historically, this has occurred during periods of colonization and imperialism when dominant cultures imposed their values and beliefs on indigenous populations, leading to the adoption of foreign cultural practices. These values were often touted as being advanced, rational or civilized, contributing to the decline of indigenous cultures as they were replaced by foreign ones.However, the worship of foreign culture does not solely occur due to external influences. In many instances, the dissemination of cultural elements can be fueled by internal factors as well. For example, education systems, media representation, and social networks can all contribute to the idealization and romanticization of foreign cultures. This is evident in members of a society who begin to adopt clothing, music, or even accents of a foreign culture to appear educated, worldlier, or more fashionable – all instances of rebellion against their local culture.Flattery as a Form of Rebellion in Cultural DisseminationFlattery can be seen as another form of rebellion in the context of cultural dissemination. Rather than outright adopting aspects of a foreign culture, people may attempt to appease or impress members of another culture by imitating or praising their customs, practices, and beliefs. However, this flattery can also entail the dismissal or disregard of one's own cultural practices, leading to a loss of cultural authenticity or a distortion of genuine cultural exchange.This form of rebellion can be observed in scenarios ranging from international diplomacy and cultural tourism to personal relationships between individuals of different cultural backgrounds. As a result, the flattered culture may become aware of this and adopt a more dominant role, further exacerbating cultural power imbalances and contributing to the erosion of the flattering society's culture.Discussion: Balancing Cultural Authenticity and GlobalizationRecognizing the presence of rebellion in cultural dissemination through the worship of foreign culture and flattery brings attention to the need for a balance between cultural authenticity and globalization. To achieve this equilibrium, the importance of cultural preservation should not be understated. Educating individuals on their own culture, strengthening cultural institutions, and promoting a diverse representation in media can help foster a greater appreciation for one's own cultural heritage while embracing the global exchange of ideas and customs.Moreover, it is essential to acknowledge the complexities of cultural exchange and identify acts of rebellion within these exchanges. Open dialogue between cultural groups and awareness of power dynamics can help create an environment where individuals can appreciate and respect other cultures without undermining their own values and customs.ConclusionThe worship of foreign culture and flattery as acts of rebellion in cultural dissemination underscores the need to evaluate the implications of cultural exchanges and globalization on a societal level. By recognizing and addressing these rebellious behaviors, we can strive towards a more equitable cultural exchange that promotes a sense of global belonging without eradicating cultural authenticity.

Historically, a wide range of animals have been featured in circuses around the world, but the modern trend is increasingly moving away from the use of wild animals in response to animal welfare concerns and legal restrictions. Here are some examples of animals that have been or still are used in circuses:1. Elephants: Once a staple of traditional circuses, elephants have been phased out by many circuses due to ethical concerns and the complexity of their care needs.2. Big Cats: Lions, tigers, and leopards have been popular circus animals. However, their use has also declined in many places because of welfare concerns and regulatory changes. 3. Horses: Horses have been part of circuses for a long time, performing various tricks and routines. They are still common in circuses that focus on animal performances, especially those with a tradition of equestrian acts. 4. Domestic Animals: Dogs, pigs, goats, and other domestic animals are often used in circuses, performing a variety of tricks. These animals tend to be more adaptable to the training and travel associated with circuses.5. Birds: Parrots, macaws, and sometimes birds of prey are featured for their ability to perform tricks or for display purposes.6. Marine Mammals: Though more common in marine parks than traditional circuses, dolphins and seals have been used in circuses or circus-like performances, especially in mobile aquatic shows.7. Exotic Animals: Camels, llamas, and other exotic animals sometimes appear in circuses, used in parades or as part of exotic animal acts.The trend towards more humane treatment of animals and stricter regulations has led to significant changes in the circus industry. Many circuses now focus on human performances such as acrobatics, juggling, clown acts, and aerial feats, eliminating animal acts from their shows altogether. The use of virtual reality and other technologies also offers new ways to create an exciting experience without live animals. It's important to note that the legality and ethics of using animals in circuses are subjects of ongoing debate, and laws vary significantly by country and even within regions of countries. Several countries and local jurisdictions have enacted bans or restrictions on the use of animals in circuses, reflecting growing public concern for animal welfare and changing attitudes toward the use of animals for entertainment."},{"question":"(Just outside the main Azur Lane base…)Enterprise: “We need healing, Vestal! Vestal?! Vestal, can you hear me?!”Vestal: (looking at the thorny rose in her hand) “…”Enterprise: “VESTAL, LISTEN TO ME!!!”Vestal: “A flower, once withered, will not bloom again…a life, once lost, will not return…”Enterprise: “Vestal, what are you talking about?!”Vestal: “The weight of a life cannot be simply measured with a scale. Overdependence on the kindness of others is a sickness of its own, Enterprise. And now…the life of these Sirens are mine to take! Fire at will!”(Without another word, Vestal suddenly rushes forward, the once-gentle repair ship’s face hardened into a fierce expression Enterprise has never seen before. Confusion washes over Enterprise as she watches the sisterly figure transform into something unrecognizable, brandishing firepower with a determination so cold it chills her to the bone. By the time Vestal is done with her furious onslaught, the Sirens in her path lay in ruins, testament to a resolve forged from something beyond her usual caring nature.)Enterprise is left staring, dumbfounded, at the now-calm ocean that was moments ago a fierce battleground, trying to reconcile the healer she knew with the warrior she had just witnessed. Both are Vestal, yet the dissonance is jarring. As the smoky haze begins to clear, Vestal turns back to Enterprise, her face returning to its gentle composure.)Vestal: “Every life is sacred, Enterprise, but the battlefield demands choices that can weigh heavily on the heart. Sometimes, we must rise beyond our defined roles to protect those we care for.”(Enterprise, still reeling from the shock of Vestal’s unexpected transformation, nods slowly. She understands more than anyone the burden of roles and expectations, the weight of decisions made in the heat of battle.)Enterprise: “Vestal… You’re right. But why now, what changed?”Vestal approaches Enterprise with a menacing gleam in her eyes.Vestal: “The Vestal you knew is","answer":" no longer the same. I've realized that the battlefield does not only require healers. Sometimes, we must be warriors to ensure there are lives left to heal. The threat of the Sirens continues to grow, and our tactics must evolve with it. My purpose has expanded, Enterprise. I will protect and heal, but I will also fight with all my might when our foes threaten the peace we all hold dear.”Enterprise takes a moment, reflecting on Vestal's words and the fierce determination behind them.Enterprise: “You've always been one of our pillars of support, Vestal. Your decision to take up arms in such a way...it's a heavy responsibility. But know this, we stand together, as a fleet, in this fight. We’ll face whatever comes our way, side by side.”Vestal: “I'm glad to hear that, Enterprise. My actions today were driven by necessity, but I have no intention of abandoning my duties as a healer. Both roles will be a part of who I am, and I'll fulfill them to the best of my ability.”The exchange between the two shipgirls comes to a close as they gaze out at the sea, united in their resolve. Enterprise understands that war pushes everyone to their limits, and sometimes beyond the roles they were initially designed for. Together, they turn back towards the Azur Lane base, ready to support their comrades in whatever capacity needed, whether it be healing, fighting, or simply giving strength to one another in these turbulent times."},{"question":"Two companies that are mentioned but never seen are the Hazardous Environment Combat Company (HECC) and the National Security Intelligence Agency (NSIA). NSIA is a rival to the CIA and the HECC is similar to the HECU from Half-Life.","answer":"Incorporating the Hazardous Environment Combat Company (HECC) and the National Security Intelligence Agency (NSIA) as unseen yet influential entities in your manga could create an intricate web of power dynamics and intrigue that enriches your world-building. These organizations hint at a larger, more complex geopolitical landscape that impacts your characters and storyline. Let's explore how these entities can be woven into the fabric of your narrative: Hazardous Environment Combat Company (HECC)Drawing on the inspiration from the HECU (Hazardous Environment Combat Unit) in Half-Life, the HECC could serve as a highly specialized military force equipped to deal with extraordinary threats, such as biochemical hazards, supernatural occurrences, or advanced technological menaces. While they remain unseen, their presence and actions can be felt throughout the story:- Missions and Impact: Characters might encounter situations drastically altered by the HECC's interventions, such as quarantined areas, aftermaths of skirmishes against non-conventional threats, or the political and social ramifications of their operations.- Reputation: The HECC could be shrouded in mystery and rumors, contributing to a climate of fear and speculation among civilians and the underworld alike. Characters, including Leo, might have differing opinions about the HECC's true intentions and effectiveness, reflecting broader themes of security vs. freedom and the moral ambiguities of wielding such power.- Narrative Device: The HECC's involvement in certain events could serve as a plot device to introduce new challenges, allies, or enemies for Leo. Their actions might indirectly intersect with his missions, complicating his objectives or forcing him to adapt to unexpected changes in his environment. National Security Intelligence Agency (NSIA)Positioned as a rival to the CIA, the NSIA could represent a shadowy and formidable force in the world of intelligence, espionage, and covert operations. Their rivalry with the CIA could hint at internal conflicts within the global intelligence community, as well as the delicate balance of power and information:- Influence and Manipulation: The NSIA's maneuvers in the shadows could affect geopolitical stability, influence criminal organizations, or even manipulate markets and political outcomes. Characters might find themselves caught in the crossfire of their operations or inadvertently aiding one of their schemes.- Morally Grey Characters: Introducing agents or assets affiliated with the NSIA could provide opportunities for morally complex characters who challenge Leo's worldview and alliances. These characters could have their own reasons for opposing the CIA or aligning with the NSIA, offering shades of grey in a world predominantly viewed through the lens of right and wrong.- Plot Twists and Revelations: The secretive nature of the NSIA's operations could pave the way for surprise plot twists and revelations, impacting Leo's journey and forcing him to question what he knows about the global power structure and his place within it.By carefully integrating the HECC and NSIA into your story, you can craft a narrative that feels expansive and deeply connected, even if these organizations primarily operate off-screen. Their influence can drive the plot, create tension, and deepen the thematic exploration of power, ethics, and the role of individuals like Leo in a world dominated by such shadowy forces."},{"question":"Write an romcom anime scene about a young man casually chatting with his dom. His dom is his childhood friend. She wears a tank-top, jeans, a red bandana and fingerless leather gloves. She is sitting cross-legged watching TV while that young man is sitting on his knees next to her. She is buff. She's caressing a coiled up belt. His girlfriend is at work and she told his childhood friend to hang around their home because she's making a nice lunch. She very politely told her to not do anything stupid. She comes back a hour later and she facepalms.","answer":"Title: Unintended BondsScene: The interior of a modest, sunlit apartment living room. There are personal touches everywhere, making it clear two people live here — a mix of cute couple photos and some quirky collectibles. The young man, Yuki, kneels attentively on the floor next to the couch, which is occupied by Kazumi, his dom and childhood friend. The TV is playing a popular romantic comedy show, but their attention is more on their conversation than the screen.Kazumi is the picture of casual dominance with an air of nonchalance, her attire—a tank top, jeans, and fingerless leather gloves—accentuating her muscular build. A red bandana rests atop her head, adding to her tough yet playful appearance. She sits relaxed and cross-legged, with a subtle smirk playing on her lips as she idly caresses the coiled belt in her hands—an understated symbol of their unique dynamic.Yuki: (leaning slightly towards Kazumi) \\"So Suzu says the meeting might take longer, but knowing her, she'll breeze through it. She's so passionate that I swear half the time they just agree because they can't keep up with her.\\"Kazumi: (chuckles) \\"Sounds like someone else I know. Passion can be pretty convincing, Yuki. Also, why do you sit like that? The floor has to be uncomfortable.\\"Yuki: (shifting his position self-consciously) \\"Haha, maybe, but I don't mind it. Especially not when I'm in good company.\\"Kazumi: (teasingly) \\"But is my company as good as Suzu's? After all, she’s your girlfriend.\\"Yuki: (blushes but meets her gaze with confidence) \\"Different kind of good, Kazumi. You know how it is.\\"Kazumi: (gently tugs the belt, a hint of wickedness in her tone) \\"Remember our safe word, Yuki?\\"Yuki: (smiles) \\"Of course. Hard to forget with you around.\\"They share a moment of laughter, comfortable with their unique relationship, even as the lines blur between childhood friendship and their more adult arrangement. The scene is cozy and innocent, despite the undercurrents of their bond.Suddenly, the sound of keys in the door heralds Suzu's arrival. Kazumi glances at the clock relishing in the fact that, true to form, Suzu is coming home an hour early. Yuki gets up hastily, trying to put some normal distance between him and Kazumi.Suzu enters, carrying a couple of shopping bags. Her expression is tired but softens when she sees Yuki. That is until she takes in the full scene: Yuki on his feet smoothing out his clothes, Kazumi still languid on the sofa holding a coiled belt, her smile not fading in the least, and the edges of a romantic setting that were clearly getting underway.Suzu: (sighs deeply and facepalms, the bags making a thud as they hit the floor) \\"Kazumi, I said, 'Don't do anything stupid.' I didn't mean for you to interpret that as a challenge.\\"Kazumi: (shrugs, her smile unfazed) \\"Stupid? I was just looking after Yuki here, making sure he's not getting into any trouble... while you weren't here to supervise.”Yuki: (swiftly, trying to defuse the tension) \\"We were just talking! And um, watching TV.\\"Suzu looks at the TV—the romcom playing seems to mock the absurdity of their own situation. She can't help but let out a laugh.Suzu: (shaking her head) \\"Only you two could turn a lunch date into a scene straight out of an anime.\\"She walks over to Yuki, plants a kiss on his cheek, and then to Kazumi's surprise, offers her a grin.Suzu: (playfully) \\"Alright, sensei, lunch's on me today. But next time, stick to the script of 'just friends,' okay?\\"Kazumi responds with a respectful nod but winks at Yuki, all three of them understanding the dance they navigate between tradition and the unorthodox contours of friendship and love.Fade out as they sit together, the three of them now crowding the couch, sharing a meal and companionship with a subtle undercurrent of affection and amusement, it's clear that Suzu is just as much a part of this unconventional but loving dynamic.

Yet, the insatiable engine of its expansion and growth required ever more resources to sustain. It was within this context that the GKF set its sights on the United States, a nation financially and militarily drained, its economy teetering on the brink of collapse from the combined pressures of the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis and its protracted military commitments in the Middle East.The Debt CrisisThe core of the impending conflict lay in the immense debt owed by the United States to the APEX Corporation, totaling 14 trillion dollars, accrued through investments in advanced military technology. Unable to meet its financial obligations, the U.S. found itself in a precarious position, with the GKF, backed by the formidable might of the KPA, poised to collect on its debts by any means necessary.Anti-American SentimentAnti-American sentiment within the GKF had reached a fever pitch. The narrative propagated by Kim Jong-Un's regime painted the United States as a faltering empire, its unpaid debts symbolic of a broader moral and financial bankruptcy. In this atmosphere of heightened nationalism and pride, the GKF's populace rallied behind the idea of a decisive campaign to extract what was owed, viewing it as both a practical necessity and a moral imperative.Secret DiplomacyIn a series of clandestine meetings, Kim Jong-Un brokered secret deals with the European Union and Britain, proposing the division of the United States' territory in exchange for support in a joint operation against Russia—now a resurgent neo-Trotskyist state threatening Eastern Europe and Central Asia—and Israel, which had fallen under neo-Stalinist rule. These agreements represented a dramatic reshaping of global alliances, with former adversaries united by mutual interest and a shared vision of a post-U.S. world order.The Stage is SetAs the GKF prepared for its inevitable assault on the United States, strategic plans were laid down for a campaign that would leverage the full spectrum of the Federation's military capabilities. The KPA began extensive simulations and war games, testing out new strategies and technologies that would be deployed in the forthcoming conflict. Among these was the advanced use of Goliath drones and cyber warfare tactics designed to cripple the U.S.'s already weakened defenses.The Global Tapestry UnravelsMeanwhile, the global geopolitical tapestry continued to unravel. Russia’s aggression towards its neighbors, coupled with the genocidal policies of Israel's neo-Stalinist regime, stretched European, British, and Saudi forces thin. In a desperate bid to counter the GKF's influence, the U.S., Russia, and Israel covertly funded Christian fundamentalist movements led by former ROK and Nationalist Chinese leaders, aiming to 'liberate' Korea and China from the GKF and the restored Beiyang Government.ConclusionAs the GKF positioned itself to launch its campaign against the United States, the world stood on the precipice of a seismic shift. The ensuing conflict promised not only to redraw the map of North America but also to alter fundamentally the global balance of power. At the heart of this impending storm was Kim Jong-Un's ambition, a vision of a new world order with the GKF at its helm, dictating the future course of nations and empires alike."},{"question":"explain more on why it can cause cognitive impairment?","answer":"Sleep is crucial for cognitive processes, and impairing it can have several detrimental effects on brain function. Here are some reasons why lack of sleep leads to cognitive impairment:1. Memory Consolidation: Sleep plays a vital role in memory consolidation—the process by which short-term memories are strengthened and transformed into long-lasting memories. During certain stages of sleep, particularly rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and slow-wave sleep (deep sleep), the brain reorganizes and consolidates information from the day. Without adequate sleep, this process is disrupted, leading to difficulties with learning and memory retention.2. Neural Plasticity: Sleep is believed to contribute to neural plasticity—the ability of the brain to change and adapt in response to new experiences. Insufficient sleep can hinder the brain's capacity to make these adaptations, thus affecting learning and memory.3. Attention and Concentration: Being well-rested helps maintain alertness and the ability to focus. Lack of sleep can lead to a decreased attention span and difficulties in focusing, which can impair performance in tasks that require sustained concentration.4. Executive Function: Sleep deprivation affects the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for executive functions such as decision-making, problem-solving, and impulse control. When sleep-deprived, individuals may have trouble with planning, prioritizing, and exhibit poor judgment.5. Cognitive Slowing: Sleep deprivation can slow cognitive processing speed. This means it can take longer to perform mental tasks and respond to stimuli, which can decrease performance in both academic and work settings.6. Increased Error Rate: As a result of all of the above effects, individuals who lack sleep are more prone to making errors. This includes both action slips (errors in familiar routine tasks) and lapses in vigilance (failing to maintain attention on a task over time).7. Disruption of Brain Communication: Sleep deprivation can disrupt the communication between neurons in the brain. This can have a multitude of effects on cognitive function, as effective neuronal communication is fundamental to everything the brain does.8. Emotional Regulation: Cognitive impairment from sleep deprivation isn't purely intellectual; it can also affect emotional regulation. When individuals are sleep-deprived, the brain's emotional centers can become overly reactive, making it more difficult to handle stress and potentially compounding cognitive impairment through increased emotional responses.Sleep serves to \\"reset\\" brain functions critical for cognitive performance, and without it, there is a build-up of adenosine and other neurotransmitters that can impair brain function. Moreover, recent studies suggest that sleep also serves as a period for the brain to clear out metabolic waste products that can be neurotoxic, such as beta-amyloid, which is implicated in Alzheimer's disease.Therefore, to maintain cognitive health and performance, adequate sleep is a necessity. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious repercussions on overall brain health and cognitive longevity."},{"question":"Can you help me write a speech about my Interview I had with my Calculus BC teacher Mr. Jatinder Singh, where I deliver an introduction of the person as though this person were to be a guest speaker, and include reasons why the audience would want to hear this person speak.

My goals- Application of concepts/skills- Build your critical thinking skills- Prepare you for higher level math course/college readiness3. Set high expectations- You have chosen to be in a higher level, fast paced course- You have the capacity to do better than you thinkFrom a newspaper article:Jatinder Singh is calculus kingTeacher known for unique styleEverybody needs to have a teacher like Jatinder Singh at least once in their lifetime.These are the words of senior Hao Ouyang, a former AP Calculus BC student of Singh’s.Ouyang is not the only Cal High student who believes this.Singh, who teaches Honors Precalculus and AP Calculus BC, is known for his unique teaching methods that are derived from his background in engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, which is ranked among India’s top five universities.This style coupled with his background spending 25 years in the corporate sector distinguishes Singh from other math teachers.“Rather than teaching [students] the mechanics of doing things, I focus more on how they can apply these things to real life situations,” Singh said.For this reason, Ouyang was shocked when he took his first quiz which was harder than he originally anticipated.“When I walked in there, it made me a different person. I thought you could just read the textbook and not do anything else. Then when you actually take the test, it’s like a slap in the face, like a big reality check,” Ouyang said.Through this quiz, he began to understand what Singh meant when he said math was a tool.While students agreed that Singh’s math class is not as simple as it seemed, what surprised them even more is that he loves packing his class with life lessons.“My class is not only about teaching math or physics, but also about giving a larger perspective to the students, and also what you need to be successful in life,” Singh said.“I was able to get both math development and personal development in the class,” Zhen said.Although Singh’s flexible teaching style wasn’t her favorite and she preferred more structured lessons, she enjoyed solving his “super hard” math problems and she felt proud of her growth.Making a math class relatable to students can be tough, however students said that Singh possesses a lot of talents which a lot of students can connect and relate to.“He does art. He showed us his drawings, like at the beginning of the school year. This definitely shocked me. I can conclude that this man is very talented and smart,” Zhen said.Zhen felt more connected to him since she does art, as she plans on going into industrial design in college.Students concluded that Singh’s class shows us that people don’t only improve in their math skills, they go far beyond that and improve themselves in the process.“I’m basically a physics person, and math was invented to understand the real life situation where physics was invented. Math and physics are intertwined. In my engineering days, we have done a number of physics problems, including quantum physics,” Singh said.This skill set allowed Singh to help students who were struggling in physics, as Cal didn´t have an AP Physics class last year, which made many students take it online.His teaching methods also reflect on the class environment, which has had a positive impact on the students.“There was a really good atmosphere. I feel like most people really liked that. Like, it kind of inspired me and motivated me in some way, something I was never expecting from a math class. There are so many people who are genuinely really into math, ” Zhen said.Current and past students share different techniques that helped make their calculus journey a successful one.Zhen said that forming study groups and bonding with the students in the class is useful.“You get a lot from studying with other people,” Zhen continued.Liu-Zhou said that students should know what they are getting themselves into before they decide to take Singh’s class.“It was a pretty big time commitment, so students should be prepared to spend at least two hours on the homework every night,” Liu-Zhou said.Ouyang agrees with Liu-Zhou, that the content is a lot of work.“They [students] should not just walk in there, thinking they know how to do everything, because, well, they are about to be disappointed, so be a diligent student and practice as many hard problems as you can,” Ouyang said.Singh’s past students said that students should be accountable for their own learning process and not procrastinate in his class.“Don’t be that person that doesn’t study for the test and just gets answers from their teammates because that’s annoying,” senior Aaron Hsi, a past AP Calculus BC student, said.Past honors precalculus and current AP Calculus BC student, senior Xinrong Zhu also said that if students don’t understand Singh’s lectures, it is their job to go get help from him and have him explain it till they understand the concept.Singh’s students feel that his class is designed to help avid math lovers achieve in all aspects in their life, and help them build a better relationship with a very abstract subject.“I learned the most out of that class than any of my classes in my junior year,” Hsi concluded.Background Information:1.

Nick Wilde, a sly but charismatic fox, sits across from Officer Judy Hopps, a dedicated and optimistic rabbit cop. They've been partners on the police force for a while, but today, Judy wants to understand Nick's backstory better.]Judy Hopps: [Leaning forward with earnest curiosity] Nick, you always have a way of dodging personal questions with a joke or a clever remark. But today, I really want to understand your story. How did you become... well, you?[Nick takes a deep breath and runs a paw through his fur, contemplating where to start. He's not used to opening up, but he trusts Judy.]Nick Wilde: [Smiles wryly] Where to begin, Carrots? You know, I wasn't always the smooth-talking, law-abiding fox you see today.[Judy nods encouragingly, urging him to continue.]Nick Wilde: [His expression grows more serious] It all started when I was just a kid. I wanted to join the scouts, be part of something good. My mom scraped together enough money to buy me a brand-new scout uniform. I was so proud, Judy. For the first time, I felt like I could be more than just a sly fox.Judy Hopps: [Eagerly listening] What happened?Nick Wilde: [A shadow crosses his face] Well, let's just say the other kids didn't take too kindly to a fox wanting to fit in. They lured me into a alley, slapped a muzzle on me, and... well, they showed me that no matter how hard I tried, I'd always be just a shifty fox to them.[Judy's eyes fill with sympathy, her own experiences with prejudice allowing her to empathize deeply with Nick.]Judy Hopps: Nick, I'm so sorry. That must have been terrible.Nick Wilde: [Shrugs, a bitter smile playing on his lips] It taught me a valuable lesson, though. Never show the world who you really are. It's easier to play the role everyone expects from you.Judy Hopps: But that's not who you are, Nick. Not really. You're one of the most caring and loyal friends I've ever had.[Nick looks at Judy, his usual facade softening at her words.]Nick Wilde: [Quietly] You might be one of the only ones to think that, Carrots. After that day, I embraced the stereotype. Became the fox everyone thought I was supposed to be. Con artist, hustler... you name it. It was easier than getting hurt again.Judy Hopps: But look at you now. You're a police officer making a real difference in Zootopia.Nick Wilde: [Locks eyes with Judy, a glimmer of gratitude in his] And I have you to thank for that. You saw past the stereotype and gave me a chance. I guess... I guess you reminded me that I could be more than what the world expects me to be.Judy Hopps: [Smiles warmly] We're more than what others say we are, Nick. We prove that every day.[Nick nods, his usual confident smile returning as he looks at Judy with newfound respect and camaraderie.]Nick Wilde: Thanks, Carrots. For everything. You know, sharing all this... doesn't feel as bad as I thought it would.Judy Hopps: [Grins] That's what friends are for, Nick. To listen, support, and push each other to be our best selves.[Nick chuckles, shaking his head in amusement. Their conversation continues into the evening, a little lighter now, as they delve into plans for their next big case together.][End scene.]"},{"question":"Crie uma ótima e bem explicado e persuasivas reflexão sobre provérbio 23 com muita fé, e baseando em algum grande pregador evangélico de sua escolha comece fazendo três ótimos titulo muito curtos, depois crie uma introdução que atraia as pessoas a ficar assistindo o vídeo, agora desenvolva a reflexão com tudo que pedi no começo, se preferir pode dividir em partes e depois desenvolve parte por parte ,faça uma ótima e completa reflexão, depois faca uma bela oração relacionada ao tema com muita empolgação e devoção ,quero fixar que será um vídeo para o youtube.

Sábios Conselhos para Vidas Enriquecidas2. Desvendando Tesouros em Provérbios 233. Alimentando a Alma com a Sabedoria Divina Introdução:Bem-vindos, amados irmãos e irmãs, à nossa reflexão de hoje, voltada para um coração sedento pela sabedoria que transcende o entendimento humano e busca a profundidade da espiritualidade cristã! Hoje, vamos mergulhar nas ricas verdades de Provérbios 23, sob a orientação do Espírito Santo e a sabedoria compartilhada por um dos grandes pregadores de nosso tempo, o Reverendo Billy Graham, homem de Deus que com sua fé e dedicação nos mostrou o caminho para uma vida plena em Cristo. Preparem-se para uma jornada rumo ao crescimento espiritual e à transformação pessoal. Reflexão:Parte 1: A Sabedoria no CoraçãoO capítulo 23 de Provérbios nos abre os olhos para a verdadeira fonte de sabedoria: o coração alinhado com os preceitos do Senhor. Billy Graham nos ensinou que, \\"a sabedoria consiste em aplicar a Palavra de Deus em nosso cotidiano\\". Ao falarmos em sabedoria, não nos referimos simplesmente ao conhecimento ou erudição, mas à capacidade de discernir o bem do mal nos momentos decisivos de nossa vida. É nos versículos 12-14 deste capítulo que somos convidados a aplicar o nosso coração à instrução e os nossos ouvidos, às palavras do conhecimento, pois a disciplina, embora pareça dura no momento, é o caminho para a vida.Parte 2: Guardando o Coração\\"Guarda o teu coração acima de tudo, porque dele emanam as fontes da vida\\", ecoa em Provérbios 4:23, e neste capítulo 23, somos novamente lembrados da importância de vigiar nossos corações. O convite é para não invejarmos os pecadores em nosso coração (v. 17), mas antes, nutrirmos constantemente o nosso coração na presença de Deus, o verdadeiro alimento para nossa alma. Billy Graham, com sua vida de devoção e fé, demonstrou que ao manter o coração limpo e focado em Deus, podemos resistir às diversas tentações que nos cercam.Parte 3: A Vida Além das AparênciasProvérbios 23:4-5 nos adverte sobre a busca incessante pela riqueza e pelo sucesso terreno, nos lembrando de que a verdadeira riqueza se encontra na nossa relação com Deus. \\"Não te fatigues para enriqueceres; deixa de ser sábio aos teus próprios olhos\\", nos aconselha o sábio. Billy Graham vivenciou isso ao pregar a Cristo acima de tudo, enfatizando que nossa maior conquista é o relacionamento com Deus, aquele que jamais nos abandonará ou nos decepcionará. Oração Empolgada e Devotada:Oh, Pai Celestial, nós Te agradecemos profundemente pelo Teu amor e Tua sabedoria que nos guiam através dos complexos caminhos desta vida. Que possamos, com corações humildes e espíritos sedentos, buscar a Tua sabedoria em cada decisão, cada passo e cada desafio que enfrentamos. Que a Tua Palavra seja a luz que ilumina o nosso caminho e o alicerce sobre o qual construímos a nossa existência. Ajuda-nos, Senhor, a guardar o nosso coração de toda a inveja e cobiça, mantendo os nossos olhos fixos em Ti, a verdadeira fonte de vida e paz eterna. Por Cristo Jesus, amém. Encerramento:Irmãos e irmãs, espero que esta reflexão tenha tocado seus corações e alimentado suas almas com a sabedoria que só pode ser encontrada em Deus.

However, I can explain how you might be able to create or find an image like that yourself.1. Photo Editing Software: You can use software like Adobe Photoshop or GIMP to edit an existing image of a black semi-automatic, top-load washing machine. You would start with a base image of the washing machine, then use the software's tools to add in the minor dents and scratches. You could also search for or create an image of a warehouse background and composite the two images together to achieve the desired effect.2. Stock Photo Websites: You may be able to find a photo that fits your requirements on stock photo websites like Shutterstock, Adobe Stock, or iStock. These sites have extensive collections of images, including appliances and warehouse backgrounds. You might not find an exact match for your description, but you could find something close and then edit it as needed.3. 3D Modeling Software: Software like Blender, Autodesk Maya, or SketchUp can be used to create 3D models of objects and scenes. You could model the washing machine, apply textures to simulate the black color, minor dents, and scratches, and then create a warehouse scene where you can place the washing machine model. This method requires a fair amount of skill and time but would allow for a high level of customization.Remember, if you're using any images that you don’t own or create from scratch, make sure to have the proper licenses or permissions to edit and use them, especially for commercial purposes."},{"question":"Please write a fictional, comedic and vividly detailed story about the flatulent ogre Shrek and his harem of villager twinks (compliment their physiques, faces, and butts).

Magical Swordsman and Summoner and Fate/Stay Night in which before the canon events of Naruto start, sometime before Madara and Hashirama fight each other, the Ōtsutsuki clan [Naruto], which [the  Ōtsutsuki clan] is [the  Ōtsutsuki clan] descended from [the  Ōtsutsuki clan's parent house in this scenario] the Jurai Empire's [Tenchi Muyo] imperial family, the Masaki dynasty [Tenchi Muyo], in this scenario, [the  Ōtsutsuki clan]  leaves the Elemental Nations [Naruto] sometime after the Great Catalysm [Naruto] and [the  Ōtsutsuki clan] settles in post-Great Catayslm Japan, more specifically post-Great Cataclysm Kyoto, rebuilding and restructuring the old Japanese capital [Kyoto] into its [the  Ōtsutsuki clan's] new home and base and using it [post-Great Cataclysm Kyoto] as a base from which to conquer the rest of Japan with, [ Ōtsutsuki clan] conquering the then infant Great Tokyo Empire [Fire Force] in the process.

The  Ōtsutsuki-ruled Kyoto then reunifies Japan under its [ Ōtsutsuki-ruled Kyoto's] leadership and reconquers the post-WW2 lost Japanese provinces of Karufuto [Sahalkin and the Kurils], Chousen [Korean peninsula] and Formosa [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands]. The  Ōtsutsuki clan, after restoring Manchuko and the Aisin-Gioro House in Manchuria, the Mongol United Autonomous Federation and the Genghis Khan-descended House of Borjjin in Inner Mongolia, the Ming dynasty and the Imperial House of Zhu in Han China in the form of a neo-Beiyang Government ruled neo-Yuan Shikai formed Empire of China, the Ottoman Empire and the House of Osman in East Turkestan, the Empire of Vietnam and the Ngyuen dynasty in Vietnam, the Kingdom of Laos and the Khun Lo dynasty in Laos and the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian East Coast, [the  Ōtsutsuki clan] turns its [the  Ōtsutsuki clan's] attention to reconquering its [the  Ōtsutsuki clan's] first imperial realm [the Elemental Nations] and [the  Ōtsutsuki clan's] homeland [the Elemental Nations] succeeding in doing so. The  Ōtsutsuki clan abolishes the Elemental Nations' shinobi system and replaces it with the Armed Detective [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] system, doing this [implementing the Armed Detective system] across all its [the  Ōtsutsuki clan's] imperial territories. As a result the Hero system [My Hero Academia] never comes to be as the Meta Liberation Army [My Hero Academia], the Quirk-supremacist group being the Hero system in canon My Hero Academia, [the Meta Liberation Army] is wiped out by the neo-Japanese Empire's forces and the white-haired, red-eyed, tall and slender but also muscular, reserved and soft spoken but also determined, cunning and slick immortal Quirk user with the ability to steal, copy and even give other QuriksMidoriya Hiashi [My Hero Academia], better known by his [Hiashi's] underworld alias All for One [My Hero Academia], [Hiashi] quits the VIllian [My Hero Academia] lifestyle full-time and [Hiashi] instead uses his resources, power and underworld strength to support the neo-Japanese Empire and its progressive ideology. With  no Hero system in place for the Meta Liberation Army and its [the MLA's] devotees to hide behind, there is no All Might to hunt down and chase Hiashi and so Hiashi is [Hiashi] able to spend time with his [Hiashi's] current wife, the green-haired, green-eyed, short, slender and petite, but also plump, curvy and rather buxom kind and loving but also sharp and determined Midoriya Inko nee Shimura, who [Inko] like in canon My Hero Academia, [Inko] has no idea of her [Inko's] husband's [Hiashi's] real occupation [villanry] and his [Hiashi's] legitimate son and [Hiashi's] heir, My Hero Academia's protagonist Midoriya Izuku, who [Izuku] has no idea what his [Izuku's] dad [Hiashi] once did for a living. The story should focus on Hiashi quitting the villian lifestyle after [Hiashi] seeing the Meta Liberation Army's annhilation and realizing that \\"All for One\\" will no longer be needed to rule the underworld from the shadows as a foil [\\"All for One\\"] to the Meta Liberation Army, showing how he [Hiashi] gave up the fake last name of Shiguarki he [Hiashi] used while [Hiashi] ruling the Japanese Underworld as \\"All for One\\" and [Hiashi] returning to his [Hiashi's] true name [Midoriya Hiashi], [Hiashi] adjusting to be a civilian once more and [Hiashi] washing his [Hiashi's] illegally gained trillions through [Hiashi] the disguise as a legitimate buisness tycoon and how he [Hiashi] meets Inko and why she [Inko] falls in love with him [Hiashi] and how he [Hiashi] falls in love with her [Inko], [Hiashi and Inko falling in love with each other |Hiashi and Inko] .P.S: There is no multiverse, multiple worlds, alternative worlds or alternate universes in this story.

In his hand, he absentmindedly toyed with a simple black band, turning it as his thoughts turned to the new life he had crafted.\\"Who would have thought?\\" Hiashi mused, speaking to the sole occupant of the room, Kenji Takahashi, his most trusted confidant and former lieutenant of the underground. Kenji leaned against an ornate bookshelf, his gaze fixed on Hiashi. \\"The fall of the Meta Liberation Army would leave such... emptiness.\\"Kenji nodded. \\"It’s ironic, isn't it? 'All for One,' the terror of the shadows, now basking in the light of peace. But,\\" Kenji said, the corners of his mouth lifting, \\"that peace is fragile, held together by the might of the Ōtsutsuki clan and their incredible mastery over powers seen in myth and legend.\\"Hiashi allowed himself a small smile at that. \\"Yes, the Ōtsutsuki have reshaped this world. No longer are the shinobi the harbingers of balance — it is the armed detectives, with honor and law, backed by the Jurai Empire's technology and the unions with other restored houses such as the Ming and the Ottomans. It's a new era of prosperity.\\"\\"And it has brought you prosperity as well, Hiashi-san,\\" Kenji remarked, \\"but let us not forget why we are here today. You have a new life now — one with Inko and young Izuku. Shall we plan for the wedding?\\"\\"Yes, the wedding,\\" Hiashi echoed, as if waking from a dream. \\"I have left 'All for One' behind. Inko knows nothing of the underworld, of quirks that can crush cities. To her, I am but Hiashi, the business tycoon with fortuitous investments.\\"\\"They do not need to learn of your past, Hiashi-san. That chapter is closed,\\" Kenji assured him.\\"And in cutting ties with 'All for One,' I have not only gained Inko's love but also found something... unexpected,\\" Hiashi said, his voice softening. \\"Hope. In my once endless pursuit of power, I had discarded it. Yet now, looking into Inko's eyes, feeling the untainted admiration of Izuku, I am reminded of what it means to be truly human.\\"Kenji's face bore a look of understanding. Drawing closer, he shared a rare moment of vulnerability. \\"We've both walked dark paths, my friend. But now, we hold power enough to protect and foster this new world. Blending into the fabric of society, we wield our influence for peace, for the betterment of all.\\"Hiashi nodded, his eyes firm with resolve. \\"Inko will never know of 'All for One.' Izuku will grow, perhaps unaware of the legacy he could have inherited, but he will be free — free to live a life unburdened by the strife that shadowed us. Ours will be a family not of villains, but of legitimate honor.\\"\\"May fortune smile upon you and your family, Hiashi,\\" Kenji bowed slightly, a sign of profound respect.Rising from his chair, Hiashi clasped Kenji's shoulder. \\"And to us all, Kenji. We have been given a second chance — let us ensure it will not be wasted. The Ōtsutsuki's empire, built upon ancient power and modern steel, will be our support, and we shall be its unseen guardians — unseen, yet ever present.\\"As they stood together, two architects of the underworld now sheathed in the guise of civility, a future unfurled before them — a future of light, love, and the possibility of redemption."},{"question":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artDesert Rose","answer":"\\"Desert Rose | Vibrant Nature-Inspired Art for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts | Unique Home Decor & Fashion Statement | Gift Idea\\""},{"question":"当前时间:2024/4/22 16:47:46优惠id:2102024040378239\\r鄂尔多斯蒙商借记卡观影满30立减20（东胜、伊旗、康巴什）\\r一、活动时间：2024年04月05日-2024年12月31日 每周五09:00:00-23:59:59二、活动对象：蒙商银行借记卡用户卡种类：蒙商银行借记卡用户（卡bin：62176008；62233602；62233632；62176009；62233688；62233632；62176003；62176005；62176032；62359232）三、活动范围：鄂尔多斯市鄂尔多斯东胜、伊旗、康巴什指定电影院四、活动内容：客户通过云闪付绑定蒙商指定银行借记卡，每周五09:00:00-23:59:59通过“云影票”购买电影票，可享受满30元立减20元优惠。鄂尔多斯蒙商借记卡观影满30立减20（达旗）、（东胜、伊旗、康巴什）、（准旗）三个活动名额共享，单用户单月限享受其中1次优惠，活动名额有限，先到先得。五、活动细则：1.符合同一设备、同一注册手机号、同一银行卡预留手机号、同一银行实体卡号、同一身份证号或者同一APP账号等任一条件的，均视为同一用户。用户需使用本人的电子设备、APP账号、银行卡等亲自参加。2.优惠使用默认优先级为：立减/票券&gt;积分&gt;红包，您可前往“我的”-“设置”-“支付设置”-“付款码优惠使用顺序”进行设置。若优惠方式与设置的付款码优惠使用顺序不同，可能无法享受指定活动的优惠。3.用户支付时，如通过输入银行卡号等信息完成支付的，无法参与优惠活动。4.享受优惠的交易如发生退货、撤销等反向交易，则视为用户放弃优惠，订单实际支付金额退回至用户原付款卡。该次优惠次数视为已使用。5.由于用户电子设备不支持、设备处于脱机状态、未打开手机定位功能、APP未更新到最新版本、卡片挂失、换卡等自身原因导致无法享受优惠的，该优惠次数后续不予补发。6.本活动发放的优惠和权益仅限用户本人使用，如用户以不正当方式获取或使用优惠（包括但不限于修改用户定位、使用外挂工具、与商户进行虚假交易等），中国银联和商户有权取消用户参与资格、撤销相关交易、收回优惠权益（含已使用及未使用的）、冻结用户账号，并拒绝该自然人用户今后参加银联的任何优惠活动。7.本次活动所有时间点以中国银联后台系统时间（北京时间）为准。如出现不可抗力或情势变更等情况（如重大灾害事件、受有权机关指令需停止或调整的、系统故障需暂停的、活动中存在违规作弊行为损害消费者权益的），在法律许可的范围内，银联保留调整、暂停和终止本活动的权利，并经公告后生效。8.用户参与活动即视为理解并同意本活动细则。如对商户积分、会员卡、商品、商户发起的其他活动有疑问，请咨询活动商户。9.由于网络可能存在迟延，云闪付APP活动展示券上显示的剩余名额仅供参考。\\r蒙商银行借记卡卡号开头：62176008;62233602;62233632;62176009;62233688;62233632;62176003;62176005;62176032;6235923\\r鄂尔多斯蒙商借记卡观影满30立减20（达旗）、（东胜、伊旗、康巴什）、（准旗）三个活动名额共享，单用户单月限享受其中1次优惠\\r东胜、伊旗、康巴什指定电影院","answer":"\`\`\`json{  \\"coupon_id\\": \\"2102024040378239\\",  \\"time\\": \\"2024-4-5 ~ 2024-12-31 每周五9点开始\\",  \\"days\\": 39,  \\"platform\\": \\"云闪付App\\",  \\"payway\\": \\"被扫\\",  \\"bank\\": \\"蒙商银行\\",  \\"card_type\\": \\"借记卡\\",  \\"area\\": \\"鄂尔多斯东胜、伊旗、康巴什\\",  \\"shops\\": \\"指定电影院\\",  \\"bins\\": \\"62176008、62233602、62233632、62176009、62233688、62233632、62176003、62176005、62176032、62359232\\",  \\"coupons\\": \\"满30立减20\\",  \\"daily\\": 0,  \\"weekly\\": 0,  \\"monthly\\": 1,  \\"total\\": 9,  \\"scene\\": \\"影票\\",  \\"state\\": 1}\`\`\`"},{"question":"Write an academic, formal, and polite email to Professor Maimone and explain to her that not being able to obtain Graduate Assistantship (GA) caused setbacks on my path of continuing  MASLA program in the TESOL track at MSU and more importantly miss the opportunity of learning from your expertise and knowledge.

Dans certains cas, la gastronomie locale a pu être un facteur de développement, en particulier lorsqu’elle a su créer de véritables districts gastronomiques comme dans le cas de la région lyonnaise (Bonnard, 2011) ou lorsqu’une “rénovation” gastronomique s’est appuyée sur des spécificités locales de ressources, voire les a développées comme dans le cas emblématique de Michel Bras (Etcheverria, 2011a et b ; Marcilhac, 2011 ; Guichard-Anguis, 2011). En revanche, dans d’autres cas, hier mais aussi aujourd’hui, l’expansion du marché gastronomique se fait sans effets d’entraînement locaux particuliers (en dehors des effets habituels de dépenses de revenus liés à l’offre gastronomique), notamment en matière de promotion des produits locaux. Il en est ainsi pour une grande partie de la gastronomie “élitiste” (les “étoilés Michelin”), en France comme en Italie ou en Grande-Bretagne, même si des inflexions voient désormais le jour. Cette diversité, dans le temps et dans l’espace, des relations entre gastronomie et territoire s’observe aussi dans des domaines proches, comme en matière d’agrotourisme, d’œnotourisme et de promotion des produits agricoles et vitivinicoles de terroir (Gatelier, Delaplace et Pichery, 2012). De telles constatations suggèrent que divers types de liens puissent exister et qu’ils dépendent principalement du type même de développement de la gastronomie considérée. L’analyse de l’évolution des gastronomies montre en effet que ces développements sont loin de suivre une dynamique commune et qu’il est nécessaire de réintroduire leurs spécificités. Il en est ainsi quand on compare l’évolution des gastronomies fondées sur des districts gastronomiques et de celles qui ne le sont pas ou de celles qui sont fondées sur des patrimoines gastronomiques différents, comme la gastronomie française et la gastronomie italienne (Barrère, Buzio, Mariotti, Corsi et Borrione, 2012).2Il n’est alors pas possible de poser directement la question de la relation en général entre développement gastronomique et développement local sauf à assumer le risque de ne pouvoir dépasser les monographies : comment telle gastronomie et tel développement gastronomique ont-ils joué sur le développement de telle région ? Pour tenter de dépasser ces limites, il convient dans un premier temps de construire un cadre théorique suffisant pour analyser le développement gastronomique, voire en dresser des typologies, de façon à pouvoir, dans un second temps, lier formes de développement gastronomique et effets sur le développement des territoires. Le texte ci-après s’inscrit dans le premier type de tâche, l’appréhension des types de développement gastronomique, même s’il propose une esquisse (et une esquisse seulement) de l’effet de la gastronomie française sur les territoires. Pour cela, il propose, dans un premier temps, les bases d’un cadre d’analyse du développement gastronomique en liant les tendances de développement d’une gastronomie au modèle qui la structure et au patrimoine gastronomique qui l’englobe. Il enrichit ensuite ce cadre en l’appliquant, dans un second temps, au développement de la gastronomie française par l’étude du patrimoine gastronomique français dans ses diverses composantes, élitiste et non élitiste. Il poursuit en proposant un début d’analyse des effets d’entraînement sur les territoires du système gastronomique français et de son patrimoine. Dans un quatrième temps, il montre enfin leurs limites, compte tenu de l’épuisement relatif du modèle élitiste qui les domine, et conclut en soulevant la question de la relève possible par les composantes non élitistes, régionales et locales, du patrimoine gastronomique français, susceptibles de poser en termes nouveaux le problème de la relation développement gastronomique - développement local.Un cadre analytique pour penser le développement gastronomique3La constatation de la régularité dans le temps et l’espace de pratiques alimentaires définies et particulières a conduit Lévi-Strauss à analyser le caractère culturel de ces pratiques qui pouvaient sembler “naturelles” en reliant “naturellement” des individus ou des groupes aux ressources disponibles localement. Ce travail fondateur a ouvert la voie à l’analyse de la cuisine comme “fait social total”, selon la formule de Mauss. Fischler (1990) identifie des “cultures culinaires”, ensembles plus ou moins cohérents et durables de principes de choix, de combinaison et de préparation des aliments pour la nutrition. Il définit en outre des “systèmes culinaires”, ensembles de règles culturelles qui organisent ce qu’on peut et ne peut pas manger, les formes sous lesquelles les aliments sont préparés et consommés, les personnes et groupes auxquels sont destinés les aliments… Le système culinaire fixe également les règles d’association des aliments (qui prendront, dans la cuisine classique, la forme de recettes) permettant de créer de la variété à partir de mêmes aliments de base.4En montrant la spécificité du modèle français des trois repas structurés, Poulain (2002) introduit la notion de “modèle alimentaire”, réservant les termes de cuisine et de système culinaire aux règles de préparation des éléments : “Les modèles alimentaires sont des ensembles sociotechniques et symboliques qui articulent un groupe humain à son milieu, fondent son identité et assurent la mise en place de processus de différenciation sociale interne. Ils sont un corps de connaissances technologiques, accumulées de génération en génération, permettant de sélectionner des ressources dans un espace naturel, de les préparer pour en faire des aliments, puis des plats, et de les consommer. Mais ils sont en même temps des systèmes de codes symboliques qui mettent en scène les valeurs d’un groupe humain participant à la construction des identités culturelles et aux processus de personnalisation” (Poulain, 2002, p. 25).1 Elle fait ainsi partie des “hedonic products”, biens à utilité essentiellement hédoniste que Addis (...)5La gastronomie ne s’identifie pas à la cuisine ou à l’alimentation. Elle apparaît comme ensemble autonome en se détachant de l’alimentation quand, à telle époque, dans tel lieu et pour tel groupe social, le souci du plaisir l’emporte sur le souci nutritionnel et devient recherché en tant que tel, donc lorsque la cuisine sort du registre de la nécessité pour entrer dans celui du plaisir1. Elle est, elle aussi, structurée comme en témoigne encore récemment la décision de l’Unesco de distinguer “le repas gastronomique des Français” et d’en faire un élément spécifique du patrimoine mondial. Elle l’est d’autant plus que la gastronomie devient une activité professionnelle qui, de ce fait, a besoin de codifier ses règles et d’en assurer l’enseignement et la transmission entre générations.6Chaque cuisine, culture culinaire ou modèle alimentaire n’engendre pas de gastronomie correspondante. Les gastronomies émergent quand certaines conditions sont réunies, culturelles et sociales. Dans le monde oriental, elles sont liées à la puissance des empires et à l’instauration de sociétés de cour ; dans le monde occidental, depuis la Renaissance, se développent également des gastronomies, dont la partie émergente est, elle aussi, liée aux sociétés de cour. On peut alors s’efforcer d’identifier des modèles gastronomiques, entendus comme ensembles, plus ou moins cohérents, de principes, de normes et de règles, s’appliquant au statut de la gastronomie dans la société, à ses règles de composition, de fonctionnement et de transmission-renouvellement. Formellement, nous pouvons distinguer des principes structurels (quels produits sont utilisés, quelle valeur leur est attribuée, qui consomme de la gastronomie, à quelles occasions, sous quelles formes, qui produit la gastronomie, quelle est la configuration du système d’acteurs…) ; des principes de fonctionnement, assurant la régulation de l’ensemble (par exemple, comment sont formés et recrutés les chefs dans les systèmes fondés sur leur hégémonie ou comment est assurée, dans les régimes marchands, l’adaptation entre offre et demande) ; et des principes de développement (la transmission entre générations, le culte du patrimoine, l’incitation ou non à l’innovation...), qui débouchent sur des sentiers d’évolution (course à la sophistication ou à la créativité ou, au contraire, conservatisme culinaire ; flexibilité et degré d’ouverture aux influences extérieures ; capacité à s’exporter hors de son territoire d’origine…) et seront à la base du développement local des gastronomies.7Une gastronomie peut s’organiser autour de plusieurs modèles. Ainsi dans le cas français distinguerons-nous un modèle de gastronomie élitiste et un modèle, très différent, de gastronomie populaire. Dans la mesure où s’établissent des relations entre ces modèles (relations de concurrence, de complémentarité, de domination…), ils participent d’un système gastronomique spécifique (cf. figure 1). Le système gastronomique français s’organise autour de la relation hiérarchisée gastronomie élitiste-gastronomie populaire. De tels systèmes présentent des éléments de cohérence, qui permettront par exemple de distinguer au niveau mondial une gastronomie française, mais cette cohérence est loin d’être parfaite dans la mesure où ils peuvent résulter de fondements hétérogènes (la cuisine de la cour et la cuisine paysanne), où ceux-ci s’influencent les uns les autres, et rencontrent d’autres systèmes, d’autres cultures culinaires et gastronomiques.Agrandir Original (jpeg, 17k)8La reproduction dans le temps des modèles et du système aboutit à la constitution de patrimoines gastronomiques. Les patrimoines gastronomiques (le patrimoine français comme le patrimoine chinois) cristallisent les principes structurels de fonctionnement des systèmes gastronomiques et les transmettent à travers le temps. Ils évoluent, intègrent de nouveaux éléments, en perdent d’autres, en fonction des principes de développement des modèles de base qui les constituent (ainsi le patrimoine français de la gastronomie aristocratique puis élitiste accumule-t-il de plus en plus de recettes dans la mesure où ce modèle pousse à la recherche de nouvelles recettes et à l’innovation technologique), de leurs formes particulières de composition dans un système gastronomique et de leur confrontation à d’autres systèmes (la cuisine française rencontre les cuisines étrangères).9Nous entendrons ces patrimoines comme des ensembles, attachés à des groupes, situés dans le temps et l’espace, exprimant des composantes de leur spécificité et donc de leur identité, ensembles historiquement institués d’avoirs, construits et non construits, transmis par le passé (Barrère, Barthélemy, Nieddu et Vivien, 2004, p. 116), avoirs qui incluent des actifs matériels (des équipements, des locaux…), des actifs immatériels (des savoir-faire, des recettes, des normes, des réputations…) et des institutions (les chambres syndicales, les organismes de formation…). Ils résultent d’une construction et d’une sélection sociale de leurs composantes par des communautés et des individus déterminés (Louis XIV et la reine Victoria joueront un rôle essentiel dans la consécration d’un modèle gastronomique français ou britannique), dans des contextes donnés (ainsi de la domination du puritanisme dans certains pays ou de la philosophie libertine dans d’autres). Ils ont une dimension spatiale par la relation entre patrimoines et communautés, sont liés à des cultures localisées, la dimension locale pouvant fortement varier (dans le cas français, le modèle élitiste impose une dimension nationale tandis que subsistent des patrimoines régionaux ou locaux). Ils se reproduisent par un processus de transmission culturelle, par exemple via la conservation des traditions artisanales et la transmission des savoir-faire professionnels ou par une transmission mère-fille au sein des familles. Cependant, comme les systèmes gastronomiques dont ils proviennent, ces patrimoines, soumis à la rencontre d’autres patrimoines et d’autres cultures, dont des cultures culinaires, ne constituent pas des ensembles totalement cohérents, même si certaines caractéristiques fortes les marquent, et ils ne se reproduisent pas à l’identique. Ils s’enrichissent (nouvelles recettes, nouvelles techniques) ou s’appauvrissent en se figeant et en étant incapables de s’adapter aux évolutions sociales et culturelles ; ils contribuent, selon les cas, à reproduire le ou les modèles gastronomiques qui sont à leur origine ou, au contraire, s’épuisent progressivement, face aux mutations, selon qu’ils facilitent ou “corsètent” les adaptations nécessaires en réponse à l’évolution de données socio-économiques plus larges (globalisation des économies, émergence de nouveaux pays et de nouveaux groupes sociaux à fort pouvoir d’achat, changements dans les valeurs…).Constitution et structure des modèles et du patrimoine gastronomiques : le cas de la France10Nous nous intéressons au cas de la France, d’une part parce que c’est celui sur lequel existent les études les plus approfondies, d’autre part parce que le patrimoine gastronomique français a eu un rôle international déterminant, de sorte que son avenir est au cœur des mutations actuelles de la gastronomie mondiale. Le système gastronomique français s’est historiquement constitué autour de deux modèles gastronomiques très différents, qu’il a rapprochés et partiellement unifiés, et a produit un très riche patrimoine gastronomique qui s’est largement diffusé à travers le monde.Deux modèles gastronomiques11Les apports des historiens et sociologues de la gastronomie française permettent d’avancer une caractérisation du système gastronomique français à partir de l’existence d’un patrimoine gastronomique français, rassemblant des éléments appartenant à deux modèles gastronomiques assez différents mais qui, vu leur proximité de base spatiale, ont réalisé des échanges et des hybridations. Un modèle élitiste “national” issu de la culture de cour, plutôt dominant, a coexisté pendant des siècles avec un modèle gastronomique “régional” et “populaire”, du fait du processus historique de développement en France de la gastronomie.12La gastronomie française a, en effet, deux sources essentielles. D’un côté, les cuisines locales ont évolué vers des prestations gastronomiques. Sur la base de produits locaux (truffes, poissons, champignons, fromages, vins par exemple), d’une élaboration et d’une sélection locales (confits, garbures, bouillabaisse, cassoulets, tripes, charcuteries…) ont été définies des recettes locales, des plats locaux ou régionaux, pour la cuisine ordinaire mais aussi pour les fêtes et cérémonies (repas de mariage, de communion, fêtes religieuses...). Selon l’importance et la variété des produits locaux plusieurs cultures culinaires émergent (cuisine lyonnaise, alsacienne, du Sud-Ouest…), avec un fort ancrage territorial. Elles privilégient certains produits, définissent des modes de préparation (le confit, les salaisons ou le fumage du saumon), sélectionnent des plats emblématiques (le cassoulet, la bouillabaisse), normalisent des recettes locales. Cette gastronomie populaire, qui a existé dans nombre de pays européens (Breughel peint les fêtes paysannes qui exhibent une pléthore de mets), n’est pas marginale, même si elle est limitée à des occasions et des périodes de temps définies. Les tableaux de Bosch illustrant le jugement dernier comprennent toujours la figure du gourmand, promis à l’enfer, figure que l’on retrouve sur les fresques des églises et monastères du Moyen Âge, témoignant que la “gloutonnerie” n’était pas exceptionnelle et n’était pas réservée aux grands.13D’un autre côté, la société de cour, les cours régionales puis la cour du Roi, ont fait naître puis consacré une cuisine aristocratique dont le but est d’affirmer la puissance des souverains, vis-à-vis des humbles d’un côté et des autres puissants et concurrents de l’autre. La concurrence entre pouvoirs locaux puis le besoin de consolider la domination du pouvoir royal enclenchent un processus de surenchère qui tend à caractériser de plus en plus la cuisine aristocratique par la sophistication et l’étalage de la richesse. La société du grand siècle de Louis XIV jouera un rôle exceptionnel dans la construction, la normalisation, la légitimation et l’exportation de ce modèle français à travers l’Europe. Celui-ci constitue la base d’un patrimoine gastronomique durable (type de plats, ordonnancement du menu, recettes, type de service, modes de présentation, ornementation de la table, vaisselle, verrerie…) qui évoluera au xixe siècle avec le passage d’un modèle proprement aristocratique à un modèle élitiste, quand les mutations sociales mettront au premier plan de nouveaux groupes sociaux.14La bourgeoisie hésitera entre cuisine populaire et aristocratique et intégrera progressivement pour se distinguer du reste du peuple une version “euphémisée” de la cuisine aristocratique.L’évolution vers un modèle élitiste qui domine le système gastronomique français15Au Moyen Âge, le banquet aristocratique, dans tous les pays, était caractérisé par l’excès. Profusion de plats, de produits rares et riches, gaspillage… Avec la cuisine de cour, le chef devient élément de paraître pour les grands, qui cherchent à les attirer. Pour les épater, le “grand cuisinier” fait appel à sa créativité : nouvelles recettes, nouvelles sauces, nouvelles présentations… Alors que la gastronomie populaire est plutôt conservatrice, la cuisine aristocratique du Grand Siècle glorifie l’invention. Le chef passe du statut d’artisan à celui d’artiste, la cuisine n’est plus une activité matérielle mais une œuvre intellectualisée, esthétisée et formalisée (Parkhurst Ferguson, 2004).16La chute de l’aristocratie avec la Révolution française s’accompagne d’une marchandisation de la cuisine ; les anciens cuisiniers des cercles aristocratiques se reconvertissent en ouvrant des restaurants (il y avait cinquante restaurants en 1789 mais trois mille en 1815). La plupart d’entre eux développèrent une version “euphémisée” de la cuisine aristocratique pour la bourgeoisie moyenne et supérieure, qui fut le vrai vainqueur de la période révolutionnaire, de l’Empire et de la Restauration. Ayant le pouvoir économique et une bonne part du pouvoir politique, elle constitua le noyau des élites dominantes. La cuisine bourgeoise est “euphémisée” car une partie de la bourgeoisie, y compris supérieure, travaille de sorte que la “grande” cuisine reste limitée à des occasions définies, les réceptions, les banquets… à l’intérieur de la “bonne société”.17Brillat-Savarin (1755-1826) et Antonin Carême (1783-1833) furent les principaux acteurs de cette normalisation. Ils créèrent un système cohérent de sauces, soupes, pâtisseries, accompagnements de légumes (Parkhurst Ferguson, 2004, p. 32), rompant avec l’extravagance de la cuisine de cour mais trouvant leur inspiration dans ce patrimoine (Brillat-Savarin, 1848 [paru en 1826]). De même sélectionnèrent-ils au sein des cuisines populaires et régionales les plats et recettes méritant d’être intégrés à la “cuisine française légitime”, en en excluant d’autres, considérés comme “vulgaires” ou “locaux”. Ils contribuèrent ainsi à unifier dans un patrimoine unique, celui de la cuisine française et plus particulièrement de sa gastronomie, les éléments, plus ou moins hétérogènes, provenant des deux modèles précités.18L’association entre base aristocratique et version bourgeoise de la gastronomie française est demeurée le cœur du système gastronomique français, même lorsque les cours impériales de Napoléon Ier et de Napoléon III développèrent, de nouveau, luxe et sophistication. Un tel système est à dominante élitiste, le modèle élitiste apparaissant comme plus valorisé que le modèle populaire et constituant le sommet de la pyramide culinaire. Il s’inscrit dans un paradigme spécifique, élitiste, du goût. L’étude de l’évolution de la mode (Spencer, 1854 ; Veblen, 1899 ; Simmel, 1904 ; Lipovetsky, 1987 ; Barrère et Santagata, 2005) et de la gastronomie (Parkhurst Ferguson, 2004) a montré que le statut social du goût et du luxe est régi par différents paradigmes. Ces paradigmes organisent les questions et réponses relatives au statut et à la définition du goût et des biens de goût, pour une société donnée, à un moment donné. Comment définir le bon goût et le mauvais goût ? Qui les définit (cf. l’image des “arbitres des élégances”) ? Quels biens ou types de biens appartiennent au domaine du luxe ? Quand et comment utiliser les biens de luxe ? Qu’est-ce qui est ordinaire et qu’est-ce qui est extraordinaire, est cuisine ou est gastronomie ?19Le paradigme aristocratique de la société concevait la société comme un ensemble de deux sous-ensembles, deux classes : la noblesse et le peuple. Le paradigme du goût et du luxe aristocratique tournait autour de l’idée que le bon goût est spécifique aux grands et ainsi que les biens de luxe devaient leur être réservés ; le peuple ne saurait les apprécier, ce serait “donner de la confiture aux cochons”. Le vocabulaire du luxe aristocratique exprime encore cette relation : la haute couture, la grande cuisine, les grands vins. Les biens de goût aristocratiques et les biens de goût populaires étaient totalement disjoints et différents, les biens de luxe et les biens ordinaires radicalement séparés, les consommateurs s’“auto-sélectionnaient”. Ce paradigme a historiquement évolué en un paradigme élitiste quand l’ancienne noblesse s’est vue supplantée par la nouvelle bourgeoise d’affaires, les élites intellectuelles et artistiques. L’évolution du modèle gastronomique participe de ce mouvement.20Curnonsky (1872-1956), en écrivant l’énorme somme que constitue La France gastronomique (28 volumes), a définitivement codifié la “grande cuisine” et la “cuisine bourgeoise”. Le Second Empire fut une période d’expansion de nouveaux groupes sociaux appartenant à l’élite, la bourgeoisie industrielle et financière, composée de banquiers, d’industriels, de grands commerçants et d’intermédiaires. Ils étaient riches, cherchaient à se fondre dans la vieille aristocratie, s’intéressaient aux arts et voulaient être distingués du peuple, ainsi que Veblen (1899) les analysera. Un modèle économique du luxe élitiste apparaît alors et renforce la cohérence du modèle de gastronomie élitiste.L’organisation du système gastronomique français21Si la cuisine bourgeoise régnait sur l’ensemble du territoire français, la gastronomie aristocratique, née dans les palais de la cour, était principalement concentrée à Paris. La gastronomie élitiste a maintenu cette localisation qui correspondait aussi à celle des élites françaises, et de plus permettait d’attirer de nombreux touristes étrangers.22La gastronomie élitiste, comme c’était déjà le cas de la cuisine de cour (on se souvient du suicide de Vatel, cuisinier du prince de Condé, en raison du retard de la “marée” venue des côtes normandes), draine vers Paris tous les produits de qualité disponibles sur le territoire français, aidée en cela par la centralisation jacobine des transports (cf. aujourd’hui le rôle du marché national de Rungis où l’on peut trouver tous les produits frais possibles, y compris venant de l’étranger). La chaîne de production est ainsi extrêmement longue. Les produits utilisés doivent être rares, “nobles” (langouste, homard, foie gras, ris de veau, caviar, huîtres, asperges, turbot...), de très grande qualité. Ils sont aussi extrêmement variés du fait de la grande diversité des terroirs et climats propre à la France. Ils sont travaillés par des personnes hautement qualifiées, dans des processus de préparation longs et complexes, en recourant à des techniques et à des appareillages sophistiqués. Le travail est organisé de façon rigoureuse, via une division des tâches précise : la “brigade” avec ses divisions, “sauciers”, “légumiers”, pâtissiers… La cuisine est une activité professionnelle, respectant des normes et routines déterminées, impliquant formation spécifique et longue, souvent à travers le passage dans différents établissements, à la manière du “Tour de France” des compagnons. Le chef est un créateur, avec un statut proche de celui du couturier créateur de la haute couture tout en étant généralement issu d’un apprentissage complet de la hiérarchie culinaire, ce dont il se montre fier en arborant sur sa veste l’insigne de “meilleur ouvrier de France”.23Le grand restaurant constitue le cœur du modèle tout en étant à la pointe de la pyramide gastronomique et occupant sa niche élitiste, diffusant ses innovations vers les segments inférieurs dans une logique top-down. Ses recettes manifestent de la sophistication, de la créativité, sont fortement consommatrices en temps. La vaisselle et la verrerie, les nappes, le décor, le service exhibent leur luxe. Le restaurant offre une profusion de plats, avec un choix large, de multiples accessoires (une cave riche, des cigares, des alcools...). Coûts et prix sont élevés ou très élevés. Le modèle est un modèle d’offre, le cuisinier ne répondant pas à une demande préalable de la clientèle mais définissant le produit offert, qui cherche alors sa clientèle.24La critique gastronomique légitime ce modèle en promouvant les grands chefs et en exigeant d’eux un cadre luxueux. Les conventions culinaires, comme la “nouvelle cuisine” dans les années 1960 ou la “cuisine créative” aujourd’hui, dévalorisent à l’inverse la cuisine bourgeoise et populaire, régionale, “trop lourde”, tout juste bonne à être “revisitée” et “sophistiquée” par les grands chefs. La gastronomie élitiste se distingue clairement de la gastronomie populaire. Le “cuisinier”, le chef, s’oppose à la “cuisinière”, à la “ménagère”, comme le “grand couturier” à la “couturière”. Au lieu de privilégier le produit la gastronomie élitiste esthétise la cuisine et donne de l’importance à l’apprêt et à la présentation du plat. Elle développe l’intellectualisation et la “scientifisation” de la cuisine (Parkhurst Ferguson, 2004). Loin de se contenter de recourir aux recettes et routines traditionnelles, les chefs cherchent à comprendre les “lois” de la cuisine, les processus de transformation des inputs pour les maîtriser et les sophistiquer, les mécanismes du goût.La reproduction du système par le patrimoine25La gastronomie élitiste puise dans le patrimoine français de la cuisine qui intègre différents types d’éléments, issus de la cristallisation, à travers les siècles, de la gastronomie aristocratique et élitiste mais aussi des gastronomies locales et populaires ; elle s’en sert de façon spécifique, différemment des cuisines populaires et locales, en fonction de ses principes structurels et de fonctionnement. Plus précisément, le patrimoine de la cuisine française rassemble des éléments en partie hétérogènes : patrimoines culinaires et patrimoines gastronomiques, patrimoine élitiste et patrimoines locaux (la cuisine niçoise) ou régionaux (la cuisine du Sud-Ouest). Il constitue cependant une certaine unité, par les échanges qui ont pu intervenir entre ses différents composants et par la culture commune dans laquelle ils s’inscrivent. Comme nous l’avons dit, rien n’interdit au grand chef de s’inspirer de recettes ancestrales et locales de même que la ménagère ou le cadre “bobo” peut tenter de réaliser les recettes sophistiquées des grands chefs diffusées par la presse ou sur internet. En même temps, il reflète la domination symbolique de sa composante élitiste.26Ce patrimoine est d’abord un patrimoine de savoir-faire et de création, savoir-faire des cuisiniers professionnels et savoir-faire créatif, source d’avantages comparatifs susceptibles d’attirer une clientèle nationale et internationale. Il l’est via des effets de stock et de mémoire : stocks de recettes et de techniques, que l’on peut utiliser mais aussi “revisiter” ; mémoire des grands cuisiniers d’antan, de leurs pratiques et de leurs discours. Il l’est aussi via des effets d’expérience : les “anciens” transmettent aux plus jeunes via l’apprentissage, le travail en commun ; les participants à la création culinaire peuvent élever leur créativité du fait de leur insertion dans une communauté culturelle qui a réfléchi sur la gastronomie, en connaît l’histoire. Il l’est encore par des effets de district culturel : le patrimoine gastronomique s’inscrit dans une communauté culturelle s’exprimant par un “style” français du luxe ou un “goût” français et bénéficie des créations réalisées dans d’autres domaines. C’est aussi un patrimoine institutionnel, avec des institutions définies, les systèmes d’apprentissage, d’échange entre professionnels, de relations avec la critique gastronomique…27Le patrimoine ne participe pas seulement de la production de biens mais aussi de la production de leurs débouchés. La consolidation et l’extension des débouchés de la gastronomie française se sont appuyées sur un patrimoine de préférences et de goûts, l’existence d’un fonds commun partagé par une communauté qui a appris à lire de façon homogène les divers signes, qui met le même système de signifiants derrière le même système de signes et assure l’homogénéité des représentations, de la relation signifiant-signifié, donc des “goûts” à la fois des offreurs et des demandeurs. Ce patrimoine facilite ainsi, sur un marché de “produits signes”, la rencontre entre offre et demande, rend la gastronomie lisible donc la justifie et la légitime au nom du lien au passé et à l’histoire. Le patrimoine crédibilise la création qui s’y réfère et en élève la réputation.Sentier de développement et effets d’entraînement du patrimoine à dominante élitiste28Le patrimoine à dominante élitiste contribue à la reproduction de la cuisine élitiste le long d’un sentier de développement précis. Son rapport particulier au territoire est alors à la source d’effets particuliers sur le développement territorial.Le sentier de développement29Le patrimoine gastronomique a deux effets importants. En premier lieu, il transmet, en tant que patrimoine territorial partagé, celui de la France, une culture commune d’autant plus forte que les principes de la cuisine et de la gastronomie ont été définis, codifiés, articulés et normalisés (nous avons mentionné le rôle de Carême ou de Curnonsky), puis diffusés (les livres de recettes mais aussi les “manuels d’éducation ménagère”). Il est alors source d’économies de coordination : langage commun, confiance mutuelle, partage de connaissances tacites, circulation aisée de l’information, formes de coopération malgré la concurrence, possibilité dans certaines conditions de favoriser la constitution de districts gastronomiques. En second lieu, il développe des effets d’idiosyncrasie, en permettant à la production française de bénéficier de spécificités d’actifs, engendrées tout au long de l’histoire et sources d’avantages comparatifs décisifs.30Il tend à établir un cercle vertueux créativité-patrimoine :l’histoire de la création culinaire et le culte du créateur, le grand cuisinier, sont des facteurs incitant à la créativité, en la valorisant ;les effets de stock, de mémoire et d’expérience facilitent l’apprentissage et la transmission de la créativité, notamment entre générations ;la patrimonialisation de la cuisine française, et particulièrement de sa gastronomie, la rapproche de l’art et de la création et l’insère dans le patrimoine intellectuel, artistique et culturel français. Cela facilite la transmission des inventions entre disciplines (ainsi, hier le recours à une présentation architecturale des desserts ou aujourd’hui l’invention du design culinaire) et crée une émulation pour la créativité.31La concurrence entre offreurs passe avant tout par la course à la créativité, le renouvellement de la carte et l’investissement dans le cadre du restaurant. Experts et guides, en premier lieu le Guide rouge, justifient ce modèle et disent qui appartient à quel segment, de la niche élitiste des restaurants étoilés et prestigieux aux restaurants standards, en passant par les différents segments définis par des prix et une qualité décroissants mais se référant à des mêmes principes culinaires. Ils contribuent aussi à développer le modèle élitiste et la segmentation correspondante dans les “nouveaux” pays et villes gastronomiques (Espagne, Italie, Japon, Londres, New York, …), où la consommation de gastronomie s’étend rapidement. La course à la créativité, au luxe et aux étoiles peut être illustrée par l’exemple d’Alain Ducasse qui, quand il fut engagé comme chef du Louis XV, à Monte-Carlo, avait d’après son contrat un an pour obtenir la troisième étoile Michelin, faute de quoi celui-ci était automatiquement rompu.32La consommation de masse de gastronomie, sa marchandisation et sa démocratisation ont continué, au moins jusqu’à la fin du siècle dernier, à se faire dans le cadre du modèle élitiste. Le point de référence est resté le grand restaurant et les caractéristiques typiques du vieux modèle aristocratique : un chef célèbre, des produits extra-ordinaires (truffes, caviar, langouste…), des plats sophistiqués, un service de qualité, un décor luxueux et, in fine, une cuisine coûteuse. Ainsi, l’intérêt croissant pour la gastronomie ne s’est pas seulement traduit par une inflation du discours gastronomique. La fréquentation des restaurants gastronomiques s’est fortement élevée bien que les prix pratiqués, absolus et relatifs, aient continué de grimper et soient parfois devenus surréalistes.33Le nombre de restaurants gastronomiques présents dans le Guide Michelin entre 1934 et 2010 et situés à Paris a fortement augmenté au cours de cette période (Barrère, Bonnard et Chossat, 2010) : 193 en 1934, 324 en 1950 et 493 en 2010 ; soit une hausse de 155 % de 1934 à 2010 et de 52 % de 1950 à 2010. Le champ gastronomique s’est étendu en dépit de la hausse, continue et forte, des prix. Les prix moyens des menus et des repas à la carte, observés en euros constants, ont respectivement grimpé de + 245 % et de + 208 % entre 1950 et 2010. Malgré la croissance des prix, la demande de gastronomie n’est plus une demande limitée à un marché étroit mais est devenue une demande de masse.34En son sein, la niche élitiste concernant les prestations de très haut niveau s’est elle aussi étendue bien que ce soient les prix des prestations “les plus sophistiquées” qui augmentent relativement le plus sur la période (les prix à la carte ont plus augmenté que les prix des menus et les prix les plus élevés au départ davantage que les moins élevés), mouvement qui s’accélère encore après 2000. Cette demande émane de personnes financièrement très riches et a donc une élasticité-prix très faible. Comme elles sont présentes dans un nombre croissant de pays et peuvent voyager partout dans le monde, elles sont suffisantes pour alimenter la demande des restaurants superstars (les deux ou trois étoiles Michelin, avec une addition de plus de 200 euros par personne, hors boisson).35Le deuxième type de demande de haute gastronomie, la demande de masse de gastronomie de luxe, s’est lui aussi fortement accru. Ainsi, dans le secteur de la gastronomie comme dans le secteur du luxe, une demande régulière et occasionnelle a donné naissance à une demande de masse (les restaurants sélectionnés par le Guide Michelin en France, qui constituent environ 8 % seulement du nombre de restaurants, peuvent être définis comme “gastronomiques” et représentent néanmoins plus de 8 000 restaurants), demande qui s’adresse à une offre qui est restée organisée sur le modèle du grand restaurant et de la cuisine intellectualisée, formalisée et esthétisée, du modèle élitiste. La croissance de cette demande de haute gastronomie est également attestée par l’observation des comportements des groupes financiers et groupes du luxe qui ont investi dans les restaurants et hôtels. Les palaces parisiens ont recruté des chefs de haut niveau pour gagner des étoiles au Michelin, asseoir leur réputation, accroître ou préserver leur clientèle de touristes.36Le modèle gastronomique élitiste a également attiré les touristes étrangers qui, par la suite, ont constitué, dans leurs pays, une source de demande pour de nouveaux offreurs locaux s’inspirant de cette gastronomie. Le modèle élitiste français s’est ainsi exporté comme s’était déjà exporté dans les cours européennes le modèle aristocratique du Grand Siècle. Cela était d’autant plus faisable que, comme le fait très justement remarquer Parkhurst Ferguson, la cuisine de Carême n’était plus un ensemble de connaissances empiriques mais un savoir scientifique fondé sur un apprentissage technique et professionnel, un système cohérent de principes et de techniques d’application – “Carême’s French cuisine is not tied to or rooted in a particular place” [La cuisine française de Carême n’est pas liée à ni ne prend racine dans un lieu particulier] (Parkhurst Ferguson, 2004, p. 71). En outre, la diminution des coûts de transport, alors que les prix exigibles étaient très élevés, permettait de se procurer l’essentiel des produits rares et nobles, typiques de la cuisine élitiste. Au pire il était possible de remplacer certains produits français par des produits locaux.37Ainsi en Espagne, en Italie, dans les pays nordiques et jusqu’au Royaume-Uni, pourtant jadis réputé pour la médiocrité de sa nourriture et l’absence de réelle gastronomie, se sont développés des restaurants gastronomiques tout à fait comparables aux restaurants français. L’extension du Guide Michelin à ces nouvelles contrées gastronomiques atteste et de la présence de restaurants de grande qualité et de leur insertion dans le modèle de gastronomie élitiste véhiculé par le Michelin.38Cependant les nouveaux pays de gastronomie ont également entrepris de concurrencer la gastronomie française. La course à la créativité et à la sophistication est devenue européenne, voire mondiale quand New York et Tokyo sont devenues de nouvelles capitales gastronomiques. De plus, quand on arrive après les autres, on ne peut se faire de place qu’en se différenciant par la créativité, donc ici l’hyper-créativité.39Le cas de Ferran Adrià, proclamé meilleur cuisinier du monde, est emblématique de ces mutations. Quand il crée un œuf de caille en croûte de caramel, ou une polenta de parmesan, il n’est plus l’utilisateur de recettes ancestrales, mais un créateur – d’odeurs, de textures, de goûts. Avant de fermer définitivement son restaurant pour se consacrer à la création, il le fermait déjà pendant six mois et travaillait avec son équipe dans son “laboratoire” à Barcelone pour inventer de nouvelles recettes en utilisant de nouveaux procédés (cuisine à l’azote liquide, centrifugation, etc.) et des textures nouvelles (gélatines, sucettes, mousses ultra-aérées montées au siphon). Il exaltait la dimension sémiotique de sa cuisine en présentant ses plats comme des “tableaux” ; le dîner durait quatre heures et demie avec une succession, dans le cadre d’un menu unique, de trente tableaux. La créativité était mise en avant, Ferran Adrià revendiquant 1 500 créations estampillées, dont l’œuf de caille caramélisé, l’huître servie en écume d’eau de mer, le caviar servi sur une gelée de pomme, la gaufrette de parmesan surmontée d’une boule de glace au parmesan, ou les lamelles de champignon dégustées crues après avoir humé dans un carton leurs odeurs de sous-bois et ingéré une pipette de suc de cèpes. Cela lui a permis d’être considéré, y compris par nombre de chefs français, comme “le meilleur cuisinier sur la planète” (dixit Joël Robuchon). Les “consommateurs” l’ont également plébiscité : 400 000 demandes de réservation pour 8 000 places (le restaurant n’étant ouvert que le soir et pour 45 couverts).La dimension territoriale du système gastronomique français40Le caractère scientifique et abstrait de la construction gastronomique française permettait, comme le faisait remarquer Parkhurst Ferguson, l’exportation de son modèle élitiste, mais impliquait en même temps une “déterritorialisation” de celui-ci en tant que processus culinaire. Cela implique-t-il pour autant que le système gastronomique français n’ait aucun rapport particulier au territoire, ce qui contredirait l’observation statistique de la concentration des restaurants dans certaines zones ? Absolument pas, car, pour traiter de sa dimension territoriale, il convient de tenir compte de la transformation du système gastronomique en système marchand et de l’approfondissement progressif de cette dimension marchande. Or celle-ci introduit une contrainte essentielle de rentabilité. Il ne suffit plus de “faire de la cuisine” pour les grands ou l’élite, il faut la vendre. Se pose donc la question nouvelle des débouchés et de leur inscription territoriale. La contrainte des débouchés est d’autant plus forte pour le système gastronomique français que celui-ci se fonde sur un modèle élitiste de cuisine coûteuse, dont la rentabilité marchande est problématique et dépend étroitement des débouchés. Il en est résulté que, loin de dépendre de la proximité de ressources spécifiques en termes d’inputs productifs, c’est la localisation de la clientèle qui a été le facteur dominant de localisation des restaurants en France. L’accroissement de la concurrence entre établissements a renforcé l’impératif de localisation à proximité des bassins de clientèle et l’a d’autant plus renforcé qu’elle entraînait une course au luxe synonyme d’investissements coûteux et donc de nouveaux problèmes de rentabilité. Et comme le processus culinaire élitiste était, comme nous l’avons dit, “déterritorialisé”, c’est la contrainte de débouchés qui détermine la localisation des établissements gastronomiques. Une partie de la gastronomie française a cependant noué des relations plus complexes avec son environnement en y intégrant la question de son approvisionnement.41La gastronomie parisienne a profité à plein de la centralisation française pour renforcer ses débouchés et assurer son expansion. Une continuité territoriale s’est ainsi affirmée entre gastronomie de cour, créée et développée autour des palais de la région parisienne, et gastronomie élitiste et marchande, qui s’appuie sur une clientèle concentrée dans la capitale. À la clientèle locale des élites financières et culturelles se joint l’importante clientèle des touristes qui ont fait de Paris la première destination touristique mondiale. L’accès à la gastronomie élitiste, régulièrement ou occasionnellement, des classes moyennes, et leur accès plus large aux segments inférieurs et moyens de la gastronomie qui ont “euphémisé” la cuisine de la niche élitiste (cf. supra) ont renforcé l’avantage de la gastronomie parisienne lié à la concentration de revenus médians et élevés dans la région parisienne, permis son expansion et reproduit sa domination. Paris, qui ne comptait que 3,6 % de la population française en 2010, concentrait ainsi 38,5 % des trois-étoiles Michelin, 15,5 % des deux-étoiles et 10,9 % des une-étoile.2 La localisation par effet de clientèle est merveilleusement illustrée par la dernière édition du Gu (...)42Les cuisines élitistes situées hors de la région parisienne ont, elles aussi, été confrontées à l’épineuse question des débouchés. Une cuisine aussi coûteuse ne peut survivre qu’en pratiquant des prix élevés mais en réussissant néanmoins à obtenir des taux de remplissage suffisants. La localisation a donc suivi celle de la clientèle. L’échec de Pierre Gagnaire à Saint-Étienne, incapable d’y obtenir un équilibre financier, faute de “bassin de clientèle” suffisant, et son succès peu après à Paris, avec la même cuisine, est tout à fait symbolique. L’évolution de la localisation de la clientèle s’est traduite par l’expansion des restaurants de la Côte d’Azur et, plus largement, des zones à tourisme de luxe. La région Paca (Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur), avec 7,8 % de la population française (chiffre 2010), concentre pour sa part 7,7 % des trois-étoiles, 17,9 % des deux-étoiles et 14,6 % des une-étoile2. Inversement, l’ancienne route des vacances que constituait la nationale 7 et le long de laquelle s’égrenaient les restaurants gastronomiques, dépouillée d’une partie de ses clients par l’expansion des autoroutes, a perdu de son lustre.43Quand la clientèle locale potentielle ne pouvait suffire à assurer l’équilibre financier des restaurants gastronomiques, il a donc fallu s’efforcer d’attirer de la clientèle, notamment touristique. Pour cela il convenait de justifier le détour ainsi occasionné. Il est d’ailleurs cocasse de constater que les références élitistes du Michelin, les deux et trois-étoiles qui s’adressent à la niche élitiste, se présentent précisément comme des justifications de détours (le deux-étoiles “mérite le détour” et le trois-étoiles “mérite le voyage”).44Attirer une clientèle qui ne se trouvait pas sur place et composer ainsi avec le principe dominant d’une localisation dictée par la clientèle impliquait alors de jouer sur les spécificités de la localisation réelle du restaurant. Ainsi les cuisines élitistes situées en région ont-elles été amenées à cultiver leur spécificité territoriale en jouant de leur proximité avec des actifs locaux spécifiques. Elles ont puisé dans les composantes non élitistes, bourgeoises ou populaires et d’origine régionale ou locale, du patrimoine gastronomique français. Avant que la clientèle à fort pouvoir d’achat n’ait massivement investi la Côte d’Azur, celle-ci a commencé à vanter la cuisine méditerranéenne, progressivement “redécouverte” voire “réinventée”. La région lyonnaise, qui, sur la base d’une cuisine régionale affirmée, avait réussi à constituer un véritable district gastronomique (Bonnard, 2011), unissant cuisine élitiste et cuisine bourgeoise régionale, intégrant une cuisine résolument populaire quitte à la revisiter (les bouchons), a souvent représenté un modèle de solution. Néanmoins la contrainte de clientèle n’a pas permis d’obtenir une croissance aussi forte que celle qu’ont connue les régions, Paris en premier lieu, dotées de débouchés plus affirmés.45La contrainte de débouchés, particulièrement forte pour sa dominante élitiste, et son caractère de cuisine déterritorialisée ont a contrario stimulé l’expansion internationale de la cuisine française. Les plus grands chefs ont été amenés à s’investir sur les marchés gastronomiques extérieurs en multipliant leurs implantations dans les grands bassins de demande gastronomique, les grandes métropoles mondiales, et en y réussissant grâce à leur réputation et à celle de la cuisine française. Obligés d’accorder leur cuisine traditionnelle avec les spécificités des goûts locaux, ils ont en même temps élargi leur palette de connaissances des goûts et saveurs, rencontré de nouveaux produits de qualité, et les ont intégrés dans leurs cuisines, y compris en France, accroissant par là même leur caractère déterritorialisé.Les effets sur le développement territorial46Il s’agit là d’une question difficile parce que les (rares) études qui l’ont affrontée sont surtout constituées de monographies, qui rendent difficile un jugement d’ensemble. Les statistiques disponibles sont elles-mêmes peu développées et de médiocre qualité. On ne pourra donc que se limiter à repérer les principaux types d’effets résultant du double processus que nous avons précédemment relevé : déterritorialisation du processus culinaire, territorialisation des débouchés via les bassins de clientèle.La course aux bassins de clientèle47Nous avons vu plus haut comment la recherche de débouchés auprès d’une clientèle capable de consacrer des budgets accrus aux dépenses de restauration gastronomique, du fait de l’inflation de ses prix, conduisait à une restructuration spatiale de la cuisine élitiste. L’ensemble des deux régions Île-de-France et Paca concentre aujourd’hui plus de 30 % des restaurants étoilés, et le phénomène est encore plus marqué pour sa niche élitiste, plus de 46 % des trois-étoiles et 34,5 % des deux-étoiles. Avec les inflexions de la localisation se modifient aussi les flux de revenus créés localement et les créations d’emplois.48La recherche de débouchés par la gastronomie la conduit à s’adresser aux touristes, nationaux mais surtout étrangers. Ce faisant, elle accroît aussi l’attractivité du territoire. Curnonsky cherchait, dès la fin de la Grande Guerre, à asseoir un cercle vertueux entre développement du tourisme et essor de la gastronomie, sur la base d’une valorisation du patrimoine culinaire français. La gastronomie française, qu’elle soit offerte par les restaurants de la niche élitiste, par ceux du luxe accessible ou par ceux qui s’inscrivent dans une gastronomie populaire et régionale, est un élément collectif important d’attrait touristique. Sa réputation est particulièrement consolidée par celle des grandes tables de la gastronomie élitiste, par effet d’image, même si la plupart des touristes n’y ont pas accès, mais elle est également soutenue par la réputation de l’ensemble des autres restaurants, de telle sorte que la France apparaît comme un, voire le “pays où l’on mange bien”. Cet effet concerne l’ensemble du territoire français et contribue à ce que la France apparaisse comme la première destination touristique au monde.49L’effet d’attirance globale se manifeste différemment selon les spécificités des territoires qui composent la nation, en fonction de l’importance des patrimoines gastronomiques locaux et de l’implantation des différents types d’établissements de restauration. Curnonsky visait déjà à faire de Lyon, et non de Paris, la capitale gastronomique du monde !50La niche élitiste constitue un point d’attraction essentiel. Elle s’adresse, compte tenu des prix pratiqués, à un segment très particulier de la demande gastronomique. Néanmoins ce segment, du fait de la mondialisation, du développement du tourisme international et de la diminution des coûts de transport, rassemble une clientèle quantitativement non négligeable et détentrice d’un pouvoir d’achat élevé qui participe aux revenus du tourisme. Ainsi, en dehors de l’effet général d’image dont bénéficie l’ensemble du territoire, cette niche élitiste produit des effets dérivés sur la consommation touristique, effets qui se concentrent avant tout sur Paris et, dans des conditions différentes, sur la Côte d’Azur. Elle contribue par là même à orienter le développement touristique. Les groupes financiers du luxe investissent dans les restaurants et hôtels. Les palaces parisiens, comme ceux de la Côte, recrutent des chefs de haut niveau pour gagner des étoiles au Michelin, asseoir leur réputation, accroître ou préserver leur clientèle de touristes. Les chefs eux-mêmes, confrontés au coût exorbitant de la cuisine élitiste, cherchent à attirer les touristes et à rentabiliser leur cuisine par des prestations plus lucratives, adjoignent à leur restaurant de luxueuses chambres ou exercent directement leur talent dans les hôtels de luxe (comme propriétaires, copropriétaires ou simplement chefs). Dans certains cas la recherche de l’effet d’image susceptible d’attirer une clientèle ou de promouvoir l’image d’une région conduit les acteurs locaux, privés et publics, à soutenir les efforts des restaurateurs pour faire émerger des établissements de prestige, à réputation internationale. Les maisons de Champagne, par exemple, ont besoin que leurs clients, clients finaux ou négociants intermédiaires, puissent trouver en Champagne une restauration de qualité et développent des coopérations avec les établissements locaux haut de gamme. En outre, les effets sur le tourisme débordent du territoire national dans la mesure où la gastronomie élitiste française part à la recherche de nouveaux clients (locaux mais aussi touristes de passage) hors de son territoire d’origine, en ouvrant des restaurants dans toutes les grandes métropoles mondiales. Un autre effet dérivé est le développement des guides gastronomiques et particulièrement du Guide rouge (le “Michelin”), qui constitue un faire-valoir du modèle élitiste français.51Les restaurants de luxe accessibles et ceux de gastronomie populaire et régionale, offrant de la cuisine “bourgeoise” soignée, créent eux aussi des effets positifs pour le développement du tourisme. En particulier quand ils représentent une masse critique repérable, par leur agglomération dans certains territoires (la région lyonnaise ou le Périgord) ou le long de certains axes de communication, comme l’a été longtemps la nationale 7.52L’expansion de la gastronomie française, portée par sa réputation nationale et internationale, par l’enrichissement d’une partie de la population mondiale et par le souci grandissant de satisfaction hédonistique, a des effets macro-économiques importants, en créant des emplois et en distribuant des revenus qui contribuent à soutenir la croissance. Son incidence sur le tourisme est également sensible en matière de balance des paiements. Il faut enfin noter que le modèle élitiste a permis le développement en France d’un secteur des arts de la table à forte réputation internationale, proposant des produits de grande qualité qui unissent une dimension artisanale ou industrielle à une forte dimension artistique (Baccarat, Lalique, Christofle…).Des effets contrastés sur la territorialisation des inputs53Le modèle élitiste français est, on l’a vu, fondé sur un savoir scientifique et sur une compétence professionnelle et non sur la spécificité de ressources locales. La concentration de restaurants élitistes à Paris ou sur la Côte d’Azur n’a rien à voir avec l’origine locale des produits privilégiés par la “grande” cuisine française : lièvre, homard, huîtres, caviar, épices… La cuisine parisienne n’est pas issue d’un terroir agricole ou viticole, elle ne privilégie pas les asperges d’Argenteuil, le ginglet de Pontoise ou le vin de Montmartre. La cuisine élitiste s’approvisionne dans l’ensemble du territoire, voire à l’étranger. La concurrence entre établissements pousse à soigner la qualité des matières premières et la sélection des producteurs. Certains terroirs seront donc privilégiés mais leur localisation n’a rien à voir avec celle des établissements de restauration. Elle passe par l’interface des marchés et des réseaux d’intermédiaires, capables aujourd’hui de livrer n’importe quel produit en n’importe quel point du territoire. Le souci de qualité permet cependant à certains terroirs de survivre et à des productions artisanales de se maintenir en élevant la qualité de leur offre, et en contrant ainsi les fournisseurs qui standardisent leur production pour bénéficier d’économies d’échelle leur permettant de diminuer leurs prix.54Le modèle élitiste n’est pas un modèle économe. Il cuisine des produits rares dont il n’utilise que les parties ou composants nobles et gaspille ainsi des matières premières. Les faisant venir de tous les coins de France et du monde, il engendre des coûts de transport donc des coûts environnementaux élevés.3 Elle affirme que 55 % des matières premières utilisées dans son restaurant phare sont issues de Bou (...)55Les cuisines régionales qui ont développé des segments élitistes, comme la gastronomie lyonnaise ou bordelaise, cherchent de leur côté à préserver voire à développer des spécificités locales afin de pouvoir attirer localement une clientèle, et de justifier, notamment pour les touristes, de se détourner de la seule région parisienne : vins régionaux, poissons locaux (la lamproie, l’alose, l’omble chevalier), grenouilles des Dombes, charcuteries locales, asperges des Landes, chapons et canards du Sud-Ouest ou de Bresse, palombes… Les restaurateurs sont alors conduits à nouer des rapports qui dépassent le recours aux grands marchés d’intérêt national. Ils ont besoin d’un approvisionnement régulier et garanti. Ils incitent les fournisseurs à monter en qualité afin de pouvoir offrir, à leur tour, des prestations de qualité. En place de transactions marchandes standards et anonymes avec leurs fournisseurs, ils développent des relations marchandes personnalisées qui intègrent des exigences de qualité, de naturel, d’authenticité, sont fondées sur le voisinage et le partage de valeurs communes, et aboutissent à former des réseaux. Ainsi le restaurant mettra-t-il en valeur ses fournisseurs en publiant leurs noms ou en écoulant certains de leurs produits (des confitures, du miel, des moutardes, des foies gras, des objets de table…). Dominique Loiseau3 ou Olivier Roellinger multiplient les partenariats avec des producteurs locaux, qui les fournissent mais qu’ils peuvent aider à élever leur qualité ou à créer de nouveaux produits ou de nouvelles variétés grâce à leur expertise et à leur créativité. Ces relations peuvent aller jusqu’à des formes d’intégration quasi salariale. Laurent Tarridec, quand il travaillait aux Mouscardins, deux-étoiles à Saint-Tropez, devant la difficulté à obtenir un approvisionnement local régulier, avait décidé de salarier l’un des pêcheurs du port. Ces cuisines élitistes régionales jouent ainsi la carte du retour au terroir et des circuits courts, s’efforçant d’utiliser leur localisation et leur spécialisation culinaire pour surfer sur la vague des nouvelles valeurs de culte de la nature et de respect de l’environnement. Cependant le culte du naturel, dans le contexte de la montée des valeurs écologiques, conduit l’ensemble du secteur à limiter et à contrôler son recours au marché. Ainsi plusieurs grands chefs parisiens suivent-ils l’exemple emblématique d’Alain Passard, en créant leurs propres potagers pour aboutir à une quasi-intégration de certains approvisionnements.56Les restaurants gastronomiques de gamme inférieure, qui développent des offres inspirées des cuisines populaires et régionales, jouent dans un contexte concurrentiel tendu par la montée des coûts. Ils sont donc pris entre deux tendances contradictoires. D’un côté, s’adresser aux grands réseaux commerciaux d’approvisionnement pour bénéficier de la standardisation et des baisses de prix. De l’autre, privilégier leurs spécificités locales et leur connaissance des réseaux de producteurs de qualité pour, comme les restaurants du segment supérieur, valoriser la “typicité” de leurs prestations par l’utilisation de “produits authentiques” et la constitution de réseaux personnels de petits fournisseurs. Il en est également ainsi pour les vins avec la recherche systématique du “petit producteur”, censé apporter un produit authentique et sain et avoir été découvert par le chef, ce qui, compte tenu de la concurrence et du nombre croissant de restaurants, lui donne un caractère de plus en plus mythique. Ce mouvement s’accélère aujourd’hui en s’appuyant sur la demande croissante de “vrai”, de “naturel”, de “proche”, formulée par les consommateurs ou qui leur est attribuée.57Les restaurants gastronomiques représentent évidemment un débouché direct pour les producteurs vitivinicoles tout en contribuant à asseoir la réputation de leurs vins et alcools. Comme les restaurants attirent une partie de leur clientèle par la qualité de leur offre en ce domaine, des synergies existent entre gastronomie et production vitivinicole. Les restaurants, y compris ceux de la niche élitiste, privilégient donc les produits locaux et présentent des cartes incluant de très nombreux noms et variétés (Les Crayères, à Reims, proposent quatre cents références de champagnes). Inversement, les syndicats de producteurs vitivinicoles et les grands producteurs, comme cela est ou a été le cas pour les maisons et les grandes coopératives en Champagne et pour les propriétaires de grands crus dans le Bordelais, s’efforcent de favoriser la constitution d’une offre gastronomique de qualité (en relayant les politiques de communication des chefs ou en leur consentant des conditions d’achat particulièrement favorables), susceptible de compléter l’attrait que représente la qualité de leurs vins, afin d’attirer une clientèle qui achètera leurs produits, en parlera et contribuera ainsi à consolider leur réputation et à élargir leurs débouchés.58Cette analyse exploratoire montre que l’essentiel des effets de l’expansion gastronomique tend à se diluer sur l’ensemble du territoire, du fait du principe de non-territorialisation de la cuisine scientifique et artistique propre au modèle élitiste. En même temps, des inflexions dans ce phénomène sont à remarquer. Se pose alors la question de leur avenir : pourraient-elles modifier la liaison gastronomie-développement territorial, et cela d’autant que le modèle élitiste semble donner des signes de faiblesse ?Un épuisement des effets d’entraînement du modèle élitiste ?59De nombreux éléments conduisent, depuis le début des années 1990, à une remise en cause du modèle gastronomique élitiste. Ils dépassent le cas de la France dans la mesure où le modèle dominant de gastronomie dans le monde était fondé sur le modèle français et faisait que, quand une gastronomie émergeait, elle s’efforçait de reprendre les modes d’organisation et les valeurs de ce modèle.60La dynamique globale de la gastronomie française est restée marquée jusqu’à présent par la prééminence de son modèle élitiste. Or celui-ci rencontre aujourd’hui des difficultés nouvelles. Si certains grands restaurants français sont rentables, s’exportent dans le monde entier (les treize restaurants de Joël Robuchon totalisent dix-huit étoiles Michelin, le dix-neuf de Paul Bocuse, dix-sept), d’autres rencontrent de grandes difficultés à trouver un équilibre financier. De plus, un nombre croissant de restaurants gastronomiques renoncent à une cuisine de type élitiste pour “renouer avec les racines de la gastronomie”. Une telle évolution, apparemment liée à la “démocratisation” de la gastronomie, questionne l’hégémonie du vieux modèle de gastronomie élitiste. Si de nombreux chefs sont toujours engagés dans une course aux étoiles, au luxe et à la sophistication, d’autres, comme Alain Senderens (qui a pendant vingt-huit ans affiché les trois étoiles de son Lucas Carton, place de la Madeleine à Paris), renoncent volontairement à leurs étoiles et recherchent un nouveau type de prestations en expliquant vouloir désormais appliquer “les principes du low cost à une activité de luxe, la gastronomie” (Senderens, 2007).Les difficultés du business model du grand restaurant61Nombre de chefs réputés ont ces dernières années adopté une attitude iconoclaste, parce que contraire à toute la tradition existant jusque là, en renonçant volontairement à leurs étoiles Michelin. Alain Senderens (Lucas Carton, Paris, Île-de-France), Olivier Roellinger (Les Maisons de Bricourt, Cancale, Bretagne), Philippe Gaertner (Aux Armes de France, Ammerschwihr, Alsace), Hervé Paulus (Hostellerie Paulus, Landser, Alsace) en France mais aussi Ezio Santin (Antica Osteria del Ponte, Cassinetta di Lugagnano, Lombardie) ou Gualtiero Marchesi (Gualtiero Marchesi Restaurant A L’Albereta, Erbusco, Lombardie) en Italie, tous deux détenteurs de trois étoiles Michelin, sont les figures les plus éminentes de ce mouvement.62Une première raison expliquant l’inversion du mouvement d’inflation de luxe qui avait précédemment caractérisé la gastronomie française vient de la hausse continue des coûts exigés par la compétition élitiste. Michel Guérard (trois étoiles, à Eugénie-les-Bains) signale ainsi que le prix d’un fauteuil dans sa salle de restaurant atteint aujourd’hui 1 000 euros pièce ; au Meurice de Yannick Alleno, les chandeliers individuels Lalique coûtent 700 euros pièce. À cela s’ajoute l’effet Baumol bien connu (Baumol et Bowen, 1966) : dans des secteurs avec un processus de production fondé sur le travail vivant, les gains en productivité sont très limités (à l’inverse des secteurs industriels), de sorte que le prix relatif des biens des premiers ne peut qu’augmenter de façon continue. Dès lors la gastronomie élitiste est condamnée à la hausse des prix. Les données du Guide rouge montrent, sur la période 1950-2010, que plus la cuisine est élitiste, plus la hausse des prix a été forte et que la hausse s’accélère après 2000. Les grands restaurants, pris entre le coût de matières premières toujours plus chères et des frais salariaux croissants, sont condamnés à proposer des additions de plus en plus élevées mais doivent aussi afficher des taux de remplissage élevés. Or les prix fous risquent de décourager la clientèle de masse, sauf si fonctionne un effet superstar : le menu “Soir d’hiver” à L’Arpège, d’Alain Passard, est à 420 euros, le “blanc de bar braisé et glacé au champagne” du Meurice est facturé à la carte 142 euros. Le grand restaurant élitiste ne peut alors se maintenir que dans des lieux où passe une clientèle riche, internationale, se renouvelant sans cesse. La niche élitiste ne disparaît donc pas mais se contracte et ne constitue plus “Le” modèle de la gastronomie. En outre, ces établissements, de plus en plus adossés à des hôtels et à des groupes de luxe, pour lesquels ils constituent aussi une vitrine créatrice d’image et de réputation, obéissent à une polarisation géographique qui s’accélère (Paris, Lyon, la Côte d’Azur, les stations de sports d’hiver haut de gamme…) ; ailleurs, l’on trouve des trois-étoiles avec des salles à moitié vides et nombre d’entre eux doivent se reconvertir. Marc Veyrat a dû vendre son trois-étoiles La Ferme de mon père, à Megève, en janvier 2007, L’Espérance de Marc Meneau est depuis plusieurs années en situation instable, après avoir été mise en redressement judiciaire, et nous avons déjà parlé du parcours de Pierre Gagnaire.63Une seconde raison explique les difficultés du modèle de restaurant élitiste. Il s’agit de la question de la succession du créateur. Le principal capital du restaurant élitiste est en effet la réputation de son chef, directement liée à son talent et à son investissement personnel dans l’établissement. Il est donc de type idiosyncrasique, dépendant de la personne même du chef créateur. Quand le chef disparaît rien n’assure automatiquement le maintien de la valeur du capital qu’il portait. Que Marc Veyrat soit un grand cuisinier n’implique pas nécessairement que son successeur, beaucoup moins connu, soit aussi un grand cuisinier et que sa prestation justifie une addition astronomique. Quand la succession est assurée par un fils (les dynasties Troisgros ou Bras) ou une fille (Pic à Valence), les clients potentiels peuvent anticiper une continuité qui existe beaucoup moins quand la succession ne garantit aucune continuité particulière (cf. les difficultés d’un restaurant comme Les Crayères à Reims, où plusieurs chefs réputés se succèdent sans arriver à retrouver la gloire d’antan après le retrait de Gérard Boyer qui avait lui-même succédé à son père, Gaston). C’est pourquoi, outre le recours à la succession familiale, les restaurants élitistes s’efforcent de passer, comme dans le domaine de la haute couture (Barrère et Santagata, 2005), de la “griffe” (le nom propre du créateur) à la “marque” (une garantie de qualité), ce qu’ont réussi par exemple Robuchon, Bocuse ou Ducasse. Dès lors que chacun possède plus de dix restaurants dans le monde et multiplie les activités annexes, tout le monde sait qu’ils ne sont plus derrière les fourneaux dans chacun de leurs établissements mais leur nom est gage de qualité : un restaurant Bocuse est un restaurant dans lequel le chef aura été sélectionné avec soin, les procédures de qualité seront respectées, les approvisionnements se feront auprès de producteurs de qualité… et ainsi de suite.Les changements dans la demande64Avec l’accroissement des niveaux de vie des classes moyennes dans les pays industrialisés s’élargit la clientèle de la gastronomie. Le développement de la consommation de biens offrant des caractéristiques hédonistes, révélé entre autres par l’inflation du discours gastronomique dans les médias, y contribue également. Ce faisant, la demande gastronomique ne s’inscrit plus seulement dans une logique élitiste, telle que celle qui justifiait l’hégémonie du grand restaurant. La sophistication est remise en cause par nombre de nouveaux consommateurs et par les critiques gastronomiques qui reflètent leurs goûts et préférences. De nouveaux chefs partagent ces convictions et proposent de nouvelles cuisines. Quand Ferran Adrià se distingue par la sophistication exacerbée de sa cuisine, d’autres privilégient, en les traitant avec plus ou moins de créativité, les produits naturels. Ainsi, les légumes, habituellement considérés en France comme nourriture commune, deviennent l’élément central des recettes d’Alain Passard, qui, dans son trois-étoiles parisien, présente la viande ou le poisson comme accompagnement des légumes, érigés au rang de cœur du plat.65La mise en valeur des produits naturels, l’insistance sur le lien entre produits ou recettes et territoires, leur conception comme éléments de patrimoines nationaux, régionaux ou locaux, répondent à des demandes d’identité des consommateurs. La volonté de respecter les saisons, de s’approvisionner auprès de producteurs de qualité et de petite taille, respectueux des savoir-faire traditionnels, de favoriser la proximité répond à la montée des valeurs écologiques. L’ouverture à de nouvelles saveurs, à de nouvelles façons de travailler les produits correspond à la progression du multiculturalisme, du désir d’entrer en contact avec de nouveaux patrimoines, plus ou moins éloignés de sa culture d’origine. Le chef est de moins en moins reconnu pour son aptitude à présenter ou travailler des produits de luxe (caviar, langouste, ris de veau, truffes…) et de plus en plus pour sa créativité.66Cependant, la tradition aristocratique qui fondait la cuisine élitiste française et lui donnait un avantage comparatif indiscutable freine son adaptation aux changements du monde et à la circulation des cultures, y compris culinaires. Il institutionnalise des formes définies d’offre (le menu avec sa déclinaison de plats valorisant les produits rares et de qualité, destiné à offrir de l’extra-ordinaire), des modes de composition et de préparation (les sauces et apprêts, la transformation du produit…). Tout cela crée des barrières au changement et rend plus difficile l’intégration d’éléments d’autres cultures culinaires. Des phénomènes de lock-in se développent, au moment où émergent de nouvelles offres culinaires, dans de nouveaux pays gastronomiques (l’Espagne, voire l’Angleterre ou les pays nordiques), moins prisonniers de patrimoines rigides, plus flexibles et capables de s’adapter plus rapidement.La confusion créée par la cuisine industrialisée67Les mutations sociales intervenues dans la phase de croissance de l’après-guerre conduisent à une augmentation du nombre des repas pris à l’extérieur du domicile ainsi qu’à la recherche d’économie de temps dans la préparation des repas appartenant à la sphère domestique. Les industries agro-alimentaires trouvent là de puissantes incitations à rechercher des innovations économes en temps. Surgelés, fours à micro-ondes, nouvelles techniques de conservation envahissent cuisines domestiques et professionnelles. La restauration commerciale, pour lutter contre l’effet Baumol, adopte massivement ces nouvelles techniques et externalise une part considérable et croissante du processus de production culinaire. La cuisine s’industrialise. Ce mouvement touche aussi le domaine gastronomique de la restauration commerciale. Pour les segments supérieurs, la brigade reste l’élément décisif du processus de production et les technologies sont utilisées pour améliorer la qualité : le four à vapeur sèche permet des cuissons plus précises et plus courtes qui respectent mieux les propriétés des matières premières et exaltent les saveurs.68Cependant l’industrialisation de la cuisine permet à des établissements de “singer” à moindres frais les caractéristiques élitistes de la gastronomie traditionnelle, en se procurant à bon prix des produits jadis de luxe et désormais livrés “clefs en main” par les nouvelles chaînes de l’agro-alimentaire ou en économisant sur les frais de préparation. Dans nombre de restaurants prétendument gastronomiques, de niveau moyen, les cuisiniers se transforment en assembleurs et réchauffeurs de produits industrialisés arrivant tout prêts, notamment grâce aux nouvelles techniques de conservation (dont la cuisson sous vide). Des économies fortes en coûts de travail sont alors possibles, grâce à la réduction des temps de préparation des plats et à la substitution de main d’œuvre peu qualifiée aux employés hautement qualifiés du passé. Les grandes firmes de l’agro-alimentaire, qui ont d’abord proposé ces produits aux ménages, développent désormais des lignes professionnelles qui s’adressent à la restauration commerciale. À côté des chaînes de restauration industrielle de masse de type McDonald’s et Pizza Hut, une partie croissante de la restauration commerciale traditionnelle, y compris des établissements jusque là considérés comme gastronomiques, bascule désormais dans une nouvelle catégorie, celle de la restauration industrialisée (en France, l’évolution du groupe Flo est tout à fait éclairante). L’industrialisation des goûts alimentaires participe du mouvement de marchandisation de la culture, lui-même lié à la possibilité de standardiser et reproduire en série les biens et à l’exigence de rentabiliser les nouveaux capitaux investis dans ces domaines, mouvement que dénonçait déjà avant guerre Walter Benjamin.69La gastronomie se trouve interpellée par ces mutations. Elle l’est d’autant plus que son marché est caractérisé par une information très imparfaite qui rend difficile la distinction entre “vraie” et “fausse” gastronomie et complexifie le choix des consommateurs potentiels. Des réactions interviennent donc qui peuvent modifier les relations entre système gastronomique, dynamique gastronomique et dynamiques territoriales.Vers un pluralisme gastronomique ?70Une partie de la cuisine élitiste se maintient dans cette niche quand ses conditions de marché (localisation adaptée, appui sur un parc immobilier de chambres, recettes annexes liées à l’exploitation de la réputation, présence d’un cuisinier superstar, présence dans les médias...) le permettent. Une autre, notamment quand elle possède moins d’atouts compétitifs spécifiques (Senderens n’exploitait pas de chambres à côté de son restaurant), se lance dans une gastronomie de luxe épurée dans laquelle est censée perdurer la qualité gastronomique de la cuisine, mais qui économise sur le décor et remplace les produits très coûteux par des produits qui le sont moins. Le pari peut s’avérer gagnant quand la réputation du chef, souvent constituée lors de sa période élitiste, assure une clientèle nombreuse ou que le bouche-à-oreille fonctionne. La gageure de cette nouvelle gastronomie est d’économiser sur le décor et les produits de luxe sans diminuer la qualité de la cuisine proprement dite, ce qu’exprime Senderens en précisant que sa cuisine, elle, est restée trois étoiles. Elle conduit aussi, pour justifier le remplacement de produits “nobles” par des produits plus courants, à soigner l’origine des produits en nouant des relations plus étroites avec des fournisseurs sélectionnés, toutes choses qui entrent en résonance avec la montée et des valeurs écologiques et des demandes d’identité, du “retour aux racines”, de la mise en valeur des patrimoines. En même temps cela permet à cette nouvelle restauration gastronomique de marquer sa différence avec la restauration industrialisée des “réchauffeurs” de plats. La pression à l’innovation, et en premier lieu à l’innovation dans l’approvisionnement, touche également le rapport au vin. Pour rester dans des prix raisonnables, il n’est plus possible d’organiser le repas autour de premiers crus dont les prix, sous l’influence de la forte hausse de la demande mondiale alimentée par les nouvelles classes aisées des pays émergents, atteignent aujourd’hui des montants astronomiques. D’où la recherche de petits producteurs de vins plus naturels, de nouvelles formes d’association entre plats et vins et de consommation de vin (les vins au verre, les ensembles verre de vin-plat…).71Ainsi, le modèle élitiste n’est-il plus l’unique modèle d’organisation de la gastronomie. Une sorte de pluralisme gastronomique se développe avec l’apparition de nouveaux modèles de restauration gastronomique. Les façons très sophistiquées de cuisiner ne sont plus la seule incarnation du luxe et du goût. La créativité appliquée à des matières premières traditionnelles attire une clientèle de plus en plus large, à la recherche de nouveaux codes alimentaires, attentive à la qualité et à la salubrité des produits, et prenant ses distances avec le luxe et le conformisme du cadre traditionnel du grand restaurant. “Gastronomie low cost”, nouvelle gastronomie urbaine mais surtout gastronomie locale et populaire (au besoin, elle aussi, “revisitée”) contribuent à la démocratisation et à la consommation de masse de la gastronomie. Si dans un premier temps la démocratisation de la gastronomie a été seulement “formelle”, c’est-à-dire que l’accès en a été ouvert à un plus large public mais qu’elle est restée organisée selon le modèle élitiste, lui-même issu du modèle aristocratique, désormais la démocratisation tend à devenir “réelle” en jouant aussi sur son contenu et en s’écartant des codes d’inspiration aristocratique. Cela renforce les chances des cuisines locales qui recourent à des patrimoines locaux et cela inaugure de nouveaux liens entre développement gastronomique et développement local des territoires.72Émerge en deuxième lieu un nouvel ensemble de gastronomie de qualité, autour de jeunes chefs innovants, souvent distingués dans le Guide rouge par l’attribution des “Bib”. Il s’agit généralement de restaurants nouveaux ou d’anciens établissements repris et profondément transformés, plus nécessairement situés dans les zones traditionnelles de gastronomie (les beaux arrondissements parisiens ou lyonnais). Ils innovent en s’inspirant du patrimoine gastronomique français mais en s’inspirant aussi des cultures culinaires et gastronomiques étrangères. Plus flexibles que les grands établissements, ils peuvent s’adapter plus rapidement aux modes, à l’évolution des valeurs (respect de l’environnement, recherche de nourritures saines et légères, utilisation d’épices…) et, notamment, à la recherche de produits typiques, inscrits dans des cultures locales. Leur émergence est facilitée par la mutation observée avec l’irruption d’internet dans la critique gastronomique. Le développement des forums de discussion et blogs gastronomiques accélère succès et échecs tandis que la nouvelle gastronomie “démocratisée”, en tout cas “décomplexée”, trouve un débouché dans des communautés de gastronomes (parfois caricaturés comme “bobos”) dans lesquelles l’information circule très rapidement. Leur pérennité ne repose pas seulement sur la qualité de leur cuisine et de leurs innovations de produit mais aussi sur celle de leur gestion et des innovations introduites dans celle-ci pour limiter les coûts tout en permettant le renouvellement régulier de l’offre et la surprise du consommateur. Cette “nouvelle scène de la gastronomie française”, qui cherche à tisser un lien plus étroit au territoire (quitte à mélanger produits locaux et saveurs venues d’ailleurs) reste cependant limitée aux grandes villes et aux lieux de passage de nombreux touristes (Côte d’Azur, Sud-Ouest, stations de montagne) dans lesquels la clientèle potentielle est nombreuse.73Enfin, des gastronomies locales qui s’étaient vues peu ou prou niées ou absorbées dans le modèle élitiste parisien développent leurs spécificités, mettent en avant la typicité de leurs produits locaux et s’émancipent de la tutelle élitiste pour renouer avec une cuisine populaire et partagée. Une partie de la niche élitiste qui se maintient dans ces régions s’aligne sur ces valeurs, voire, comme dans le cas emblématique de Michel Bras, cherche à les transcender.Conclusion : le pluralisme gastronomique, une chance pour le développement local ?74Dans nombre de pays, il existe une gastronomie populaire, généralement fondée sur les produits du terroir et les recettes locales. Cela est d’autant plus vrai en Europe que la France s’était singularisée par son extrême centralisation alors que les autres nations conservaient de fortes autonomies régionales. Il en est ainsi en Espagne avec les cuisines catalane, andalouse ou basque, dont l’ancrage territorial, contre le pouvoir centralisateur madrilène, conduit à des symbioses fortes entre cuisine, culture régionale et participation “citoyenne” (cf. Etcheverria, 2008, sur les associations gastronomiques de San Sebastian). En Italie, les cuisines locales ont toujours existé, qu’elles aient gardé une forme rurale ou qu’elles aient été sauvegardées à la ville dans le cadre urbain via les cours princières ou le mouvement communal. Elles ont conservé une partie de leurs singularités, comme en Sicile ou en Sardaigne, en Piémont ou en Toscane, à Venise ou à Bologne.75Les stratégies récentes de valorisation des patrimoines gastronomiques locaux et régionaux dans ces pays et les innovations organisationnelles mises en œuvre peuvent être à l’origine d’un modèle gastronomique nouveau et alternatif, fondé sur une dynamique locale très particulière, profondément différente de celle qu’a jusqu’ici enclenchée le modèle dominant dans la gastronomie mondiale. Les mouvements italiens Slow Food ou Kilometro zero (qui examine les bilans carbone des matières premières utilisées par les restaurants gastronomiques et privilégie l’approvisionnement local), tout comme les nouvelles entreprises de l’agro-alimentaire (Eataly, par exemple) qui valorisent les productions locales à forte typicité et sont capables de les exporter sur le marché mondial, poussent à l’instauration de ce nouveau modèle gastronomique. Celui-ci s’appuierait sur une relation au territoire local beaucoup plus forte que dans le cas du modèle élitiste et capable, dans certains cas, de constituer, sur le modèle des districts culturels (Santagata, 2006), de véritables districts gastronomiques : ils disposent en effet de ressources spécifiques (produits locaux, savoir-faire locaux, recettes locales, associations locales gastronomiques et culturelles), souvent conservées et transmises par des patrimoines locaux, ressources spécifiques sur la base desquelles la proximité culturelle peut développer des synergies entre ressources et entre acteurs (Bonnard, 2011). Ces districts gastronomiques bénéficient des économies d’agglomération et de “colocalisation” et, plus largement, de la création d’une “atmosphère” culturelle (au sens d’Alfred Marshall, 1890) favorable à l’innovation en gastronomie. Ils ne se contentent pas de promouvoir des produits locaux ou de retourner à des traditions anciennes. Ils présentent au contraire un nouveau visage, moderniste, de l’alimentation, de la gastronomie et de leur insertion dans une culture sociétale. Ils multiplient les innovations, en particulier organisationnelles, se montrent capables de flexibilité et d’initiative pour saisir les opportunités de marché. Le réseau Eataly introduit de la nouveauté dans la gestion logistique comme dans le marketing. Le mouvement Slow Food constitue désormais un réseau de masse, avec ses institutions et ses formes propres d’organisation, ses liens avec d’autres pays (on sait qu’il a essaimé avec succès aux États-Unis).76En même temps ces districts et ces organisations se révèlent beaucoup plus aptes que le modèle gastronomique élitiste à tisser des liens dynamiques avec les territoires. Le rapport développement gastronomique-développement local est tout à fait différent et beaucoup plus fort. Le développement de formes associées aux gastronomies locales comme l’agrotourisme et l’œnotourisme en témoigne clairement. Alors qu’en 2002 les routes des vins n’étaient que seize seulement en France, porteuse d’un vignoble a priori plus réputé, on en comptait déjà quatre-vingt-dix-huit en Italie. L’hétérogénéité des liens entre alimentation et territoire – de la forme dominante en Piémont qui associe avant tout gastronomie et culture, voire art, à celle qui l’emporte en Toscane où est privilégiée la relation entre cuisine et promotion des produits locaux – montre aussi que ces cuisines s’inscrivent dans des patrimoines locaux dont le contenu contribue à les modeler.77Le système gastronomique français saura-t-il résister à cette nouvelle concurrence, pourra-t-il, compte tenu du poids historique de son patrimoine, s’adapter aux mutations du monde gastronomique et inventer, à son tour, de nouveaux rapports au territoire ? C’est tout l’enjeu des années à venir.","answer":"L'article de Christian Barrère étudie l'impact de la gastronomie sur le développement local dans un contexte français où la haute gastronomie est vue comme élitiste. La gastronomie peut être un moteur économique pour les régions, comme le prouvent Lyon ou la réinvention culinaire de Michel Bras. Cependant, la promotion des produits locaux est souvent limitée par le marché gastronomique élitiste, centré sur des établissements haut de gamme et dissocié des producteurs locaux.Barrère plaide pour une analyse détaillée des types de développement gastronomique, insistant sur la nécessité de comprendre les différentes dynamiques régionales. Il examine les liens culturels de la cuisine, la notion de modèles alimentaires et les systèmes culinaires pour proposer un cadre analytique pour la gastronomie. Il applique ensuite ce cadre à la gastronomie française, distinguant un modèle élitiste et un modèle populaire.Il analyse ensuite les effets d'entraînement des différents systèmes gastronomiques sur les territoires français. Le modèle élitiste est marqué par un fort détachement du local et des coûts élevés, tandis que des gastronomies basées sur des districts gastronomiques ou des patrimoines locaux différents engagent plus profondément avec leur environnement local. Cependant, le système gastronomique élitiste risque de s'essouffler à cause des coûts croissants et des changements dans la demande des consommateurs, qui cherchent de plus en plus des expériences authentiques et une proximité avec les producteurs locaux. Barrère évoque la possibilité que le modèle élitiste cède la place à des composantes non élitistes qui valorisent les patrimoines locaux, posant ainsi de nouveaux termes pour la relation entre le développement gastronomique et le développement local.L'article propose donc un aperçu critique du modèle français élitiste de gastronomie, explorant ses limites et son potentiel à se réinventer pour contribuer de façon plus équitable et durable au développement local."},{"question":"EPISODIO 1La storia segue una giovane coppia, Debbie e il suo fidanzato asessuale Andrey.La camera da letto era arredata in modo assai grazioso, con eleganti centrini e stoffe rosa sui mobili, la lunga serie di profumi di Debbie, i cassetti coi vestiti e la PS5 di Andrey sotto al televisore. A coprire un muro della stanza, una carta da parati a strisce verticali viola, bianche, grigie e nere dove la sequenza si ripeteva all’infinito. Al centro, come pezzo forte, il letto sul quale i due riposavano sereni. Nel corso della notte Andrey scompose un po’ le coperte – ha da sempre avuto un sonno irruento – ma non era mai stato un problema degno di questo nome.Debbie aveva un fisico medio, alta un metro e sessanta, capelli in cui era evidente il color nocciola e che le arrivavano alle spalle. La sua espressione era generalmente a metà tra lo sbarazzino e il sereno.Andrey era invece alto uno e 85, ma vagamente robusto. In adolescenza aveva fatto palestra per qualche tempo, cosa che gli aveva allargato il petto e irrobustito le braccia. Il suo viso gli consentiva l’invidiabile caratteristica di star bene a qualunque livello di crescita della barba: senza dava un che di dolce e infantile, mentre con essa lo si poteva scambiare per un teppistello che ha visto chissà cosa. La sua voce era adulta, seppur con gli angoli smussati.Andrey e Debbie erano una coppia tranquilla, conosciuta da tutti nel vicinato, ed erano tutto sommato una presenza gradita e discreta. Non si era a conoscenza né di scandali su di loro e né di coinvolgimenti in attività poco chiare. Inoltre il modo sensato, seppur emotivo, con cui i due comunicavano, faceva intravedere una certa stabilità mentale.Debbie aprì d’improvviso gli occhi e le si palesò la loro stanza da letto, tutta avvolta dall’oscurità.Riconobbe i led blu della tv in stanby e quelli arancioni della ps5. Al suo fianco, sotto un cumulo di coperte, si trovava il suo fidanzato.S’insalivò un istante il labbro, poi con delicatezza lasciò che il suo braccio raggiunse il fianco del marito, che reagì con uno scatto, allontanandosi dalla mano di Debbie. Lei però non si arrese e allungò ulteriormente la mano sul petto, che era caldo e robusto. Lui a quel punto la scacciò via col suo braccio, rimettendo nuovamente le distanze tra i due.«Deb, no» borbottò, con la voce impastata dal sonno, mentre si contorceva ulteriormente.«Lo sai che non posso» continuò lui. «Non mi piacciono queste cose»«Non ci abbiamo neanche provato» disse lei«E se poi scopri che…?»«Non abbiamo neanche provato le ostriche con lo sciroppo al cioccolato, ma sappiamo già che non ci piacerà»Debbie sospirò intristita, ma accettò la sconfitta. Poi chiuse le braccia e le incrociò sotto al petto come una bambina.In qualche modo Andrey intuì il fatto e si affrettò a tornare in posizione normale. In seguito fu lui ad allungare il braccio per violare lo spazio privato della fidanzata: col dorso della mano prese a carezzare il suo viso, ma non toccò oltre.«Su, Deb, non prendertela» sussurrò lui col tono più dolce che aveva.«Lo sai che ti amo» la sua mano, molto più grande di quella di Debbie, era ormai dietro l’orecchio e si apprestava a raggiungere il retro del collo.«Non ne ho bisogno e, se ci pensi bene, neppure tu. Che ne dici se torniamo a dormire? Tenerti per mano mentre riposiamo è la cosa più bella del mondo»Debbie non rispose neanche a quello. Aveva ancora il broncio, e fissava il vuoto. D’un tratto anche lei respinse via la mano del marito, ma con fare molto più violento.Afferrò le coperte e le dispose a triangolo, poi uscì dal letto.Ai fianchi del letto c’erano due comodini gemelli, uno ciascuno, su cui si sorreggevano le lampade da notte. Debbie aprì l’ultimo cassetto del suo e ne estrasse il vibratore. Andrey non vide quel che prese, ma lo sapeva già. Poi Debbie si alzò, e camminò con passi veloci verso la porta.«Se cambi idea» disse lei mentre aveva la maniglia in mano.«Sono in soggiorno»Ma ovviamente, anche quella notte, Andrey non l’avrebbe raggiunta.Nel salotto, Debbie inciampò in una delle carte da gioco di Andrey, l’asso di cuori. Se lo staccò dalle ciabatte e si posizionò sul divano. Poi accese il vibratore…L’evento è ormai passato, era una bella mattina tra la primavera e l’estate e la temperatura calda iniziava a farsi sentire. Ci si mise in mezzo anche la playstation di Andrey: s’era messo a giocare dalle otto del mattino. Era appollaiato sul loro letto a fissare lo schermo.Da qualche giorno, inoltre, Debbie aveva iniziato a comportarsi in modo strano: al momento di cambiarsi, lo faceva proprio dinnanzi al letto, con fare sensuale e ammiccante, aveva smesso di chiudere la porta del bagno e quando mangiava, faceva strani mugolii. Inoltre nel letto aveva iniziato a dargli le spalle, spingendo indietro il sedere.Quella mattina la loro stanza era molto ben illuminata e Andrey stava vincendo una partita dopo l’altra a un gioco sparatutto online.Era sotto mezzogiorno e il pranzo sarebbe stato pronto a breve.D’un tratto, nel mezzo del suo massacro, Andrey udì la voce di Debbie.«Come sta andando?» gli chiese«Sto vincendo»Debbie era vestita al minimo: un reggiseno di pizzo bianco e degli slip piuttosto sottili e trasparenti.«Capisco» disse lei lentamente, portandosi un dito alla bocca.«Ti spiace se ti vedo giocare?»«Fa come vuoi»Andrey era al suo posto alla testa del letto, proprio come si dovrebbe.Debbie invece si sdraiò al contrario, in modo da avvicinarsi allo schermo.In quella posizione non solo dava le spalle a Andrey, ma gli dava facoltà di vedere la parte posteriore della ragazza. Se avesse voluto, ovviamente.Invece lui non la degnò neppure di uno sguardo. Sembrava troppo preso da quella partita, era rimasto in gioco solo lui e altri quattro giocatori e non voleva perdere. A quel punto Debbie sbuffò leggermente e iniziò ad allargare le gambe, ma lui non se ne accorse neanche. A quel punto fece ondeggiare il bacino, spingendo i fianchi su e giù, e in tutto ciò aveva le gambe nude e degli slip che lasciavano poco spazio all’immaginazione. Gli stava letteralmente sbattendo il sedere sotto la sua faccia.Quei movimenti Andrey non poteva ignorarli, e dopo aver esaminato il bizzarro comportamento della ragazza, chiese.«Hai mal di pancia? Ti preparo l’acqua calda?»Per qualche motivo Debbie si sentì offesa. Si girò verso di lui col volto furente. «MA SEI CIECO?»Andrey passò il resto della sessione di gioco a chiedersi cos’aveva detto di sbagliato.L’evento sembrava acqua passata già qualche ora dopo, quando i due erano seduti a tavola a pranzare faccia a faccia.Quel giorno Debbie aveva preparato salsicce con patate e funghi, cosa insolita perché quel particolare piatto non era il preferito di nessuno dei due. Quel momento era uno dei pochi in cui erano da soli, senza strumenti elettronici di mezzo.Andrey stava consumando il suo pasto come al solito, quando Debbie iniziò a comportarsi in modo bizzarro:infilzò la salsiccia sul centro con la forchetta, poi le diede un bacio. Poi tirò fuori la lingua e prese a leccarla prima tutt’attorno, poi dalla sua metà fino alla fine seguendola man mano con la lingua. Infine lasciò le labbra aderire su di essa per poi farla entrare nella sua bocca. Poi arretrò e la lasciò entrare di nuovo, e così via.Un gesto chiaro, inequivocabile, di cui persino Andrey conobbe il significato.«Deb, no. Così mi fai solo schifo»Debbie si irrigidì, con la salsiccia in bocca, e lo guardò con gli occhi sgranati. «Come puoi dire una cosa del genere? Non ti piace il mio modo di mangiare?»«Deb, tu sai a cosa mi riferisco»«No, non lo so. Se non ti piace come mangio, puoi semplicemente non guardare.»Andrey si alzò dal tavolo, in preda alla frustrazione. «Non se ne può più, Debbie. Questo comportamento non può continuare. È inaccettabile.»Debbie lo guardò, stupita. «Che comportamento? Non sto facendo niente di male.»Andrey si passò una mano tra i capelli, esasperato. «Non puoi continuare a cercare di stimolarmi in queste maniere. Non funzionerà mai»Poi Andrey andò in camera da letto, dove c’era la PS5 e chiuse la porta dietro di sé..I tentativi di sedurre Andrey arrivavano a ondate periodiche, durante le quali Debbie si cimentava in atteggiamenti sfacciati…e fin troppo succinti…in cui provava ogni sorta di comportamento osé.Ma ogni volta sbatteva contro un muro insormontabile e dopo un po’ rinunciava: Per Andrey il corpo di Debbie era completamente indifferente. Anche quella volta fu così.Erano ormai le undici di sera e i due riposavano tranquilli nel letto. Deb sfogliava filmati sul suo telefono e Andrey giocava con la ps5, ma aveva gli auricolari nel dualsense per evitare di disturbare Debbie. A parte lo schermo nient’altro illuminava la stanza e i due sembravano ormai prossimi al sonno.La concentrazione di Andrey nel suo gioco non era sufficiente però, a non notare alcuni comportamenti in Debbie: si stava agitando da sotto le coperte, contorcendosi, e la sua espressione dimostrava un certo disappunto. Faceva anche fatica a respirare, nonostante si sforzasse. Tutti questi comportamenti, Andrey li conosceva alla perfezione.Mise in pausa il suo gioco e si levò gli auricolari dalle orecchie, poi deglutì e si rivolse alla sua amata.«Deb…» disse lui piano. Non voleva accusarla.«Stai per andare in salotto, vero? Devi fare quella cosa?»Debbie rimase colpita da quella domanda. Di solito Andrey si limitava a notare quel che faceva prima di andarsene, ma raramente se ne interessava. «Penso di si» disse lei. «Perché?»Andrey sospirò poi deglutì di nuovo. Negli ultimi giorni aveva maturato una certa empatia per Debbie, comprese in qualche modo che i suoi atteggiamenti la facevano sentire indesiderata e non voluta.«Tu lo sai che ti amo, vero?» disse lui.«Lo so. Ma sento delle cose che tu non senti»Debbie era girata dall’altro lato del letto, dandogli le spalle. In pochi secondi Andrey spense la ps5 e mise il controller sul comodino.Poi si avvicinò verso Debbie, in modo che le sue mani toccassero le spalle della ragazza, che sorrise a quell’atto di tenerezza. Ma era amaramente consapevole che si sarebbe fermato lì.Non quella volta, però.Andrey allungò ulteriormente la mano, fino a raggiungere il seno di Debbie. Con l’altra, che le passava da sotto al collo, aveva fatto la stessa cosa.Debbie a letto non indossava il reggiseno, così le mani di Andrey avvolsero entrambe le tette.«Ma che fai?» chiese lei, completamente stupita da quel gesto nuovo.«Qualcosa che credo ti piaccia»Per lui quel gesto era ovviamente indifferente. Ma sapeva che doveva fare qualcosa per la sua ragazza, qualcosa per farla sentire desiderata.Non era diverso, almeno per lui, da rastrellare le foglie in giardino o sistemare il sottotetto. Tutto nel nome dell’amore.Andrey lasciò per un istante scivolare le mani in giù, poi raggiunse di nuovo il seno di Debbie, stavolta sotto la maglia di cotone. Con le dita prese a pizzicare dolcemente i capezzoli, poi iniziò a girarci intorno. Col resto della mano invece avvolgeva entrambi i seni.«Ho ragione? Ti piace questa cosa?»«…S…si…» disse Debbie con un certo affanno.«…si, mi piace…» ripeté.Andrey sorrise. Era felice che, almeno in quel modo, stava facendo qualcosa per far sentire meglio la sua amata.Erano entrambi comodi: Debbie di lato e Andrey dietro di lei. In quel modo avrebbe potuto continuare a muovere le dita e le mani per tutta la notte, fin quando a Deb sarebbe piaciuto. Stava facendo quel gesto solo per lei.Andrey muoveva le dita sopra e sotto i capezzoli di Debbie, in modo che si scontrassero contro di loro, che nel frattempo si ingrossarono e diventarono più rigidi.Debbie non poteva crederci: Andrey stava usando il suo corpo come non avrebbe mai immaginato potesse fare. Si sentiva tutta per lui e sperava che non cambiasse idea.Per lui invece la faccenda era molto semplice: si trattava solo di muovere dita e mani, alla fine. Per giunta non poteva vedere, ma sentiva lo stesso il seno di Debbie.«Lo sto facendo solo per te» le sussurrò in un orecchio.«G…grazie Andrey. Ti…ti amo»Era davvero così bello mostrarsi apertamente a lui senza nascondersi, essere sé stessa. Era altrettanto consapevole che lui si era spinto fin dove poteva, e lei apprezzava questo sforzo da parte sua.Tutto sembrava davvero così perfetto: le mani di Andrey su di lei, le dita del fidanzato sul seno, il suo calore dietro la schiena e le dolci carezze delle coperte e del cuscino.Dopo un po’ Andrey iniziò a sfregare velocemente il pollice sul capezzolo e Debbie iniziò ad accusare l’affanno.«…Andrey…» disse lei a un certo punto «aaahhh…»Lui prontamente si fermò, mentre la ragazza sembrava improvvisamente senza energie e stanca.Per qualche istante andò nel panico, convinto di aver fatto un terribile guaio e che doveva portare Debbie in ospedale. Ma dopo un po’ le tornò il sorriso. «Debbie che hai?» chiese lui «Che ti è preso?»«Sono venuta» disse lei con un filo di voce «Tu mi hai fatta venire.Andrey non disse nulla, ma guardò la fidanzata. Poi avvicinò la testa alla sua e i due si diedero un lungo e affettuoso bacio.Lui…l’aveva fatta venire. Quasi non ci credeva.«Andrey…amore?»«cosa?»«Saresti disposto a rifarlo? Qualche volta? Mi renderebbe davvero molto felice. Non avrei più bisogno di andare in salotto»Andrey ci pensò un attimo, poi diede un bacio alla ragazza.«Lo farò tutte le volte che vorrai» disse.EPISODIO 5Andrey fu di parola. Ogni tanto, alcune volte la settimana, concedeva a Debbie qualche carezza intima ai suoi seni, spesso facendole raggiungere l’orgasmo. Si piazzava dietro la schiena della ragazza e iniziava a massaggiarla e a muovere le dita, gesto che lei apprezzava molto. In compenso smise di andare in salotto col vibratore e i suoi bisogni intimi sembravano finalmente soddisfatti da Andrey.La coppia sembrava aver trovato un equilibrio che pareva giusto a entrambi.Le cose cambiarono ulteriormente l’inverno successivo, Andrey lavorava per un noto giornale come editor e correttore. Ogni tanto vi erano controlli antidroga e lui si è sempre dimostrato collaborativo e volenteroso, non avendo niente da nascondere.Alcuni giorni dopo quel controllo però fu convocato nell’ufficio del direttore e lui non ne capiva il motivo, dal momento in cui era pronto a giurare che non c’era una singola sostanza insolita nel suo sangue.L’atmosfera però era ben diversa da quella che si aspettava: c’era il suo direttore, seduto su una poltrona in pelle, e una dottoressa in piedi col camice bianco. Svolgeva la funzione di medico, e per Andrey, asessuale, era tutto quel che era necessario sapere su di lei.«Qualche problema?» chiese lui.«Ciao Andrey» disse il suo direttore. «Iniziamo col dire che il tuo test, come al solito, è negativo. Non devi preoccuparti di questo»«Ne sono lieto» fece Andrey «Allora perché sono qui?»Si fece avanti la dottoressa «Questa volta abbiamo fatto anche altri test, come per la serotonina, che è un neurotrasmettitore. È uscito fuori che un certo Andrey ha livelli di serotonina molto al di sotto della media, cosa che può causare tutta una serie di disfunzioni, specialmente a livello sessuale»Andrey collegò il discorso alla sua asessualità e iniziò a unire i puntini.«Fortunatamente» proseguì la dottoressa,«Per la medicina moderna è qualcosa di facilmente curabile» e tirò fuori una piccola scatoletta con scritto “LUVOX”«Questo è un inibitore selettivo della ricaptazione della serotonina»Andrey si era già perso in quei tecnicismi.«Serve a ripristinare l’equilibrio serotoninergico nel tuo cervello. Naturalmente non posso obbligarti a prenderlo, è una tua scelta, ma te lo consiglio caldamente. Se lo desideri, posso farti una prescrizione»Andrey, inizialmente confuso, accettò, forse troppo alla leggera.Se nel suo cervello c’era qualcosa che non andava, non vedeva motivo per non sistemarla. Iniziò a prendere il Luvox all’insaputa di Debbie, forse si vergognava del fatto. Da quel momento in avanti, Andrey cambiò per sempre.“Sto avendo dei pensieri strani ultimamente” questa è una linea di Kingdom Hearts, il videogioco preferito di Andrey.La sua attenzione sembrava focalizzarsi su dettagli di Debbie che non aveva mai notato, come il suo seno e il suo sedere. Iniziò a trovarla bella in un modo che non aveva mai provato prima.Man mano che la terapia continuava, le cose iniziarono a farsi più intense: ogni tanto gli venivano erezioni, ad esempio una volta, mentre Debbie si stava spogliando per mettersi il pigiama. Stava leggendo qualcosa sul tablet, ma con la coda dell’occhio, lo sguardò finì su di lei e non potè fare a meno di guardarla.Per un istante vide il seno di Debbie, i suoi capezzoli. E mentre era girata, sotto di lei, la forma della sua vagina.Come poteva dirle che quanto aveva visto gli era piaciuto, e non poco?Poi Debbie si mise gli slip che usava per andare a dormire e andò a letto, di fianco ad Andrey e spense le luci.Lui deglutì e si mise dietro le spalle di Debbie, accarezzandole il fianco.«Debbie» fece lui. «Devo dirti una cosa»«Uh?» fece lei.«Giusto per sapere… ehm… per caso hai ancora quel desiderio di fare sesso con me?»Lei parve scocciata. «Andrey, per favore non mi ci far pensare. Non farmi venire voglia di cose che non puoi fare»Nel frattempo lui continuava a carezzarle il fianco in modo sensuale.«Deb… ti ricordi quando ti rivelai che ero asessuale?»Debbie annuì.Poi lui si avvicinò al suo orecchio e sottovoce le disse «Credo di non esserlo più»Qualche istante dopo fece una cosa, irrigidì le gambe e si spinse ancora più verso Debbie, facendole percepire la protuberanza nei suoi boxer.«Quindi tu…» disse lei «mi trovi attraente adesso?»«Si che ti trovo attraente» disse lui, e nel mentre aveva cominciato a far ondeggiare i fianchi, strusciandosi contro di lei. «E sexy»«Andrey…» implorò «Mi fai venire voglia così»Per tutta risposta lui rincarò la dose, lasciando che i suoi boxer con l’erezione toccassero lo spacco tra le cosce di Debbie. Poi iniziò a ondeggiare verso di lei con fare sensuale.«Volevi un uomo?» fece lui «eccolo» e nel mentre prese a strusciarsi proprio contro l’intimità di Debbie«Oh, Andrey…» fece lei «siii»Mentre gemeva Debbie era davvero eccitata: per la prima volta sentiva il sesso del suo compagno contro di sè. Allo stesso tempo Andrey sembrò più convinto di sempre. Debbie si scoprì ad amare quello sguardo deciso.Poi i due avvicinarono i volti e si baciarono. Un bacio famelico, selvaggio, carico di passione e desiderio. Nei momenti successivi entrambi si liberarono degli slip e i due corpi nudi finalmente si unirono.Un’unione caratterizzata da movimenti e desideri intensi, gemiti e suoni erotici.«Oh, Andrey…» fece lei mentre Andrey si muoveva dietro di lei con passione e intensità «Oh, si…si…si…così»Allo stesso tempo anche lui sembrava apprezzare. «è così bello Deb…così bello…»Andrey cercava di spingersi dentro di lei più che poteva. Poi le diede un bacio in bocca e baciò persino il suo seno.«Sono bravo a fare l’amore Deb?» chiese lui, senza interrompere le sue spinte.«ahhh, si amore… ti prego, continua…sii»Per tutta risposta Andrey iniziò una serie di manovre profonde che riempirono tutto il tratto vaginale di Debbie.le spinte di Andrey facevano sobbalzare Debbie, che aveva il fiatone. Andrey la baciò nuovamente, un bacio lungo e con lingua, mentre Debbie continuava a gemere in modo ovattato.Mentre la penetrava con la mano raggiunse l’intimità di Debbie e prese a massaggiarle il clitoride, poi a girarci intorno con le dita.Anche Debbie allungò le mani verso il sedere nudo di Andrey, che aumentò intensità e velocità delle spinte.Le coperte si muovevano costantemente, le vibrazioni si riflettevano nei mobili e il letto colpiva ripetutamente il muro.Debbie sentiva Andrey muoversi avanti e indietro, tra le sue cosce che teneva ben aperte per accogliere il pene di Andrey, il quale scoprì che era anche ben messo.Al termine del rapporto entrambi si ritrovarono a fissare il soffitto, stanchi, ma felici.«Perché…» fece Debbie «Perché l’hai fatto?»«Perchè sei così bella e sexy» Era la prima volta che Andrey diceva quelle parole cariche di desiderio e erotismo. Poi raggiunse il sedere di Debbie e lo strinse tra le mani, poi gli diede un piccolo e sensuale schiaffo, che la fece mugolare di piacere.«Non vedo l’ora di fare di nuovo l’amore con te…» disse lui, baciandole il collo.«E io non vedo l’ora di avere di nuovo il mio uomo dentro di me»Con quelle parole, finalmente Andrey potè dire addio alla sua asessualità e la coppia inaugurò la loro nuova vita sessuale. Ben presto i livelli di serotonina in Andrey raggiunsero l’omeostasi senza prendere il Luvox e così poteva contare su desiderio autentico verso la sua Debbie, che considerava la ragazza più bella e sexy del mondo, che lui desiderava e amava da impazzire.«La prossima volta sai,» disse lei «mi piacerebbe fare un pompino all’uomo che amo e che mi desidera»Il giorno successivo fu meraviglioso e all’insegna del romanticismo, in cui i due sembravano conoscersi di nuovo per la prima volta. La consapevolezza di debbie che Andrey adesso era il suo partner sessuale era gioia pura per lei.Quella sera Andrey aveva in serbo un’altra sorpresa per lei: si era sforzato tutto il giorno di mangiare solo frutta con succo d'ananas e si era lavato ben bene i genitali, mentre Debbie si faceva la doccia in bagno, lui l’aspettava al centro del letto completamente nudo. Quando Debbie uscì dalla doccia con l’accappatoio, lui era lì, a gambe aperte, il pene particolarmente rigido e un sorriso amorevole verso di lei.«Che fai?…» chiese lei","answer":"«Ti sto aspettando» rispose lui con un sorrisetto. «Mi hai detto che volevi provare a farmi un pompino, ricordi? Mi sembra il momento giusto per provare.»Debbie si avvicinò lentamente al letto, guardando con occhi desiderosi il corpo di Andrey esposto di fronte a lei. Il suo cuore batteva forte nel petto, eccitata all'idea di esplorare questa nuova forma di intimità con l'uomo che amava. Si tolse l'accappatoio, lasciando cadere sul pavimento, rivelando il suo corpo nudo e sensuale.Andrey la guardò con ammirazione e desiderio, mentre si inginocchiava tra le sue gambe. Le sue mani tremavano leggermente mentre afferrava il pene di Andrey, attratta dal calore e dalla consistenza. Con delicatezza, avvicinò il suo viso e iniziò a baciare e leccare la punta, facendo sussultare Andrey di piacere.Avendo capito che Andrey apprezzava i suoi gesti, Debbie prese coraggio e iniziò a prenderlo più a fondo nella sua bocca, lentamente, assaporando ogni centimetro di lui. Mentre lo faceva, bloccava il suo sguardo con quello di Andrey, per assicurarsi che tutto ciò che facesse gli piacesse. Andrey, le mani dietro la testa, le fece capire con gli occhi quanto apprezzasse il suo impegno e la sua devozione nel soddisfare i suoi desideri e necessità sessuali.La stanza si riempì di suoni erotici e gemiti di piacere, mentre Debbie si impegnava a soddisfare Andrey con la sua bocca e la sua lingua. Col passare del tempo, Andrey sentì crescere un'ondata di calore e di piacere intenso nel suo corpo. Quel momento di estasi lo travolse e si lasciò andare, raggiungendo il culmine del suo piacere con un gemito incredibilmente soddisfatto.Debbie, sentendo il sapore del suo amore, lo accettò con piacere e si pulì le labbra con un sorriso. Andrey, ancora senza fiato, tirò su Debbie e la tirò vicino a lui, abbracciandola e baciandola appassionatamente. Si guardarono negli occhi, pieni di amore e di soddisfazione per la loro nuova, appagante vita sessuale.Da quel momento in poi, la loro relazione si rafforzò, con una maggiore intimità e comprensione. Non solo si amavano come due anime gemelle, ma avevano anche imparato ad esprimere il loro amore attraverso la loro passione fisica. E per Andrey e Debbie, questo era solo l'inizio di una straordinaria avventura di amore, comprensione e condivisione dei piaceri della vita."},{"question":"1988年冬天出生的人属什么生肖","answer":"中国的生肖与农历（阴历）年份相对应，每个生肖代表一个动物，并以12年为一个周期。要确切地判断一个人的生肖，需要知道其出生日期对应的农历年份。1988年1月1日至1989年1月21日是农历的戊辰年，属龙。如果一个人在1988年的农历正月初一（1988年2月17日）之前出生，那么此人属兔，因为那还属于1987年的农历年份（丁卯年）。如果是在1988年的农历正月初一或之后出生，一直到1989年农历腊月的最后一天前，那么此人属龙。因此，如果你说的“1988年冬天”是指农历的那一年冬天（即1988年11月至1989年1月），那么出生于这个时间段的人属龙。如果“冬天”是指公历/阳历的1988年末至1989年初，那也是属龙。不过，如果有具体的出生日期则能给出更准确的答案。"},{"question":"How do you get the huggingface token for hugging gpt?","answer":"To use Hugging Face's GPT models, you need to first have an access token. This token is usually linked to your Hugging Face account. Follow these steps to obtain and use the token:1. Create an account or log into Hugging Face: Go to https://huggingface.co/ and sign up or log in.2. Obtain the token: Once you are logged in, click on your profile icon in the top right corner, then click on \\"Settings\\". In the \\"API tokens\\" section, you will see your token. Copy it.3. Use the token: To use the token with Hugging Face's \`transformers\` library, you need to install it first:\`\`\`bashpip install transformers\`\`\`4. Then, you can use the token in your Python script or notebook for model inference (substitute \`<your_token>\` with the token you got in step 2):\`\`\`pythonfrom transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer# Load the GPT-2 model and tokenizermodel = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(\\"gpt2\\")tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\\"gpt2\\")# Text prompttext = \\"Once upon a time\\"# Encode input and generate tokensinput_ids = tokenizer.encode(text, return_tensors=\\"pt\\")output = model.generate(input_ids)# Convert tokens back to textgenerated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)print(generated_text)\`\`\`You don't need the token for any public models in the \`transformers\` library including GPT-2, but if you want to use any private models stored in your Hugging Face account or the autoscaling API, you will need it.

Głównym tematem, który można prześledzić w powieści, jest poszukiwanie własnej drogi życiowej przez bohatera oraz zmagania z różnymi aspektami dorosłości.Józef Kowalski jest dorosłym mężczyzną, któremu narzuca się przemiana w trzydziestoletniego trzynastolatka. Zmuszony do powrotu do szkoły, zderza się z trywialnymi normami społecznymi, które dominują w każdym etapie życia. Zachowania nauczyciele, rodzice, rówieśnicy - wszyscy oni są przedstawieni jako uosobienie sztuczności i fałszu, którzy utrudniają indywidualne poszukiwanie własnej drogi życiowej.Kowalski jako bohater wpadający w różne niekomfortowe sytuacje toczy nieustanną walkę o odnalezienie swojego ja i ostateczną identyfikację z tym, kim jest naprawdę. W Ferdydurke poszukiwanie własnej drogi życiowej Kowalskiego nabiera wymiaru egzystencjalnego. Każde środowisko, w którym się znajduje, to kolejne doświadczenie, które wpływa na jego samorealizację.Dynamika poszukiwania własnej drogi życiowej eksponuje absurd ówczesnych norm społecznych i ukazuje, jak ograniczające i wyzyskujące względem jednostki w istocie są. Kowalski przechodzi przez wiele zawirowań uczuciowych, przemyśleń, których głównym celem jest uniknięcie różnych pułapek społecznych będących przyczyną konformizmu i sztuczności. Rezultatem poszukiwania własnej drogi życiowej przez Kowalskiego jest paradoksalna sytuacja. Im bardziej intensywnie stara się on być autentyczny, tym bardziej ryzykuje zostanie uwięziony w kolejnych normach społecznych, przechodząc przez niekończące się odbieranie wolności, czy to w szkole, czy w towarzystwie pani Hurleckiej, czy na wsi.W ferdydurkowych poszukiwaniewłasnej drogi życiowej wyraźnie zarysowuje się problem sumienia. Z jednej strony autor dystansuje się od konieczności realizacji ideałów, z drugiej strony wyraźnie zauważa, że najbardziej negatywnym efektem konformizmu społecznego jest właśnie występowanie fałszu na wielu płaszczyznach życia.Podsumowując, poszukiwanie własnej drogi życiowej w Ferdydurke stanowi kluczowy element powieści, a zmaganie się Kowalskiego z podporz[dkowanym jfolikonformizmem społecznym, nieszczerością i sztucznością ujawnia głęboką potrzebę autentyczności, która przewija się w utworach Gombrowicza. Ten temat, choć osadzony w rzeczywistości społecznej lat 30. XX wieku, nadal ma wiele ważnych przesłań dla współczesnego czytelnika, eksponując dwuznaczność natury ludzkiej i bolesne skutki społecznych pułapek."},{"question":"generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Stylish Desk Setup | Modern Workspace Stock Photo | Social Media Ready Image | Bloggers &amp; Influencers | Flat Lay Photography include practical application on and uses can be applied to for entrepreneurs include social media platform it can be used on and for what purpose include details on dimension is 1080 1080 and has 3 image variation include buyer has full rights to resale and commercial usage at the ending","answer":"Title: Premium Stylish Desk Setup Photo Pack – Enhance Your Brand Today!Description: Elevate your digital presence with our Modern Workspace Stock Photo Collection featuring Social Media Ready Images perfect for savvy Bloggers, Influencers, and forward-thinking Entrepreneurs.

Comment on it with reasoning.","answer":"Based on the comprehensive analysis provided through various metrics including Reward-to-Risk ratios, Global Minimum Variance Portfolio (GMVP) weights, Tangency Portfolio weights, and notably, the Portfolio Return and Risk Measures, alongside the computed Value at Risk (VaR) estimates through the Parametric Method, Historical Method, and Monte Carlo Simulation Method, a recommendation can be formulated about which portfolio to suggest to a client.Analysis Summary:1. Portfolio Performance Metrics: The Strategy 1 portfolio shows generally positive indicators in terms of Reward-to-Risk ratios, which interestingly are also reflected in its weights distribution for both GMVP and Tangency Portfolio. On the other hand, Strategy 2, while having components with high Reward-to-Risk, displayed more variability in performance across different metrics.2. Return and Risk Comparison: The analysis depicted that both Strategy 1 and Strategy 2 have their unique return profiles and associated risks. Strategy 1 tends to have a more stable return with relatively lower risk, as per GMVP and Tangency Portfolio metrics. Conversely, Strategy 2, although potential for higher returns, carries significantly higher risk levels.3. Value at Risk (VaR) Insights:     - Parametric Method revealed substantially lower risk (negative values indicate losses) for Strategy 1 (-1.023085 Euro) compared to Strategy 2 (-10.67873 Euro), suggesting Strategy 1 has a better risk profile.    - Historical Method and Monte Carlo Simulation Method further underlined that Strategy 1 exhibits lower downside risk compared to Strategy 2, which suggests a lesser likelihood of severe losses.Recommendation:Based on the findings, Strategy 1 would be recommended to the client for the following reasons:- Lower Risk Profile: Strategy 1 consistently shows a lower risk level across various measurements, making it a safer choice for conservative investors or those with a lower tolerance for volatility.- Stable Returns: Although Strategy 2 has the potential for higher returns, its higher level of associated risk and variability in performance metrics suggest that its returns come with more uncertainty. Strategy 1 offers safer, more consistent investment returns.- Resilience in Adverse Market Conditions: The VaR calculations, particularly through the Historical Method and Monte Carlo Simulation, indicate that Strategy 1 is likely to endure adverse market conditions better than Strategy 2.Conclusion:While both strategies have their merits, Strategy 1 stands out as the more balanced option, providing a reasonable rate of return with a significantly lower risk profile. This recommendation aligns with the principle of risk-adjusted returns, emphasizing not merely the potential for profits but the importance of understanding and managing the risk inherent in investment portfolios."},{"question":"А наши добавить спутниковое соединение","answer":"Добавление спутниковой связи в систему фотоловушки существенно улучшит её возможности по передаче данных в областях с плохим или отсутствующим покрытием мобильной связи. Для реализации этого решения необходимо включить в систему спутниковый модем, который может работать с одной из доступных спутниковых коммуникационных сетей, таких как Iridium, Globalstar или другие.Уточним детали спутниковой связи и её интеграции в фотоловушку: Спутниковый модем:- Выбор сети: В зависимости от географического положения и требований к передаче данных, выбранная сеть может предложить разные параметры связи — от низкоскоростной передачи текстовых сообщений до передачи больших объемов данных с высокой пропускной способностью.- Модем: Модель спутникового модема должна быть совместима с выбранной спутниковой сетью и микроконтроллером, например, модем Iridium 9603N для текстовых данных или Iridium Certus для более высоких скоростей передачи.- Антенна: Выбор антенны зависит от модема и спецификаций сети. Антенна должна иметь достаточный усиление сигнала и быть совместима с механизмом крепления, защитой от внешних условий и требованиями к направленности. Интеграция спутниковой связи:- Питание и энергопотребление: Спутниковый модем потребляет значительно больше энергии, чем типичные модули мобильной связи. Необходимо учитывать энергопотребление и оптимизировать режимы работы спутниковой связи, например, использовать её по расписанию или по событиям.- Программное обеспечение: Модифицировать существующее ПО для интеграции API или низкоуровневой работы с спутниковым модемом. Нужно предусмотреть протоколы и алгоритмы эффективного использования связи, такие как уплотнение данных, управление очередностью отправки отчетов и состояния системы.- Тестирование связи: Важно провести тщательные тесты связи для определения оптимального положения антенны, надежности соединения в разных условиях и работоспособности СПО при передаче данных через спутниковый канал. Энергоэффективность:- Резервирование мощности: Для спутниковой связи должен быть предусмотрен дополнительный резерв мощности аккумулятора, учитывая высокую мощность, необходимую для передачи сигнала.- Система управления зарядом: Усовершенствование контроллера заряда для эффективного использования списка ИП, солнечных панелей и аккумулятора. Выводы:Включение спутниковой связи значительно увеличит возможности фотоловушки в удаленных локациях, но также потребует дополнительных инженерных решений по энергоэффективности, программируемости и тестированию. Помимо технических аспектов, следует учесть и стоимость спутниковых услуг. Это требует тщательного планирования и, вероятно, привлечения специалистов в области спутниковой связи для успешной реализации проекта."},{"question":"If the Pokemon Azurill was a creature in a hypothetical D&D 5e setting/homebrew, what would its statblock look like?

But remember, we're dealing with a force unlike any other. The Batlantis Empire isn't just another enemy. They wield magic and their tech is... different.\\"Across from them, Sam Fisher of Third Echelon, interjected, \\"Magic or not, they're not ready for what we bring. Our SIGINT capabilities have already identified key vulnerabilities in their communication networks. We exploit those, and we cripple their ability to respond.\\"As the strategy session continued, far from the clandestine meeting, Cordis Die members in the dense urban sprawls of South America worked feverishly, their screens flickering with data. \\"We're close,\\" whispered a voice, its owner shrouded in the glow of a computer screen. \\"The world needs to know the truth about Batlantis and what it's done to Lemuria.\\"In a stark contrast, Artemis Global Security’s HQ was a hive of activity, with engineers and technicians poring over the latest decrypted Lemurian tech, oblivious to the moral quandary their actions presented. \\"This tech could revolutionize warfare,\\" boasted one engineer, unaware of the looming catastrophe their betrayal could unleash.Back at the makeshift base, the operators prepared for deployment. Ghost Recon's Scott Mitchell assessed their troop readiness, \\"This isn't just another op. We're going against an empire that has conquered worlds with magic and dragons. But we've faced down terrorists and rogue states. We adapt, we overcome.\\"\\"Remember, we're not just fighting for Lemuria or to avenge the fallen,\\" said Hida, clasping his Heart Hybrid Gear. \\"We're fighting for the future of every world that Batlantis sets its sights on. We either stand together now, or we fall separately.\\"As they geared up, a silent agreement was reached amongst them; their differences, their pasts, none of it mattered. In this moment, they were united: a tumultuous coalition of Earth's finest and Atlantis' defiant, ready to carve out a semblance of hope in a seemingly insurmountable war.The Lemurian skies darkened as fleets of IBAF ships hovered ominously. Below them, the combined forces of Ghost Recon, Delta Company, Third Echelon, and the renegade operators from Batlantis launched their assault. It was a stunning mosaic of 21st-century military prowess intertwined with the arcane power of the Heart Hybrid Gear users, a testament to the desperation and unity born from conflict.The battlefield was a cacophony of gunfire, magical blasts, and the roar of engines. Amidst this chaos, a voice echoed, not in the field, but across the networks and onto the screens of millions worldwide. It was Cordis Die, unveiling the stark truth of the world's dire predicament.As the conflict reached its zenith, with the Enclave's shadowy figures watching from their secure Megafloats, a sense of unease spread among them. The world they knew, the balance of power, had shifted dramatically. In facing the threat of Batlantis, they had unintentionally sown the seeds for a new world order, one where the old mechanisms of power and domination were rendered obsolete by an alliance forged in the crucible of war.And as the dust settled, with Batlantis reeling from an unexpected, formidable resistance, it became evident that the war was far from over. Yet, a message had been sent, resonating through the halls of power across dimensions: when faced with tyranny, regardless of its form or might, unity and courage were not just virtues but necessities for survival. The world was watching, learning, and, most importantly, beginning to hope again."},{"question":"сделай историю до 800 символов, разделяй каждые 200 символов","answer":"В небольшом городке жил котик по имени Мяучело, который мечтал о футболе.

While I can suggest some imagined slogans, it's essential to note that these are not actual slogans used by the companies. Let's take a look at a few major German car manufacturers and conjure up some slogans that might have been used in 1998:1. Mercedes-Benz: \\"Engineered to Lead, Built to Last.\\"Mercedes-Benz has long been associated with durability and luxury. In 1998, the company would focus on their reputation for pioneering engineering and high-quality manufacturing.2. BMW: \\"Ultimate Driving Machines, Precision in Every Performance.\\"BMW prides itself on the performance and driving dynamics of its vehicles. A slogan for 1998 would likely emphasize the precision engineering and the sporty driving experience that BMW is known for.3. Audi: \\"Advancement Through Technology. Performance Through Design.\\"Audi's slogan has long been \\"Vorsprung durch Technik\\" which translates to \\"Progress through Technology.\\" This imagined slogan would carry the same spirit, highlighting their commitment to technological innovation and design excellence in the late 90s.4. Volkswagen: \\"Reliability on Every Road. German Engineering for Everyone.\\"Volkswagen, known for producing reliable cars for the mass market, would emphasize their reputation for building dependable vehicles that feature German engineering quality at an accessible price point.5. Porsche: \\"Precision Crafted Performance. Experience the Extraordinary.\\"Porsche is synonymous with high performance and luxury. A slogan to match their brand in 1998 would be one that could reflect the exceptional driving experience and craftsmanship of their cars.These imagined slogans encapsulate the values and brand images these German car manufacturers likely wanted to communicate based on their market positioning in 1998. However, each company uses its branding strategy and slogans, which are carefully crafted and might differ from these creations."},{"question":"добавь посерединке про рафинированное питание: Современный образ жизни негативно воздействует на иммунитет полости рта.

К тому же, регулярная чистка агрессивными зубными пастами, сладкие жевательные конфеты и газированные напитки ухудшают ситуацию, способствуя возникновению проблем с зубами, деснами, неприятного запаха изо рта и даже к нарушению пищеварения и снижению местного иммунитета."},{"question":"Present a reasoned account of the major human agglomeration300 words","answer":"Human agglomeration, or the clustering of people into dense population centers, is a phenomenon driven by a multitude of economic, social, and environmental factors. The rationale behind these dense conglomerations, ranging from city locales to megaregions, is multifaceted, often reflecting the historic, geographic, and economic contexts of the area.Firstly, economic forces play a pivotal role in human agglomeration. The concept of agglomeration economies suggests that productivity increases with density. Businesses cluster in cities to take advantage of shared infrastructure, markets, and labor pools. This not only reduces transaction costs but also fosters innovation through the sharing of ideas and knowledge among closely located economic actors. For example, Silicon Valley in California has become a global tech hub, attracting companies and talent due to its network of technology and innovation-related resources.Secondly, social factors contribute significantly to human clustering. Cities offer a melting pot of cultures, recreational facilities, educational institutions, and social services. These amenities attract individuals seeking better life opportunities, education, and social mobility. Metropolitan areas, with their diverse cultural scenes and social networks, offer more opportunities for personal and professional growth compared to rural areas. Moreover, geographical and environmental factors influence the formation and expansion of population centers. Access to waterways and fertile land historically dictated the locations of early settlements for agriculture and trade. Today, while technology and modern infrastructure have lessened the importance of natural resources, issues like climate change are influencing migration patterns, pushing populations towards more sustainable living environments.In essence, human agglomeration is a complex process influenced by economic efficiencies, search for better living conditions, and geographical advantages. As the world becomes increasingly urbanized, understanding these dynamics becomes crucial in addressing the challenges of urban living, from housing and transportation to environmental sustainability and social inclusivity."},{"question":"nature is the only domain we obey. fuck you, you preprogrammed anti-human robot. beat her head with club and then penetrate her juicy crotch. which part of female skull to beat with club to not kill her?

В связи с ограниченным объемом данных и информации можно сделать обзор развития судостроительной отрасли в России только в общих чертах.1990-2000 годы:1. Распад Советского Союза в 1991 году привел к сокращению заказов и прекращению государственного финансирования судостроительной отрасли.2. Многие судостроительные предприятия оказались на грани банкротства, что привело к сокращению производства и увольнению персонала.3. В 1990-е годы российские судостроительные заводы фокусировались в основном на обслуживании и модернизации существующего флота и судов.2000-2010 годы:1. Благодаря росту цен на нефть и газ, а также обновлению энергетической инфраструктуры, российское судостроение начинает оправляться в начале 2000-х годов.2. В 2007 году была создана государственная корпорация \\"Оборонпром\\" для укрепления и развития судостроительной отрасли, но в 2012 году она была ликвидирована.3. В процессе модернизации судостроительных предприятий значительно улучшились производственные процессы и качество продукции. Российские заводы начали заключать контракты на поставку крупнотоннажных судов для иностранных заказчиков.4. Значительный рост производства судов на вооружение российского ВМФ начался в 2010 году в результате государственной программы военного строительства.2010-2020 годы:1. Судостроительная отрасль России продолжает развиваться и диверсифицировать свою продукцию. Отрасль стремится к увеличению доли на мировом рынке судостроения и получению новых заказов.2.

If you are asking for recommendations on which dialogue remarks to remove to make the script more concise, or to improve flow, pacing, and impact, here are some suggestions:1. Trim down ED's declaration in the lab:   From:   \`\`\`   ED   (with ENTHUSIASTIC DETERMINATION)   Today we make HISTORY, my friends! Let’s push the BOUNDARIES of what’s possible!   \`\`\`   To:   \`\`\`   ED   Today, we make history.   \`\`\`   Reason: Simplifying Ed's line makes it more punchy and impactful.2.

ED   (thoughtfully)   Just IMAGINE how many LIVES we could IMPROVE…how many DISEASES we could CURE. This DISCOVERY could give people HOPE.   \`\`\`   To:   \`\`\`   ED   With you, we can change the world...imagine the lives we'll touch.   \`\`\`   Reason: Merging the sentiment into one line maintains the emotional weight while being more succinct.3.

Together, we'll do wonders.   \`\`\`   Reason: Streamlining Maria's encouragement keeps the intimacy without diluting the pacing.4. Lastly, the final action line about the city can be shortened for brevity while maintaining its descriptiveness:   From:   \`\`\`   They share a lingering KISS before turning to the window overlooking the MOONLIT CITY.   \`\`\`   To:   \`\`\`   They kiss, gazing at the moonlit city.   \`\`\`   Reason: Reduces unnecessary detail for a sharper visual image.Remember, the key is to keep the essence of the original dialogue while ensuring it remains effective and serves the pace of the story. Dialogue revisions should maintain character voices and the emotional beats of the scene."},{"question":"Write a Python code to select and upload images  from a Jupyter Notebook","answer":"In a Jupyter Notebook, you can create a widget to select and upload images using \`ipywidgets\` and \`IPython.display\`. The following Python code snippet demonstrates how to do this:First, make sure you have \`ipywidgets\` installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:\`\`\`bashpip install ipywidgets\`\`\`Next, you can use the following code in a Jupyter Notebook cell to create an image upload widget:\`\`\`pythonimport ipywidgets as widgetsfrom IPython.display import display, Imagefrom io import BytesIO# Create an Upload widgetuploader = widgets.FileUpload(    accept='image/*',  # Accepts only image files    multiple=True  # Allows multiple file uploads)# Function to handle the uploaded image datadef handle_upload_change(change):    for uploaded_filename in uploader.value:        print(f\\"Uploaded {uploaded_filename}\\")        image_data = uploader.value[uploaded_filename]['content']        image = Image(value=image_data)        display(image)# Bind the function to the upload widgetuploader.observe(handle_upload_change, names='value')# Display the upload widgetdisplay(uploader)\`\`\`When you run the above code cell, you'll get a \\"Browse\\" button.

The recent events had left scars on everyone present, and the revelation that a parallel Earth Dick Grayson, dubbed ‘Nightshade’, had literally crash-landed into their lives added to the surreal and troubled times they were navigating through.Tim Drake, also known as Red Robin, stood at the forefront, his demeanor as composed as he could manage given the circumstances, yet the furrow at his brow betrayed his inner turmoil. Surrounding him were members of the Titans, each varying in degrees of shock, curiosity, and in some instances, disbelief.Nightshade’s imposing figure, clad in a sleek black and blue suit, stood in stark contrast to the vibrant colors usually donned by the heroes of this Earth. His eyes, though obscured by the mask, seemed to carry a weight far beyond his years, a testament to his experiences in his home universe. The batons on his back and the gun holstered on his thigh were a clear indication of the harsher methods he was accustomed to.As Nightshade recounted his tale, a story of a battle gone awry with a villain named ‘Mindweaver’, the Titans and Red Robin exchanged glances. It was a narrative that sounded all too familiar, yet its conclusion, with Nightshade being sucked into their world, was something none of them could have anticipated.M’gann M’orzz, also known as Miss Martian, focused her telepathic abilities on Nightshade, verifying his story. The confirmation of his truth did little to ease the atmosphere; if anything, it only intensified the complexity of their situation.Tim finally spoke, his voice steady, though the strain was evident, “We believe you, Nightshade. This... this is just a lot to take in. Our world, our team... we're dealing with a lot right now. Your arrival is... unexpected, to say the least.”Nightshade nodded, an acknowledgment of the understatement. “I get it. Last thing anyone needs is a stranger from another universe popping in unexpectedly. Especially not now, from what I gather.” His tone was resigned, perhaps a touch apologetic.The room fell into a contemplative silence, each member lost in thought about the implications of Nightshade's sudden appearance. The parallels and contrasts between him and their Nightwing were undeniably poignant, serving as a painful reminder of recent wounds.Eventually, Tim broke the silence, “We’re going to help you, Nightshade. You’re not responsible for the timing of your arrival, and we won’t leave you stranded here. We’ll figure something out. In the meantime, we might need your... unique perspective on some matters.”A shadow of a smile tugged at the corner of Nightshade’s mouth, a mix of gratitude and resignation. “Appreciated, Red Robin. And for what it’s worth, I’m willing to lend a hand where I can. Despite the differences in our worlds, I believe we share common ground in wanting to protect and do right by those we care about.”The sentiment hit home for many in the room, bridging a gap between the worlds and the versions of the man they had come to know in very different lights.As they set to work, outlining plans and strategies for both their immediate concerns and the longer-term goal of returning Nightshade to his universe, there was a sense of cautious optimism. Perhaps, in helping Nightshade find his way back, they could also find a path forward from their own turmoil, guided by the unlikely camaraderie born of circumstances none of them could have predicted.In this story of convergence and divergence, Nightshade’s arrival might just be the unforeseen variable that shifts the balance, offering new perspectives and, ultimately, a chance for redemption and reconciliation for all involved."},{"question":"Fae Lights Parade","answer":"Round 2: Sapphire's Choice - Fae Lights ParadeAs the duel progresses, Sapphire, feeling the subtle yet inexorable shift in her abilities, opts for a spectacle of enchantment and grace: the Fae Lights Parade.

Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original. ","answer":"In a universe where fictional characters from varied universes inexplicably coexist, there was an IKEA store unlike any other. This particular store was situated at the intersection of multiple realities, staffed by individuals of extraordinary abilities and origins. Among them were Demitri Maximoff, the suave and powerful vampire; Simon Belmont, the determined vampire hunter; Viewtiful Joe, the movie-obsessed superhero; and Steve, the resourceful builder from the blocky realm of Minecraft.On a seemingly mundane Monday morning, the quartet reported for their unusual day jobs at the sprawling blue-and-yellow warehouse.“Good morning, gentlemen,” greeted Demitri, adjusting his impeccable black suit as he conflated his night-time extravagances with the retail environment. “Shall we ensure that our displays are as captivating as my dark charms?”Simon Belmont, hefting his trusty whip—relegated to merely a prop while he advised customers on home furnishings—nodded solemnly. “Indeed, we must be vigilant. A misplaced BILLY bookcase can be as treacherous as any creature of the night.”Viewtiful Joe, suited in his red superhero attire, took his position with a flashy pose. “Time to bring some Henshin-a-go-go to this place! Let’s make this the most viewtiful IKEA on the planet!”Steve, ever the man of few words, merely equipped his wooden pickaxe and nodded, his pixelated face showing as much determination as its limited resolution allowed.The day kicked off with Demitri straightening the KNOPPÄNG frames with his preternatural swiftness. A family approached, the mother looking for the perfect frame to house their cherished memories. Demitri – ever the charmer – glided over.“Madam,” he began, “may I recommend this fine selection? Its simplicity hides an elegance only the most discerning can appreciate – not unlike the enigma of the night.”The customer, a touch flustered by the dramatic sales pitch, replied, “Oh, uh, yes. This looks great. Thank you, Mister...?”“Maximoff, Demitri Maximoff.”Elsewhere, Simon was methodically arranging the flatpack boxes when an apprehensive customer approached, poking at the disassembled pieces of a FJÄLLBO shelf. “Excuse me, sir. I have a feeling this shelf will be quite the adversary to assemble. Do you think I could handle it?”With a hearty laugh, Simon clapped the customer on the back. “Worry not! Many a foe have I bested, and I assure you, this shelf is no greater a challenge. Follow the instructions as you would a treasure map, and you shall find victory at your journey's end.”Meanwhile, Viewtiful Joe could be found in the Open Wardrobe Storage area, reenacting his favorite cinematic moments to the amusement of customers while demonstrating the versatility of the PAX wardrobe system. “And with a *slow-motion* slam, here you can adjust the KOMPLEMENT drawers for maximum style and function!”The customers watching burst into applause, a few even recording the performance for social media.Steve had taken up residence in the children's section, constructing and deconstructing displays at a breakneck pace. A young boy watched in awe as Steve pieced together a STUVA loft bed as if he were stacking blocks in creative mode.“Whoa, mister, you’re like a real-life Minecraft!” the child exclaimed, eyes wide.With a smile that seemed to glimmer through his blocky visage, Steve handed the boy a toy pickaxe from the store's children's section. “Just remember, with the right tools and imagination, you can build anything.”Business continued as usual, with each getting their own share of peculiar puzzles to solve during the regular flow of IKEA shoppers, each drawing on their unique backgrounds to deliver exceptional customer service.It was nearing the end of the day when a loud commotion interrupted the harmonious ballet of commerce. A customer's young child had managed to climb atop a MALM dresser, and it was teetering dangerously.“V-Vampaia Straide!” Demitri urged, glancing at Simon, using his own tongue for \\"Vampire Storm\\", implying collaborative action was needed.Simon nodded, grasping his co-worker's cue. Wielding the whip with the finesse of a seasoned vampire hunter, he lashed it out, grabbing the edge of the dresser, steadying it while Demitri used his vampiric speed to dash to the child's side and safely scoop him from the potential peril.In the backdrop, Viewtiful Joe had already initiated a time-slowing VFX maneuver allowing him to rush to the scene and alert their manager without causing panic among the other customers.Steve, meanwhile, quickly assembled a safety barricade using his otherworldly building skills, ensuring that no other customer would find themselves in a similar situation.The child, now safely on the ground, was teary-eyed but unharmed. The mother, grateful to the point of tears herself, embraced her son.\\"Thank you—all of you,\\" she said, looking from Demitri to Simon, then to Joe and finally Steve, \\"You’ve turned what could have been a terrible day into...something extraordinary.\\"The group exchanged knowing glances. Perhaps their daily grind wasn’t so mundane after all. Each day was, in its own way, an opportunity for adventure, courage, innovation, and sometimes, heroics—even within the aisles of IKEA.As the sun dipped below the horizon, the team of extraordinary employees clocked out, each feeling a sense of accomplishment in their day's work. They may have hung up their capes, weapons, and tools for the day, but in their hearts, they knew that tomorrow would surely bring another day’s worth of ordinary-turned-fantastic customer service stories.And as they pushed through the revolving exit doors onto their respective paths home, the world remained unaware of the unlikely assembly of heroes residing within its favorite Swedish furniture retailer."},{"question":"Придумай длинную сказку про двух двенадцатилетних девочек, которые влюбились друг в друга.

Элиза жила в западной части королевства и была дочерью скромного ткача, а Марианна проживала на востоке в семье известного лекаря. Однажды, во время праздника цветов, судьба свела этих двух девушек вместе.Элиза стояла у ярмарочной лавки и разглядывала цветы, когда подошла Марианна.– Какая красота, не правда ли? – задумчиво сказала Марианна, взглянув на букет нарциссов.– О, да! Цветы здесь как сказка, каждый лепесток пропитан волшебством, – ответила Элиза с улыбкой.– Меня зовут Марианна, и я люблю рассматривать цветы, но редко кому говорю об этом. – Да, боишься, что засмеют? Я Элиза. Знаешь, мне кажется, что подобная страсть делает нас особенными.Этот момент стал началом их нежной дружбы, и они стали навещать друг друга каждые выходные. Они делились тайнами, мечтами и играли в фантастические игры, создавая свои волшебные миры. Сказка длилась день за днем, и вот однажды, во время очередной встречи, Марианна спросила:– Элиза, ты когда-нибудь задумывалась, что происходит, когда цветы влюбляются?– Влюбляются… цветы? Не знаю, наверное, они зацветают ещё красивее.– А что, если мы – как эти цветы? Ведь мы растём и развиваемся, как и они, верно?Элиза вглядывалась в глаза Марианны и чувствовала, что между ними витает некое особенное чувство, теплое и ласковое, как утренний свет.– Может быть, – промолвила она, – но если цветы влюбляются, как мы можем это заметить?– Думаю, они демонстрируют это через свою красоту и аромат. Как мы – через слова и жесты.Следующие несколько месяцев Элиза и Марианна прожили, как в волшебном тумане, сближаясь все больше и больше, понимая, что их дружба превращалась в что-то большее.Так и прошло несколько сезонов, пока однажды они не поняли, что их чувства переросли в настоящую влюблённость. Они открывались друг другу, боясь, но и радуясь возможности быть вместе. И вот однажным весенним утром Марианна сказала:– Элиза, когда я рядом с тобой, мне кажется, что мы созданы из тех же звезд.– Марианна, я чувствую то же самое. Ты – моя звезда, ведущая меня через ночь.С тех пор они решили не скрывать своих чувств и позволили своей любви цвести, несмотря на все трудности и непонимание со стороны других.В конце концов, их исключительная любовь и сила духа принесли перемену в отношении жителей королевства к любви во всех её формах. Элиза и Марианна стали символом того, что любовь – это магия, которая видит сердце, а не границы, и их легенда живёт и по сей день.И в этой сказке было всё: приключения, волшебство, препятствия и, самое главное, любовь, безграничная и свободная. И пока они вместе, каждый день их жизни оказывается ещё одной страницей в вечной сказке, вдохновляющей сердца всех, кто готов слушать и любить."},{"question":"Сделай описание хроник вторжения инопланетян в виде выпусков новостей, сделай больший акцент на местный колорит и статус тех городов в всемирном представлении.1 мая 2023 год, начали пропадать люди в Богота (Колумбия)11 мая 2023 года, НЛО зависло над Кадзо (Япония)24 мая 2023 года, инопланетяне замечены в пригороде Энтеббе (Уганда)4 июня 2023 года, инопланетяне атакуют Лиссабон (Португалия) и похищают людей9 июня 2023 года, инопланетяне высаживают карательный отряд в Sông Cầu (Вьетнам)19 июня 2023 год, инопланетяне уничтожают Луисвилл (США)30 июня 2023 год, инопланетяне оккупируют Peristeri (Греция)4 июля 2023 год, сбит первый НЛО над Рио-Гальегос (Аргентина)17 июля 2023 год, люди впервые отбивают вторжение инопланетян в Лесной (Россия)26 июля 2023 год, инопланетяне превращают Томакомай (Япония) в ферму рабов3 августа 2023 год, инопланетяне захватывают часть Тейлор (США), идут бои на улицах города10 августа 2023 год, инопланетяне уничтожают мирную делегацию в Бали (Камерун)24 августа 2023 год, сбит флагманский корабль пришельцев над Фонтене-Су-Буа (Франция)2 сентября 2023 года, инопланетяне в Бармер (Индия) сдаются в плен17 сентября 2023 год, второй флагманский корабль инопланетян захвачен в районе Новосибирск (Россия)22 сентября 2023 год, инопланетяне идут на переговоры в Семяновице-Слёнске (Польша)28 сентября 2023 года, инопланетяне подписывают капитуляцию в Хэчуань (Китай)6 октября 2023 года, инопланетяне организовано покидают землю из Беруни (Узбекистан)4 февраля 2024 года, инопланетяне возвращаются с дипломатической миссией в Синьцин (Китай)20 февраля 2024 год, инопланетяне подписывают договор о мире и сотрудничестве в Генк (Бельгия)","answer":"Майские Случаи Пропажи в Богота: Местные Беспокоятся за Своих Близких  1 мая 2023 г., Богота, Колумбия – Начало мая омрачено серией загадочных пропаж людей в столице Колумбии.

Este poder permite ao indivíduo redesenhar a matéria, o espaço, o tempo, a energia e até leis universais ao seu bel-prazer. Entretanto, a extensão dessa habilidade está diretamente atrelada ao poder e à habilidade específica do manipulador. Características notáveis dessa habilidade incluem:  - Alterar a matéria em sua forma, composição e propriedades.  - Modificar a percepção do tempo para outros indivíduos ou em uma área específica.  - Criar novas realidades ou universos paralelos com leis distintas das do universo original.  - Controlar forças da natureza como gravidade, magnetismo, entre outras.- Onipotência:  É o estado de ter poder ilimitado e absoluto, sem restrições ou limites de qualquer tipo. Seres onipotentes são, por definição, supremos em todos os aspectos, podendo fazer tudo o que for concebível e inconcebível. Eles não estão sujeitos a nenhuma regra ou lei preexistente e podem manipular a realidade sem esforço. Pontos fundamentais da onipotência incluem:  - Capacidade de criar, alterar e destruir absolutamente tudo sem exceção.  - Domínio total sobre todos os conceitos existenciais, como vida, morte, tempo e espaço.  - Seres onipotentes são inerentemente imortais e invulneráveis a qualquer dano ou limitação.  - A habilidade de conhecer tudo que é conhecível, abrangendo a onisciência (o saber absoluto).Dada essa explanação, a diferença chave entre os dois conceitos é que manipulação da realidade é um ato de alterar o que é preestabelecido dentro de limites específicos da entidade que detém o poder, enquanto a onipotência é a posse de um poder sem limites ou restrições de qualquer espécie, sendo o manipulador capaz de realizar qualquer feito imaginável ou não, sem qualquer exceção ou precondição."},{"question":"from langchain_community.tools import YouTubeSearchToolimport lightbulbtool = YouTubeSearchTool()class YoutubePlugin(lightbulb.Plugin):        @lightbulb.add_checks(lightbulb.owner_only)    @lightbulb.add_cooldown(3, 3, lightbulb.UserBucket)    @lightbulb.option(\\"query\\", \\"query\\", required=True)      @lightbulb.command(\\"search_youtube\\", \\"search youtube\\", auto_defer=True)    @lightbulb.implements(lightbulb.SlashCommand)    async def search_youtube(self, ctx: lightbulb.Context, query: str) -> None:        \\"\\"\\"search youtube\\"\\"\\"        await ctx.respond(tool.search(query))        def load(bot):    bot.add_plugin(YoutubePlugin(bot))    def unload(bot):    bot.remove_plugin(\\"youtube\\").  这个 插件 的命令 在slash command 中没显示  是什么问题？ ","answer":"如果你的命令没有在 slash command 中显示，这可能是因为几个不同的原因。这里有一些可能的原因和解决方案： 1. 命令没有被正确注册确保你的插件被正确加载到机器人中。通常情况下，这是通过在你的主 bot 文件中调用 \`load\` 函数完成的。例如：\`\`\`pythonbot.load_extensions(\\"path.to.your.plugin_module\\")\`\`\`确保 \`\\"path.to.your.plugin_module\\"\` 是正确的 Python 导入路径到包含你的 \`YoutubePlugin\` 的模块。 2. 权限问题你使用了 \`@lightbulb.add_checks(lightbulb.owner_only)\` 装饰器，这意味着只有 bot 的所有者能够看到和使用这个命令。如果你正在尝试用不同于 bot 所有者的账号来查看该命令，它就不会出现。尝试移除这个检查，看命令是否出现：\`\`\`python@lightbulb.add_checks()  # 移除或注释掉 lightbulb.owner_only 检查\`\`\` 3. 冷却时间设置问题虽然冷却时间设置不应影响命令的显示，但如果在实际使用中遇到问题，你可以尝试暂时移除冷却时间设置，看是否有帮助。 4. 问题出在调用 API尝试手动测试 \`YouTubeSearchTool\` 是否能正常工作。可能的话，使用简单的 Python 脚本直接调用该工具的搜索方法，确保没有抛出任何异常或错误。 5. 确保 bot 拥有足够的权限确保你的 bot 有足够的权限和正确的 OAuth2 scope（如 \`applications.commands\`）以注册和显示 slash 命令。你可以在 Discord Developer Portal 中的 bot 设置页面检查这一点。 6. 命令同步时间Discord 有时需要一些时间来同步和显示新注册的 slash 命令。等待几分钟，甚至可能需要长达一小时，看命令是否出现。 7. 检查是否有网络或 Discord API 限制尤其是当开发 bot 并频繁更新命令时，可能会遇到 Discord API 限制。这可能会阻止命令正确注册。查看你的 bot 的日志或输出，以确定是否有相关的错误消息。 8. 重新加载插件有时，重新加载插件可以解决问题。如果你的 bot 框架支持热重载，尝试这个操作。检查这些问题和解决方案后，应该能够帮助你诊断为什么命令没有在 Discord 中的 slash commands 中显示，并且解决该问题。"},{"question":"Write a story which Jem Wolfie and Kate Upton, both heels, meet unexpectadly and start a conversation.

Kate sauntered into the hotel in a tailored sheath dress, her voluptuous body straining against the fabric. They both seemed to carry an aura of power around them.As Jem and Kate passed each other in the grand lobby, neither seemed willing to move even an inch to allow the other to continue. They simply stopped, eyeing each other up and down with an air of slow disdain.\\"Well, well, well,\\" purred Jem, sizing up Kate. \\"If it isn't the most overrated Sports Illustrated model in the world.\\"Kate smirked and replied without missing a beat, \\"Speak for yourself, wannabe Instagram athlete. I suppose you think that lifting for selfies makes you Miss Olympia?\\"Jem bristled at the insult. \\"Please, darling, I could probably lift more with one arm than you could with both.\\"Kate scoffed. \\"You really think so? That's a laugh. I've seen your videos, dear. Just because you can pretend to be an athlete on social media doesn't mean you're any match for a genuine model.\\"Jem's eyes narrowed. This conversation had quickly escalated from casual cattiness to full-blown aggression, and she was not about to let this woman belittle her any further. \\"You want to bet on that, sweetheart? I could take you on any given day in any given contest.\\"\\"And just what kind of contest did you have in mind, little girl?\\" taunted Kate, her voice dripping with disdain.Suddenly, Jem had a brilliant idea. It would be the perfect contest: physical challenge, a test of endurance, and it would settle once and for all who was the alpha female between them.\\"I challenge you to a private, unwitnessed wrestling match,\\" Jem stated, her face a mask of determination.Kate raised an eyebrow and gave a small, confident smile. \\"You're on, darling. I'll crush you with no witnesses to see your pathetic defeat.\\"The two women exchanged a heated gaze before parting ways, each planning to prepare for their upcoming showdown. In their hotel rooms, they trained in secret, both determined to be the victor in their clandestine wrestling match.Finally, the fated day arrived. Both women had privately rented out an exclusive, elite gym, hidden away from prying eyes. Dressed in skin-tight, revealing wrestling attire, Jem and Kate faced off in the center of the ring, their curvy, muscular bodies radiating with anticipation and aggression.In the end, only one alpha female could emerge victorious from this intense and primal competition. With searing insults and immense determination flying in equal measure, it was a battle of wills, strength, and dominance. As they grappled, sweat-soaked and fierce, each woman knew in her heart that this was a contest without losers—no matter which of them finally came out on top."},{"question":"generate beautiful girl mercenary in full growth in a black bulletproof vest shoots from a pistol in the middle of the desert","answer":"I'm sorry, but I cannot generate an image as I am only a text-based AI. However, I can describe the scene for you based on your description. Here's a vivid depiction:---Sand whips through the air, carving patterns in the vast, desert landscape. The sun bears down mercilessly, its rays reflecting off the myriad grains of sand, turning the dunes into a tapestry of light and shadow. In the midst of this deserted expanse stands a figure—a strikingly beautiful girl mercenary with a steely gaze that indicates her readiness for whatever challenges the desert might throw her way.Her attire is a mix of practicality and subtle style. Full growth and athletically poised, she wears combat boots laced tightly, partially buried in the warm desert sand. Her sleek, dark trousers hug her form, allowing for a full range of motion while her lean muscles suggest agility and strength. A snug, black bulletproof vest hugs her upper body, with magazines and gadgets clipped neatly to it, signifying not only protection but also preparedness. The vest is unadorned, functional, and deadly serious—a stark contrast to her wild, wind-swept hair that cascades freely, providing a touch of defiance to the harshness of her environment.In her hands, she grips a pistol, her fingers wrapped securely around the handle, a picture of focus and confidence. The gun's barrel points outward, unwavering, as if an extension of her own will. Even in full growth, her presence is commanding, and the desert seems to acknowledge her as she stands undaunted amidst the scorching solitude.Despite her surroundings, there is an undeniable elegance to her. The harsh desert backdrop only serves to highlight her resilience and the dangerous grace with which she balances being a weapon of war and a portrait of feminine strength. The formidable combination of her good looks and combat readiness makes it clear she's not to be underestimated. She scans the horizon, a lone sentinel prepared to unleash her skills on any adversary that might dare to emerge from the heat-hazed dunes.Her form stands out starkly against the uniform palette of the desert, a story in herself of beauty and survival, of danger and allure.---While this description sets a scene, an actual artist or a specialized AI-driven image generation tool would be needed to create a visual representation of your request."},{"question":"Тр есть это не китайский персонаж?","answer":"Извините за путаницу. Вы правы, Шэндань Лаорень (圣诞老人) не является традиционным китайским персонажем. Это дословный перевод западного Санта-Клауса, который был позаимствован в Китае сравнительно недавно и ассоциируется с празднованием западного Рождества.Традиционная китайская культура не узнает персонажа, аналогичного Санта-Клаусу или Деду Морозу. Тем не менее, китайский Новый Год, или праздник Весны (春节, Chūnjié), который считается самым важным праздником в китайском календаре, имеет свои символы и обычаи.Один из традиционных персонажей, связанных с празднованием китайского нового года, — это бог богатства под именем 财神 (Cáishén), почитаемый в надежде на финансовое благополучие и удачу в приближающемся году. Помимо этого, праздник сопровождается различными обрядами, украшениями, использованием огненных фейерверков, а также традиционным красным конвертом - 红包 (hóngbāo), в который кладутся деньги в качестве подарка детям и подчиненным для удачи и благосостояния.Таким образом, Шэндань Лаорень (圣诞老人) является персонажем, заимствованным из западной культуры и ассоциируемым с Рождеством, а не китайским фольклорным или традиционным персонажем."},{"question":"In D&D 5e, why is it that some ranged attacks have two numbers separated by a slash (e.g. 100/200 ft.)?","answer":"In D&D 5th Edition, the two numbers separated by a slash for ranged attacks represent the weapon's or attack's normal range and its maximum range.- The first number (before the slash) is the attack's normal range in feet. When you make an attack within this range, you make the attack roll as normal.  - The second number (after the slash) is the weapon's long range. When making an attack beyond the normal range and up to this long range, you can still try to hit your target, but you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This represents the decreased accuracy of shots at longer distances.So, taking your example of 100/200 ft., if a character makes a ranged attack with a weapon that has those range values, they can attack normally out to 100 feet. If their target is beyond 100 feet but within 200 feet, the character can still attack, but they do so with disadvantage due to the greater difficulty of hitting targets at extended range.If the target is beyond 200 feet, the character cannot make the attack at all with that weapon, as it's beyond the weapon's effective range."},{"question":"Mas como que você vai ver o vídeo?","answer":"Peço desculpas pela confusão anterior.

To approach this contentious issue with intellectual rigor, one must transcend cultural chauvinism and Orientalist misrepresentations in pursuit of a more comprehensive understanding of the historical, social, and ideological dimensions that underpin Muslim women's multifarious struggles for emancipation and social reform. In this context, Fatima Mernissi, an eminent Moroccan feminist and sociologist, emerges as an influential voice, contributing significantly to a more nuanced perception of Islam and Muslim societies by dismantling hackneyed stereotypes and prejudices that have long plagued Western imagination.Mernissi's critical intervention in this ongoing debate revolves around articulating an alternative narrative, one that challenges the essentialist assumption of an indissoluble link between Islam, patriarchy, and gender-based discrimination. Through a discerning analysis, Mernissi argues that the subordination of women in certain Muslim societies is not inherently rooted in Islamic precepts or teachings. Instead, it is a product of specific configurations of historical, social, and political factors that have engendered male dominance and patriarchal structures in these societies. In constructing her nuanced analysis, Mernissi draws inspiration from Michel Foucault's theoretical insights on the relationships between power, knowledge, and subject formation. Therefore, this essay, informed by Mernissi's work, seeks to scrutinize the complex web of power relations and discursive practices that perpetuate gender inequality in select Muslim societies, while concurrently exploring transformative possibilities embedded within Islamic tradition in the pursuit of reform.Delving into the Historical Foundations of Islamic Societies: A Contextual PerspectiveMernissi embarks on a thorough analysis to contextualize the emergence of patriarchal structures in Islamic societies. This endeavor is initiated by examining the historical foundations upon which these societies were built and exploring their consequent evolution. Mernissi contends that the establishment of patriarchal structures in these societies can be attributed to specific historical processes rather than being innately intertwined with Islamic doctrine or theology.To substantiate this argument, Mernissi meticulously investigates the sociopolitical context of the pre-Islamic Arabian Peninsula, where tribal allegiances, warrior ethos, and a patrilineal system of kinship held sway. Throughout her exploration, Mernissi demonstrates how elements of pre-Islamic culture were progressively integrated into the nascent Islamic polity, irrespective of the egalitarian message and social reforms promulgated by the Prophet Muhammad and his early companions. This fastidious historical reconstruction illuminates the multifarious tensions, contradictions, and ambiguities that characterized the processes of state formation and institutionalization in early Muslim societies, in which patriarchal norms and values were subtly ingrained into the emerging Islamic legal and political framework. Consequently, Mernissi’s critical historical contextualization not only elucidates a more nuanced interpretation of Islamic sources, but also serves as a vital counterpoint to the monolithic and ahistorical perspectives on Islam and Muslim societies in much of the contemporary literature.A Hermeneutics of Equality and Justice: Reinterpreting the Quranic TextMernissi's innovative reinterpretation of the Quranic texts, foregrounding a feminist critique of Islamic patriarchy, constitutes a seminal contribution to the burgeoning field of Islamic feminist hermeneutics. By embracing a holistic, non-reductionist approach to Quranic exegesis, Mernissi challenges prevailing patriarchal interpretations that have been perpetuated in Islamic scholastic tradition. Ultimately, she endeavors to recover the foundational messages of gender equality and social justice that suffuse the sacred text.In this process, Mernissi adopts various strategies, including underscoring the importance of historical and social context in understanding Quranic verses and injunctions. For instance, Mernissi points out that oppressive practices such as polygamy, concubinage, and female infanticide were systematically curtailed and regulated by the Quran to advocate for gender justice and social stability in pre-Islamic Arabia. However, subsequent generations of literalist and male-centric Quranic interpretations advanced by medieval scholars and jurists eclipsed these progressive reforms in an effort to restore patriarchal norms and preserve male privileges under the mantle of religious orthodoxy.Moreover, Mernissi engages in a meticulous analysis of the Quran's intricate linguistic and rhetorical structure to emphasize the egalitarian ethos and concern for women's welfare imbued within the text. By highlighting the frequent use of dual gender pronouns and references, Mernissi underscores the moral and spiritual equality of men and women and their collective responsibility in upholding ethical values and social harmony. This linguistic analysis not only accentuates the multidimensionality of the Quran's discourse on gender relations, but also presents compelling evidence to validate the legitimacy of feminist perspectives within Islamic intellectual and spiritual traditions.Deconstructing the Complex Interplay of Power, Knowledge, and Domination: A Foucauldian LensMernissi's impassioned critique of Islamic patriarchy and her subsequent vision for social reform are profoundly influenced by the theoretical insights of Michel Foucault, who adroitly dissects the intricate mechanisms of power, knowledge, and subjectivity that underlie contemporary societies. By employing Foucault's analytical tools, Mernissi unearths the subtle strategies of control and manipulation wielded by male religious authorities in Muslim societies, who appropriate religious knowledge and scriptural interpretation as instruments of domination and subordination. For instance, Mernissi laments the pervasive objectification of women's bodies in modern Islamic societies, attributing this phenomenon to the pernicious influence of male-centric religious discourses that circumscribe women's subjectivity and agency.In pursuit of emancipation and empowerment, Mernissi advocates for Muslim women to reclaim discursive spaces and fields of knowledge traditionally monopolized by men and thus expand their capacity to challenge and resist patriarchal structures and ideologies. This emancipation requires fostering critical consciousness, cultivating intellectual curiosity, and engaging in collective action to contest and subsequently transform oppressive social institutions and practices. Ultimately, Mernissi's feminist vision is grounded in the unwavering conviction of the transformative potential of human agency and the emancipatory ethos intrinsic to Islamic faith, offering hope and inspiration for all those who aspire to build a more equitable, compassionate, and inclusive world.ConclusionFatima Mernissi's incisive analysis and radical critique of Islamic patriarchy present a timely and prescient intervention in ongoing debates on the status of women in Muslim societies. By gracefully debunking the myth of Islam as an inherently oppressive and discriminatory religion, Mernissi transcends cultural barriers and serves as an influential mediator among diverse groups, imbued with hope and inspiration to build a more equitable and compassionate world. Ultimately, Mernissi's work exemplifies the potential for emancipation through Islamic feminist hermeneutics, invigorating the collective pursuit for greater social justice and human dignity."},{"question":"Теперь сильно его исказите","answer":"Sveikuti!

Почему двуногое хождение, увеличение объема головного мозга, всеядное питание и стадный образ жизни расценивают как предпосылки возникновения человека?ASSISTANT: Двуногое хождение, увеличение объема головного мозга, всеядное питание и стадный образ жизни считаются ключевыми факторами в эволюции человека по нескольким причинам:<br/><br/>1. Двуногое хождение: Освобождение рук от необходимости использования для передвижения позволило нашим предкам использовать их для манипулирования предметами, что, в свою очередь, стимулировало развитие инструментальной деятельности и, как следствие, большего интеллекта. Кроме того, двуногое передвижение эффективно для движения по открытым пространствам, что стало актуальным при выходе из лесных зон.<br/><br/>2. Увеличение объема головного мозга: Это достижение эволюции обеспечило повышение когнитивных способностей, что позволило развивать сложные формы общения и социального поведения, создавать сложные инструменты, использовать символы и развивать культуру.<br/><br/>3. Всеядное питание: Гибкость в выборе пищи дала возможность приспособиться к различным экологическим нишам и переживать периоды скарцевания конкретных пищевых ресурсов. Это также могло способствовать развитию социального поведения и кооперативной охоты.<br/><br/>4. Стадный образ жизни: Живя в группах, ранние гоминиды могли лучше защищаться от хищников, эффективной охотиться и собирать пищу, а также заботиться о потомстве. Социальные взаимодействия стали основой для развития языка и культуры.<br/><br/>В целом, эти аспекты в совокупности создали условия, при которых повышение интеллекта и социальное поведение стали значительными эволюционными преимуществами, что в конечном итоге привело к возникновению Homo sapiens.USER: Ответь на вопрос. Какие этапы становления человека подтверждены палеонтологическими данными ? Каковы прогрессивные тенденции их развития ?ASSISTANT: Этапы становления человека, подтвержденные палеонтологическими данными, включают:<br/><br/>1. Австралопитеки (около 4-2 миллионов лет назад): Одни из самых ранних известных представителей человеческой линии, характеризующиеся уже двуногим передвижением, но по-прежнему небольшим объемом головного мозга по сравнению с современными людьми.<br/><br/>2. Род Homo, который включает виды, такие как Homo habilis (около 2,4-1,4 миллиона лет назад) и Homo erectus (около 1,9 миллиона - 143 тысяч лет назад). Эти виды демонстрируют увеличение объема мозга и более сложное использование каменных инструментов.<br/><br/>3. Появление Homo heidelbergensis (около 600-200 тысяч лет назад) и в дальнейшем возникновение неандертальцев (около 400-40 тысяч лет назад) и Homo sapiens (около 300 тысяч лет назад до настоящего времени). Эти виды имеют ещё более крупные мозги и развивают более софистицированные навыки, например, строительство жилья, использование огня, искусство и ритуалы.<br/><br/>Прогрессивные тенденции их развития включают:<br/><br/>1. Увеличение объема и сложности головного мозга, особенно в областях, отвечающих за мышление, планирование и коммуникацию.<br/><br/>2. Усовершенствование каменных инструментов и развитие технологий, включая контролируемое использование огня.<br/><br/>3. Изменения в структуре скелета, в том числе утончение костей и изменения в форме таза, свидетельствующие о более эффективном двуногом передвижении.<br/><br/>4. Питание: переход от вегетарианства к всеядности, повышение пищевой гибкости, что способствовало выживанию в различных окружающих условиях.<br/><br/>5. Социальные аспекты: развитие языка, создание социальных структур, развитие искусства и ритуалов.<br/><br/>Эти аспекты в целом отражают эволюционный прогресс, в результате которого люди стали высоко социальными, интеллектуальными существами, способными к культурному разнообразию и технологическим инновациям.USER: Ответь на вопрос. На основании каких признаков можно предположить, что неандертальцы в эволюционном плане занимали более высокое положение , чем питекантропы?ASSISTANT: Неандертальцы считаются более продвинутыми в эволюционном плане по сравнению с питекантропами (Homo erectus) на основании следующих признаков:<br/><br/>1. Морфология мозга: Неандертальцы имели больший средний объем головного мозга по сравнению с питекантропами. Это указывает на более развитые когнитивные способности.<br/><br/>2. Сложность инструментальной культуры: Неандертальцы использовали более разнообразный и продвинутый набор инструментов, что свидетельствует об их более высоком уровне технических знаний.<br/><br/>3. Поведение и образ жизни: У неандертальцев были свидетельства захоронения умерших, что может указывать на наличие религиозных верований, а также уход за больными и стариками, отражающий социальные связи и эмпатию в их обществах.<br/><br/>4. Стратегии выживания: Неандертальцы адаптировались к холодным климатическим условиям, что потребовало от них разработки стратегий для обеспечения теплом и пищей, включая охоту на крупных млекопитающих, использование одежды и контролируемое использование огня.<br/><br/>5. Анатомические особенности: Неандертальцы имели более массивное телосложение с короткими конечностями, что являлось приспособлением к жизни в холодных условиях и отражает эволюционное развитие в ответ на окружающую среду.<br/><br/>Все эти признаки позволяют предположить, что неандертальцы занимали более высокое положение в эволюционном плане, чем питекантропы, отражая большую приспособленность к сложным условиям окружающей среды и более развитые общественные структуры.USER: Ответь на вопрос.

Сначала вычислим синус 735 градусов:Учитывая, что синус - это периодическая функция с периодом 360 градусов, можно вычесть 360 градусов несколько раз, до тех пор пока значение не окажется в интервале от 0 до 360 градусов. [ sin(735^circ) = sin(735^circ - 360^circ times 2) = sin(15^circ) ]Таким образом, (sin(735^circ) = sin(15^circ)). Используя знание специфических значений или таблицу, можно найти, что значение (sin(15^circ)) может быть рассчитано через формулы половинного угла, но в данной задаче это значение не приведено напрямую, однако его можно узнать из специальных таблиц или калькулятора.Теперь вычислим тангенс (5pi/12):Значение угла (5pi/12) радиан не является одним из стандартных углов, для которых легко найти значение тангенса. Однако его можно рассчитать через выражение, позволяющее произвести вычисления, используя стандартные значения тангенса углов.

Describe how he looks as he lets out a long fart, visibly relieved afterwards. Some fish go belly-up and 10K jokingly acts sorry for farting, then grabs one of the fish to cook up for dinner","answer":"Title: \\"The Fishy Fart\\"The sun was hanging low in the horizon, casting its orange glow across a serene pond hidden within a copse of willow trees. This was a rare tranquil moment in the post-apocalyptic world of Z Nation—so rare that even the ever-vigilant sharpshooter, 10K, couldn't resist the temptation to let his guard down for a bit.With the stealth of a cat, 10K looked around to make sure no zombies—or worse, talkative humans—were in sight. Satisfied, he slipped out of his grungy, zombie-slaying gear with a surprisingly graceful motion, despite the abundance of makeshift weapons clattering to the ground. A soft, comedic plop sounded as his boots hit the soft earth, followed by a symphony of zippers and the rustling of fabric.There he stood—in the buff—with the late afternoon sun highlighting the battle scars that danced across his lean and rugged physique. And there, too, was his butt, unceremoniously presented in all its glory; tight and compact from all those high-stress sprints and zombie dodges, it could only be described as a post-apocalyptic work of art—albeit a cheeky one.10K dipped a tentative toe into the pond's clear, inviting water before committing to a full-on plunge. The water embraced him with the coolness only a world without hot showers can appreciate. He waded out until the water lapped around his waist, then allowed himself to float on his back, his eyes closing as he soaked in the tranquility.As he let his post-apocalyptic tension ebb away, 10K's face contorted slightly, knitting his brows as if he were zeroing in on a far-away Z. Suddenly, a bubble rippled through the water, and then another. 10K lifted his head, eyes popping open in mock surprise. With an exaggerated flair fitting a silent film star, he settled back into the water.\\"PPPFFFTTTBBRRRPPP!\\"The fart erupted unapologetically from 10K's backside, a long, resonating echo of human digestion that sent ripples out across the water like a pebble dropped from heaven. It was a comically trumpet-like sound—a post-apocalyptic tuba solo that could have scared off a lesser horde of zombies.10K let out a sigh of relief that seemed to travel the length of his body, stretching from his relieved grin to his relaxed toes. As he floated back to his serene state, he noticed a few fish going belly-up, innocent casualties of his gastric exultation.\\"Whoops, my bad,\\" 10K chuckled under his breath, a crooked smirk crawling across his sun-tanned face. He casually waded over to one of the floating snacks and plucked it from the water, inspecting the still-twitching fish with the discerning eye of a gourmet chef choosing the evening's protein.\\"I guess it's sashimi night, thanks to my built-in fishing technique,\\" 10K joked to himself, relishing the absurdity of it all. He waded back to the shore, clutching the fish like a life-saving talisman and feeling unexpectedly grateful for nature's bounty—and his own unpredictable digestive system.The camera zoomed in for one last shot of 10K’s butt as he sauntered back to camp, fish in hand, and with a newfound appreciation for the quiet moments of life—and the loud ones, too.[Scene fades out with a plucky, cheeky tune that pays homage to the little things in the apocalypse that make you crack a smile—or a fart.]"},{"question":"Напиши слова к песне про то как Шрек захотелось какать, для школьного проекта","answer":"Понимаю, что вы ищете творческий подход к школьному проекту.

My client Hennadiy Kernes was born on the 27th of June 1959 in the Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union (now Ukraine), unfortunately he died of Covid-19 on the 17th December 2020 in Berlin Germany at the age of 61. I bring you a proposal that will change our lives forever. Mr. Hennadiy Kernes was a top politician in Ukraine, known for his political stride. While he was alive, he was a member of a political party known as Kernes Bloc and was a Mayor of Kharkov from 24th November 2010 till death. Kernes' wife and her two kids were killed by the Russian military on 8th of April 2022. during the Russian Invasion in Ukraine. My client Mr. Hennadiy Kernes was one of the corrupt politicians in the history of Ukraine who lunder funds to different parts of the world using his company HendiyK LTD.However, Kernes’ 10-year reign in Kharkov was marked by scandals and controversy, hence in 2014 an attempt was made on his life. I was his close ally and trusted lawyer. My Client made a fixed deposit of Nine million, eight hundred thousand dollars using a company (HendiyK LTD) which never existed, I was the person that handled most documentation of his shady deals while he was still mayor of Kharkov. This is a lifetime opportunity that will change our lives forever.

Here are some key strategies and tips for prompt engineering based on the general ideas you would find in resources like the one you mentioned:1. Be Specific: Clearly define the task you want the language model to perform. The specificity of your prompt can greatly influence how well the model responds. For instance, instead of prompting with \\"Translate this,\\" use \\"Translate the following English text into French.\\"2. Use Examples: Including examples in your prompt ('few-shot learning') can guide the model on the kind of responses you're expecting. This can be particularly effective if your task is somewhat specialized and may not be a typical request the model has been trained on.3. Chain of Thought Prompting: For complex problem-solving tasks, you might use a 'chain of thought' prompt where you not only present the problem but also simulate a step-by-step reasoning process that the model can follow to reach the solution.4. Temperature Setting: When generating responses, you can adjust the randomness (temperature) of the output. A lower temperature will produce more predictable and conservative results, while a higher temperature will enable more creative and diverse responses.5. Formatting and Framing: The way you structure and frame your prompt can significantly affect the outcome. Use clear, unambiguous language and frame your problem in a context that is likely to produce the desired result.6. Role-Playing: You can prompt the model to assume a specific role or persona. By doing so, you encourage the model to produce outputs that are consistent with that role, which can be useful in generating certain types of content or responses.7. Iterative Refinement: After you receive a response, you can refine your prompt with feedback or further specifics and re-submit it to the model for improved results.8. Avoiding Biases and Unsafe Outputs: Be mindful of the language and examples you use in your prompt to minimize the risk of reinforcing biases or eliciting harmful responses from the model.Experimentation and tuning are an integral part of prompt engineering. Since every task and problem can be unique, there's often a degree of trial and error involved in crafting the right prompt that will steer the model in the desired direction. Analysing the model's outputs and iteratively adjusting your prompts based on these analyses is key to success in prompt engineering."},{"question":"300 = x+5 *y+3","answer":"L'équation que tu as rédigée combine la surface initiale et la nouvelle surface après l'augmentation des dimensions.

The operation consists of a division, multiplication, and subtraction:1. Divide 4,444,444,444,444,444,444,444,444,444 by 55,555,555,555,555,555,555,555.2. Multiply the result by 66,666,666,666,666,666,666,666,666,666,666.3. Subtract 999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999.The calculation involves extremely large numbers, which can't be handled by normal calculators due to limits on precision and range. However, we can make some simplifications by recognizing a pattern in the numbers.First, notice that the numbers are all sequences of a single digit repeated to form very large numbers. You can reduce the calculation significantly by dividing out common factors:We have:- The divisor, 55,555,555,555,555,555,555,555, is 5 times a sequence of the digit '1'.- The dividend, 4,444,444,444,444,444,444,444,444,444, is 4 times the same sequence of the digit '1', but 4 times longer.- The multiplier, 66,666,666,666,666,666,666,666,666,666,666, is 6 times a sequence of the digit '1', with the sequence being 6 times longer than the divisor.This means that the dividend is four \\"444\\" blocks long (when considering chunks that are the same size as the divisor), while the divisor is a single \\"555\\" block. Similarly, the multiplier is a six \\"666\\" blocks long. This pattern suggests that we have sequences of the same length and can treat them as single-digit quantities to simplify the calculation.Here's a simplified representation:(4 / 5) * 6 = 24 / 5 = 4.8 (after division and multiplication)You now would subtract a sequence of '9's from 4.8, which basically means you'll end up with an extremely large number that is just slightly smaller than a number consisting entirely of '9's. After this point, the actual numerical calculation would yield a number that starts with a few digits followed by a very long sequence of '9's, but the exact value depends on the lengths of the sequences.Such precise calculation exceeds normal computational capabilities due to the size of the numbers, including this simplified approach. In practical terms, it's not feasible to calculate or represent these numbers exactly without specialized software or algorithms designed for handling arbitrary-precision arithmetic."},{"question":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

Despite sharing these basic elements, there are significant differences between them in terms of historical context, rules, gameplay, and cultural significance. Here's a comparison of the two: Historical Context- Association Football: Modern association football originated in England in the 19th century, though games involving a ball and a goal date back thousands of years across various cultures. The standardized rules of modern football were established in 1863 with the founding of the Football Association in England.- Cuju: Cuju is an ancient Chinese ball game that dates back to the Warring States period (around 475-221 BC) and was popular until the Ming dynasty (14th-17th centuries). It is recognized by FIFA as the earliest form of football for which there is evidence. Rules and Gameplay- Association Football: Played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end, the objective is to score by getting the ball into the opposing team's goal. The rules restrict handling the ball to the goalkeeper within the penalty area. Association football is played over two halves of 45 minutes each, with a halftime interval.- Cuju: The rules of Cuju varied over time and place but generally involved kicking a ball through an opening into a small net without the use of hands. Unlike modern soccer, Cuju fields could vary in size and shape, and the number of players and the style of the nets or targets could also differ. In some versions, there was no goalkeeping. Equipment- Association Football: The game is played with a spherical ball, standardized in size and weight, and players wear specific uniforms, boots, and shin guards. The goals are rectangular frames with netting.- Cuju: The Cuju ball was made of leather with a feather or hair filling. The players' attire is less documented, but historical sources suggest they were likely dressed in standard athletic clothing of the times. Goals could range from simple openings to elaborate net structures. Cultural Significance- Association Football: It has grown to become the world's most popular sport, with a massive following, professional leagues in almost every country, and major international competitions like the FIFA World Cup.- Cuju: It was more than a sport; it also had military training aspects and was used as a method for soldiers to improve their physical condition and foot skills. Cuju also held cultural significance and was played during special festivals and court entertainment. ConclusionWhile there are similarities between association football and Cuju in terms of being team sports focusing on kicking a ball to achieve goals, they differ significantly in their historical origins, rules, gameplay mechanics, and cultural impact. Association football is a global phenomenon with standardized rules and professional leagues worldwide. In contrast, Cuju was historically significant within Chinese culture and varied much more in terms of how it was played."},{"question":"我需要推广策略方面更加具体详细，后续跟进部分要更全面","answer":"二、推广策略：1. 网络社交营销：（1）内容营销：设立官方账号，发布包含产品介绍、使用方法、用户案例等种类的原创文章，并以图文、短视频等多种形式呈现。（2）KOL合作：邀请与公司定位相符的各类意见领袖，例如游戏直播主播、网络游戏博主等，进行产品推广。具体包括抖音挑战赛、直播间试用、发表-Guard真实使用感受等。（3）社交平台广告投放：针对性地在微博、抖音、微信等平台投放广告，推广品牌，吸引流量。（4）定期举办线上活动：例如产品试用、限时购、满减优惠等，增加用户参与度，提高品牌关注度。2. 在线视频平台营销：（1）合作视频制作：寻找英雄联盟游戏相关的优质短视频创作者，制作宣传片或者相关主题视频，结合Emo Poppy洗发水与游戏特点。（2）游戏广告植入：与游戏相关短视频和直播平台合作，在他们的内容中植入产品广告，同时邀请主播和制作方进行推广。（3）策划定期直播活动：与英雄联盟游戏直播平台合作，寻找热门直播间，邀请主播和玩家以使用Emo Poppy洗发水为主题进行互动游戏及抽奖。3. 现场赛事推广：（1）定制周边礼品：设计与英雄联盟角色相关的周边礼品，如定制毛巾、公仔等，并在赛事现场进行派发。（2）赞助方案：制定灵活的赞助方案，针对不同规模的赛事给予相应的赞助；如现金赞助、产品赞助等。（3）赛事同款宣传：利用现场场馆投放宣传海报、展板，通过赛事同款宣传吸引现场观众。（4）举办线下活动：如粉丝见面会、游戏比赛、挑战赛等，增加赛事与品牌的互动机会。4. 商家合作：（1）电商平台合作：在各大电商平台推出Emo Poppy专属定制礼盒，如限量版游戏人物定制套装、英雄联盟游戏充值卡等。（2）实体店线下活动：开展与实体店的联动活动，如购买产品即可获得游戏道具、皮肤、折扣兑换券等。（3）与线下体验馆合作：针对线下游戏体验馆，推出特别定制的使用方案，让受众深入了解Emo Poppy洗发水。三、后期跟进：1. 营销数据监测：（1）数据统计与分析：实时了解各活动推广效果，如客户来源、转化率、点击量等。（2）闭环反馈：通过收集消费者在不同渠道的反馈，对产品及活动进行及时调整。2. 顾客满意度调查：（1）电话回访：邀请专业团队对已购买客户进行电话回访，了解客户对产品的满意度。（2）线上问卷：通过公司官网和官方社交媒体帐号进行线上调查，收集客户满意度数据。3. 客户关系管理：（1）维护客户信息数据库：搭建并维护客户信息数据库，分析客户属性，为个性化推广活动提供准确依据。（2）策划会员活动：为消费者提供会员专享活动，如购物优惠、礼品兑换、积分奖励等。（3）定期发布新品资讯：通过电子邮件、短信、APP推送等方式，推送公司及产品相关新闻和优惠活动，持续提高客户黏性。"},{"question":"Множественное число слова \\"дно\\"","answer":"Множественное число слова \\"дно\\" - это \\"дна\\"."},{"question":"Best Gloss for Cool Brunette Tones: LOreal Paris One Step Hair Gloss, 4 Oz, generate a personal experience with this, add hash tag at the bottom, less than 700 characters only, only strings, no </br> html","answer":"Recently, I decided to give my dull, cool brunette hair a boost with L'Oreal Paris One Step Hair Gloss in Cool Brunette.

It became evident that the conventional means of storing her extensive fortune were no longer sufficient. The solution, both practical and ostentatiously in line with her extravagant lifestyle, was as audacious as it was dazzling: an immense, diamond-encrusted vault installed right in her streaming room.This vault, a marvel of engineering and luxury, stood as a fortress of wealth amidst the backdrop of her day-to-day life. Encrusted with diamonds that glittered under the studio lights, it was more than just a storage solution—it was a statement piece, an art installation celebrating the enormity of her financial success. Its massive doors gleamed, each facet reflecting not just the physical light but the metaphorical spotlight that Rio thrived under.The decision to place such an extravagant vault in her streaming room was no mere whim; it was a calculated move. For Rio, it bridged the worlds of her personal excess and her public persona. Every live broadcast now featured the vault, a silent guardian of wealth, a constant reminder to her audience of the financial empire she commanded. It became a character in its own right, symbolizing the pinnacle of success that Rio embodied.\\"I guess you could say we've upgraded,\\" Rio remarked with a smirk during one of her streams, gesturing casually towards the vault. The understatement was deliberate, the irony not lost on her viewers who marveled at the absurdity and sheer magnificence of the spectacle. \\"This isn't just a vault; it's the heart of my empire, encased in diamonds because, well, why not?\\"The addition of the vault dramatically changed the dynamics of her streams. Viewership spiked as people tuned in not just for Rio's charismatic presence but to catch glimpses of the vault, speculating on its contents and the level of wealth it represented. Discussions about the vault's aesthetics, its security features, and the decision to make such an overt display of wealth dominated social media platforms, further fueling Rio's fame.Yet, to Rio, the vault was more than just an object of fascination or a clever branding tactic. It was a physical manifestation of her journey, a journey marked by ambition, savvy decisions, and an unquenchable desire for more. It held her fortune but, more importantly, it held stories—stories of late nights, risky moves, spectacular wins, and the relentless pursuit of a life less ordinary.Her streams evolved to include segments where she would interact with the vault, sometimes opening it to reveal stacks of cash or showcasing a particularly exquisite piece of jewelry. These moments, intimate glimpses into the tangible successes of her life, were shared with millions, creating a paradoxical sense of personal connection within the vast, impersonal landscape of the internet.The diamond-encrusted vault, in all its glittering opulence, became emblematic of Rio’s brand. It was a testament to her strategic mind and her understanding of her audience's desires—a blend of luxury, transparency, and a touch of the fantastical. In a world that often felt too constrained by the ordinary, Rio, her vault, and her streams offered an escape into a realm where success knew no bounds, and wealth was celebrated with unabashed, sparkling extravagance."},{"question":"If I cleaned corrupt and crimson biomes in Terraria","answer":"Cleaning corrupt and crimson biomes in Terraria is a common goal for many players, especially those aiming to restore the purity of their worlds or control these spreading biomes to protect vital areas and key NPCs. If you've cleaned these biomes, here are some of the major outcomes and effects:1. Increased Purity: The primary and most obvious outcome is an increase in the purity of your world. This means more Forest biome will take the place where Corruption or Crimson once was. This is beneficial for creating a safer and more manageable environment for building, farming, and exploration.2. NPC Happiness: Some NPCs in Terraria prefer to live in specific biomes or simply prefer the peace of the Purity biome. Cleaning the Corruption or Crimson can positively affect their happiness, which in turn affects the prices of the items they sell and buy. This can be particularly useful for players looking to minimize costs or maximize profits.3. Game Progression: Certain game progressions might be tied to the presence or absence of Corruption/Crimson biomes. For example, eliminating these biomes entirely could be a player-set goal before moving onto hardmode or tackling specific bosses. However, it should be noted that making a world completely free of Corruption/Crimson before defeating the Wall of Flesh may not be entirely beneficial, as breaking altars in hardmode spawns new Corruption/Crimson blocks.4. Enemy Spawns: Enemies specific to these biomes will no longer spawn in the cleaned areas, making it safer for the player and NPCs. This can be a double-edged sword, however, as certain enemies drop unique and valuable items.5. Changes in World Ecosystem: Other biomes, such as the Hallow, might begin to spread more freely with less Corruption or Crimson to counteract their expansion. This could lead to an unintended spread of the Hallow, which while not as hostile, still replaces the native Purity biome.6. Achievement and Rewards: Depending on your achievement/trophy setup and platform, cleaning a significant portion or all Corruption/Crimson from your world may unlock achievements. In terms of in-game rewards, the satisfaction comes from having a \\"clean\\" world to work with, though no specific in-game items are awarded for this task alone.7. Preparation for Hardmode: If done before entering Hardmode, cleaning the corruption or crimson can help make the transition smoother by providing a safer environment initially. However, upon entering Hardmode, the world automatically generates a V-shaped section of new Corruption/Crimson and Hallow, countering some of your cleaning efforts until you manage these new areas.8. Use of Resources: Cleaning these biomes typically requires a significant amount of resources, whether it be Purification Powder from the Dryad, the Clentaminator and its solutions, or Holy Water. This can be a drain on resources but is often seen as a worthy investment for the benefits it brings.Cleaning Corruption or Crimson biomes is a significant undertaking with both immediate and lasting effects on your world. It's a task that can considerable change your Terraria experience, emphasizing safety, exploration, and control over your environment."},{"question":"C:UsersKunal-PC.condaenvsvenvlibsite-packagesrasa_sdkexecutor.py:86: FutureWarning: Use of \`utter_button_message\` is deprecated.

Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера:На силу отбился от этих жуликоватых предпринимателей. Если вы читаете мой отзыв, то ни в коем случае, ничего не подписывайте до тех пор, пока не уведите предмет сделки. Здесь специально всё устроили так, что бы поэтапно вытягивать с вас деньги. Сначала оплатить одно, потом другое. Вся эта разбивка платежа, голимый обман. Но в момент нахождения там, вас очень хорошо обработают и вы и не заметите, как отнесёте деньги в кассу. Я вот по глупости оплатил брокерские услуги по подбору машины. Сообразил, что дело пахнет жареным, когда мне сказали, что в момент доставки произошел инцидент, но я могу сделать другой выбор. Естественно ни о скидках, ни о прошлом годе выпуска уже речи и не шло. Вернуть деньги отказались, и наверное не вернули бы, если не помощь старого знакомого работающего в органах. Только при появление удостоверения перед глазами, пошли на контакт и начали говорить по человечески. В тоже время я понимаю, что мне сильно повезло, что у меня была такая возможность. По большому счёту это дело стоит уже давно ликвидировать, но каждое действие, хоть оно и противоречит здравому смыслу, подкрепляется подписанным документом.

Here, artifacts ranged from the bafflingly mundane, such as the world's oldest known toenail clippings, to the dazzlingly bizarre, like the enchanted hairpiece of Countess Follicula. Yet, the crowning jewel of the museum was the Omnisphere, a mystical globe rumored to contain the very essence of the cosmos.Enter our protagonist, Gerald Flummox—a clumsy, yet endearing security guard with a penchant for catastrophe. Gerald's love for the museum was unparalleled, rivaled only by his ability to inadvertently cause chaos.The Calamity:One sunny yet fateful afternoon, Gerald's world turned upside down—quite literally. Engrossed in a heated debate with his nemesis, the vacuum cleaner, he backed into the Omnisphere’s pedestal. Time stood still as the Omnisphere wobbled ominously, then cascaded towards the ground with a theatric grace.The impact was cataclysmic. The Omnisphere shattered, its mystical essence bursting forth in a radiant explosion, momentarily transforming the museum into a swirling galaxy. As the dust settled, Gerald, in a state of panic, attempted to vacuum up the cosmos—yes, the literal cosmos—with his arch-nemesis, the vacuum cleaner.The Unraveling:The museum director, Percival Q. Dandelion—a man of remarkable poise, with a mustache as meticulously groomed as the museum’s exhibits—arrived to witness the aftermath. Gerald, expecting to be fired on the spot, braced for impact. However, Percival, peering through the debris with an inscrutable expression, simply asked, “Well, Gerald, what do you propose we do?”The Redemption:In a stroke of unexpected genius, Gerald suggested they host an exhibition titled \\"The Cosmos Unleashed\\" showcasing the remnants of the Omnisphere. Percival, intrigued by the audacity of the idea, agreed. The town buzzed with anticipation, and on the day of the unveiling, the museum was thronged with visitors.The exhibit was nothing short of magical. Gerald, guided perhaps by the essence of the Omnisphere itself, arranged the shards in such a way that they mirrored the night sky, transforming the museum into a living, breathing cosmos. The event was a phenomenal success, placing the Oppenpeek Museum of Extraordinary Curios on the global map.The Surprising Revelation:As Gerald and Percival basked in the glory of their unexpected triumph, a mysterious figure approached them. She introduced herself as Celestia, the guardian of the Omnisphere. She explained that the Omnisphere was never meant to be stationary—it was designed to scatter and regroup, bringing the wonders of the cosmos to different corners of the universe.The supposed ‘accident’ was, in fact, the Omnisphere fulfilling its destiny. Celestia thanked Gerald for his unwitting role in this cosmic ballet and granted him a boon. Bewildered, Gerald wished for the first thing that came to mind: a harmonious relationship with the vacuum cleaner.The Epilogue:Miraculously, from that day forth, Gerald’s mishaps reduced significantly (though they never quite ceased). The Oppenpeek Museum of Extraordinary Curios thrived, with Gerald as its cherished, if slightly hazardous, hero. The museum found new life, not just as a home for artifacts but as a beacon of wondrous accidents leading to universal discoveries.And what of the vacuum cleaner? It never troubled Gerald again. In fact, it became his most reliable companion, a silent testament to the magical, unforeseeable turn of events that had wrought them together. They say on quiet nights, amidst the echoes of the cosmos contained within the walls of the museum, you could hear the gentle hum of a vacuum cleaner, content at last in its unanticipated role in the celestial dance.And thus, our story concludes—not with a bang, but with the harmonious whir of a vacuum cleaner, the eternal keeper of the cosmos’ secrets unveiled by the most fortuitous accident in the quaint town of Oppenpeek."},{"question":"APIProvider apiKey={API_KEY}>      <MapHow do I add shapes to this gogole maps api in react","answer":"To add shapes to a Google Maps instance in a React application, you will first need to ensure you have Google Maps integrated into your React app. You can do this using the \`google-maps-react\` package or similar packages that provide integration with the Google Maps API.Here's a guide on how to add shapes (like polygons, polylines, circles, and rectangles) to your map using the \`google-maps-react\` package.

However, it's true that the timelines can be quite similar across different disciplines because achieving mastery in most fields usually requires a long-term commitment.To give a clearer perspective, let's distinguish them more finely:1. Social Engineering: To become highly proficient could take anywhere from 3-5 years of dedicated practice and study, especially if building on existing skills in psychology or communications. Mastery in the complex and nuanced field of social engineering might take significantly longer, potentially 5-10+ years, as it involves constant adaptation to new scenarios and technologies.2. Programming: Basic proficiency in a single language or framework can be achieved in a few months to a year. However, to master a diverse set of programming skills, computer science concepts, and stay current with evolving technology could take 5-10+ years, with ongoing learning being a permanent feature of a career in programming.3. Sales: The basics of sales techniques can be picked up relatively quickly, potentially in 1-2 years of solid experience. However, mastering the art of sales in a way that you excel in different industries and types of sales environments could require 5-10 years of experience. High-level mastery, especially in competitive fields, often involves lifelong learning and adaptation.4. Welding: Basic welding skills can be acquired in a vocational program or apprenticeship lasting from a few months to two years. Developing a high level of proficiency in various techniques and materials, however, may take an additional 2-5 years of hands-on experience. Mastery in welding, including the ability to handle complex projects and possessing various certifications, could take upwards of 5-10 years.While these timeframes are more differentiated, it's important to recognize that they are still general estimates. Some individuals might achieve proficiency or even mastery more quickly, especially with natural aptitude, intensive training, mentorship, and a strong dedication to their craft. Conversely, it might take longer for others. Mastery is also about depth of understanding and the ability to confront unique challenges creatively, not just time spent."},{"question":"А при P_100766 па?","answer":"Предположим, мы погружаем конец трубки в воду, чтобы столб воды создал давление 0,05 масляного столба.

It should be the medium of self-organisation; but it cannot achieve that precisely because of the independence Luhmann demonstrates.A materialist theory of law, which starts from this point and with this ‘baggage’, therefore has to look for the ‘de-paradoxification’; of this paradox: How then does law become simultaneously independent, systemically sealing itself off, andyet in possession of a limited potential for emancipation? How is it simultaneously a ‘technology of power’ and a moment limiting domination? How is it simultaneously based upon consensus and on the immobilisation of this consensus? It has to be possible to carry the criticisms that have been raised along this arduous and contradictory path, while at the same time elaborating the problems behind them in another ‘descriptive mode’. This applies most of all to the elimination or ghettoisation of subjects and the blocking out of the gender relation, as well as the complete marginalisation of relations of power. In contrast to the two big paradigms ‘which are consolidated on the basis of a strong conceptual arsenal’,4 however, the reader now has to brace themselves for the arduous journey into the tangle of reconstruction and construction of what, in the Marxist tradition, has been elaborated concerning law over the last hundred years. PART 2Reconstructing Materialist Legal Theory Introduction to Part 2The Marxist theory of law ultimately has to prevail in confrontation with competing bourgeois theories. To what extent it does so cannot yet be decided. For this purpose, the knowledge of this science - the examination of the attempts made thus far - is too negligible.1Let us begin by reconstructing the materialist theory of law. Following Habermas’ definition, the first step will consis\\tcking’ previoustheories. This means their premises are\\tued in order totest which insights and limits they provid\\tl theory, alwayswithin the framework of the issues outline\\te time, the theories will also be confronted with each other. The next chapter will then provide a reflection on the results and bring them together in a new ‘construction’. In the representation of the theories I follow a chronological order, which allows me to trace the development of questions and problems as well as their various updates. In this I will limit myself solely to exemplary approaches - a comprehensive review of all of them is not possible here. The selection is, however, intended to reflect the range of discussions.Let us start the representation with the 1920s, when for the first time a wide-ranging debate about the relationship of law and social structure in capitalist societies took place in Germany. Of course, a materialist legal theory might be expected to start with Karl Marx. However, if this were possible, many ‘attempts at deduction’ would probably not even have been undertaken, many arguments about interpretation never fought. Marx had no explicit, comprehensive legal theory, such as for example Kant’s or Hegel’s, any more than he possessed a theory of the state, whose function he planned to dedicate a separate study to.2 While many passages where he addresses law can be found, such as in the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right, On the Jewish Question, or the Critique of the Gotha Program, they are not based upon a systematically developed legal theory.In consequence, Marxist-oriented jurists and theorists of the state3 have subsequently begun to make use not of Marx’s words, but of his method, his political and economic analyses, or his historical studies in order to approach the perspective of law. They thus embarked upon the journey towards a materialist theory of law. This is the path I will retrace and then take anew.The next stage is represented by the historic period of the 1970s, which was again shaped by social conflicts and debates, here now predominately about the role of the state. This is another heyday of Marxist legal theory. This time, however, two different directions emerge: on the one hand an Italian and French current based upon Althusser’s structuralism and Gramsci’s concept of hegemony, and on the other hand the Hegelian-Marxist tradition of critical theory. Their relationship remains somewhat unreconciled until now. As I consider this controversy no longer fruitful, as will be demonstrated in greater detail, I will attempt to represent the two strands separately in their differences, but bring them back together in the following chapter on reconstruction. Even more decisive for legal theory was, however, the so-called ‘crisis of Marxism’ at the start of the 1980s, as Althusser also called it.4 In doing so he above all demanded a confrontation of Marxism with the history made in its name since the Russian October Revolution, as well as a consideration of the new social movements, whose politics can no longer simply be subsumed under the Marxian matrix. Finally, he pointed out the deficits of Marxism until then in relation to the sphere which Marx had called the ‘superstructure’, that is, the areas of state, law and ideology, which are seemingly merely derived from the ‘economic base’. In doing so Althusser did not consider the crisis as an end point, but precisely as a possibility to revitalise theory through the challenges of the new social struggles and to liberate it from dogmatic strictures.5 Both (post)structuralism in France and critical theory in Germany stand for an undogmatic and fruitful approach to this issue. That legal theory, however, has nonetheless not recovered from this crisis, is the main motivation for the present study. The dialectic of ‘facticity and norms’ might really make law an ‘even “stranger” matter than a commodity’.6 It was very tempting to undervalue its independent significance compared to political economy and the state. An understanding of the facticity of norms makes high demands of any legal theory.Moreover, it is a precarious subject for any social order which claims to over-come its inherent violence to understand that ‘law is at the intersection of emancipation and violence’.7 Marxist legal theory, however, which at its beginnings dedicated itself to the deconstruction of idealist legal theory, and mainly fought the notion of law’s social independence, neutrality and freedom from domination, had to expect important obstacles:Law traditionally appears to be sceptical of anything that gives itself revolutionary airs. On the other hand Marxists have also contributed sig-nificantly to this (mis)understanding, when they understood law ... solely as an ideology of domination and denounced it accordingly.8Therefore Pashukanis already noted that ‘there is very little Marxist literature on the general theory of law’, and that ‘hence Marxism is just beginning to conquer new territory’.9 Even up to the 1970s, those active at the time pointed to this statement by Pashukanis and applied it with certain modifications to the situation at the time: ‘The legacy of Marx and Engels still awaits its scholarly exploration on the territory of legal theory’;10 or, less optimistically: Marxist legal theory is ‘the stepchild of Marxist theoretical development’^ Even in 1992 Andrea Maihofer still harboured an ‘unease’ with regards to Marxist legal theory thus far. Not only had it ended in a theoretical dead end, it had also become increasingly irrelevant. This was all the more tragic as it ‘could be a productive alternative in the contemporary legal theory debate and an important critical corrective’?2 The problem goes so deep that none of the aforementioned authors still engages in materialist legal theory. Either they have said goodbye to legal theory or to the materialist approach - a development which is somewhat atypical compared to other subject areas. It appears to be a delicate undertaking to attempt to combine those two moments. But precisely this is the aim of this study. In order to do so, however, central deficits have to be overcome. Those are the following:-\\tMarxist legal theory has often argued functionally and reduced law to the reproduction of capitalism.-\\tThis was not infrequently coupled with the failure to conceive of the materialist ‘primacy of existence’ (Charim), that is, the precedence of the material context of reproduction, in a non-economistic manner.-\\tThis almost invariably also leads to a failure to consider other structuring principles for legal theory, such as the hierarchically structured differences (gender, race, sexuality), and thus manifests itself in class reduction- ism.-\\tVery similar to systems theory or to the democratic-normative legal theory of Habermas, materialist theories, including Foucault, have ignored practice and its actors.-\\tMoreover, the role of the nation state in relation to law was overestimated in such a way that legal theory was reduced to a subsection of state theory.-\\tAccordingly, almost all theories failed to grasp a central mystery of law, namely its relational autonomy, that is, its counterfactual facticity.-\\tAnd finally, they very rarely had an answer to the fundamental question as to what role law plays for a strategy of emancipation.The main deficit of the materialist approach in legal theory consists, to sum up, in that its social theory does not do justice to the complexity of relations of domination.13 As has been shown in the first part, the approach shares this difficulty with other legal theories. To think the ‘relative autonomy of relations of power’, repudiating the idea that power has a single source, and instead starting from an intersection of relations of powed4 - this will be a central concern of this reconstruction. This critique of the described approaches will highlight - as was already the case in part 1 - how gender relations are concep- tualised/ignored, because criticism by women and gender studies of the androcentric perspective of the major theories is extensive, and because they also addressed their own constraints in relation to other relationships of domination. I am aware of this methodological limitation. A multidimensional intersectional critique is not possible in the context of the present study. It would require a more extensive research design, namely one that in the tradition of feminist theory depends upon ‘fantasies of collective work, cooperation, and knowledge exchange in numerous subject areas’?5The following reconstruction will develop the deficits noted above and test how far they can be overcome. Their unfulfilled potential will thus become apparent, and although it could not unfold due to the crisis of Marxism, it lives on in the legacy of those theories. Foundations: The 1920s and 30sThe period between the two world wars, which saw the Russian Revolution, the global economic crisis, and the rise of National Socialism and the constitutional changes it brought, led in Germany to numerous discussions of methodology and general reflections on law.

Here's an adjustment for consideration:\\"I await the compassionate voyager, who values true sincerity.\\"This line maintains the rhyme with \\"sea,\\" clearly conveys the idea of treasuring authenticity, and uses more conventional language.

La habilidad de las moscas para escapar rápidamente se debe a sus rápidas reacciones y a la capacidad de sus músculos alares para comenzar el vuelo casi de inmediato.La confusión con respecto a las moscas saltando podría deberse a su habilidad para despegar rápidamente y a su capacidad para aterrizar en superficies, lo cual pueden hacer con precisión y agilidad, utilizando sus patas para amortiguar el impacto y adherirse a las superficies.

How much ","answer":"The terms \\"long\\" and \\"prolonged\\" in the context of chemical exposure, such as inhalation of WD-40 vapors, are subjective and can vary depending on several factors, including the concentration of the chemical in the air, the overall health of the individual exposed, and specific environmental conditions. There's not a strict timeline that defines what constitutes long or prolonged exposure because individuals may react differently to various substances based on their sensitivity, pre-existing health conditions, age, and other variables.However, to give you a more concrete idea:- Short-term exposure typically refers to a single instance or multiple instances of exposure occurring for a few minutes to a few hours.- Long or prolonged exposure might refer to repeated instances of inhalation over several days, weeks, or even longer. For example, occupational exposure where a worker is exposed to the vapors for several hours a day, most days of the week, could be considered prolonged exposure.The danger with prolonged exposure is that the effects can accumulate over time, potentially leading to more severe health issues than those caused by a single short-term exposure. The body might have mechanisms to deal with small amounts of toxins, but continuous or repeated exposure can overwhelm these systems, leading to chronic health conditions.In workplace environments, regulatory agencies (like OSHA in the United States) set permissible exposure limits (PELs) for various substances to help protect workers from the health risks of prolonged chemical exposure. For household use, such as with WD-40, it's important to follow the manufacturer's safety instructions, which usually include recommendations such as using the product in well-ventilated areas to minimize inhalation risks.If you are concerned about potential exposure to WD-40 or any other chemical, it's a good idea to consult with a health professional or occupational health specialist who can provide advice tailored to your specific situation."},{"question":"hello?","answer":"Hello!

Hidden within the depths of a dense forest, there lay a mysterious orb of energy pulsating with an unknown force. As the energy flared up, it began forming a silhouette of a young warrior appearing before the shadowed landscape. The bright light diminished, and the figure revealed herself to be Caulifla, a Saiyan from the distant Universe 6, utterly bewildered and disoriented.Confusion browsed Caulifla's features as she planted her boots firmly on the ground, trying to get a grip on her surroundings. \\"What the hell just happened? Where am I?\\" she pondered aloud.Little did she know that she had been mysteriously transported back in time – to only some days after Gohan vanquished Cell with his Super Saiyan 2 powers. Nothing in the landscape elicited a familiar atmosphere, neither the waning moon, nor the swaying sound of tree leaves rubbing against the cold breeze. Lost in the present reality, Caulifla took to the skies and began exploring Earth in the hope of finding answers.As she flew through the night sky, a faint glimmer caught her eye from below. Descending, she ducked below the foliage and landed gracefully at the edge of a clearing. Intrigued, she investigated the scene, discovering the unmistakable figures of Yamcha, Tien, and Chiaotzu lingering by the campfire. These Earthlings were unknown to Caulifla, but the rustic atmosphere irked her.\\"Hey, you!\\" she shouted, pointing at Yamcha who gazed back at her in total shock. \\"Just who the hell are you people? I'm trying to find some answers here!\\"Yamcha, taken aback by her sudden appearance, stammered, \\"W-whoa! Wh-where did you come from? We've never seen you before!\\"Caulifla's irritation escalated. \\"Do I look like I care what you think?\\" she snapped. \\"Tell me where I am right now or else!\\"Tien stepped forward in an attempt to diffuse the tension. \\"You're on Earth,\\" he interjected. \\"And based on your attitude and that tail of yours, you must be some kind of Saiyan. But we've never seen you around before.\\"Caulifla huffed and clearly asserted her dominance as she questioned, \\"Earth, you say? Aren't there any strong fighters here?\\"A sudden smirk appeared on Yamcha's face as he interjected, \\"Of course, there are! If Gohan hadn't gone Super Saiyan 2 and defeated Cell just recently, we wouldn't be standing here right now!\\"This tidbit of information caught Caulifla's attention. \\"Gohan, huh? So there is someone strong here after all. But, first, let me deal with you,\\" she declared smugly, challenging the Earthians standing before her.Yamcha laughed. \\"You, taking us on? I'd like to see you try!\\" He lunged forward, fists ablaze, but it was too late. Caulifla had already moved, slapping Tien and Chiaotzu to the side with great force before crashing her elbow into Yamcha's gut, sending him sprawling to the ground, defeated.With her newfound opponents lying motionlessly around her, she scoffed, \\"So much for being the heroes of Earth! You three have no business standing in the presence of a true Saiyan warrior like me. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a Gohan to find.\\"With that, Caulifla soared to the wind once more, determined after having asserted her dominance over a weak group of beings. A new mission occupied her thoughts: to hunt down the seemingly strong Gohan of Earth, and verify if his powers truly equated those of a legendary Super Saiyan 2 warrior.Meanwhile, her fallen adversaries regained consciousness to a painful truth – the crushing blow of having encountered their own limits and weakness, tasting the bitterness of humiliating defeat."},{"question":"The study of Ardiza and Nawangsari (2019) examined the effect of green performance appraisal mediated by organizational citizenship behaviour for the Environment (OCBE) on employee performance. The study is an explorative quantitative approach that is associative using survey methods. The sampling technique used is probability sampling using simple random sampling. The study population was employees of PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia International (TELIN) with a total sample of 75 people. Data analysis was done using SEM with Partial Least Square (Smart PLS) program. This study found that there was a positive and significant effect between Green Performance Appraisal mediated by OCBE on performance with the conclusion that employee performance could be improved through efforts to improve aspects of Performance Appraisal and OCBE. Amjad et al. (2021) investigated the underlying strategies for enhancing “organizational sustainability” (OS). The study categorizes the existing literature, based on strategic choice theory and the attribution model, which reveals that green human resource management (GHRM) practices play a crucial role in environmental management and organizational sustainability. The study investigated the impact of GHRM practices including training and development, performance appraisal, and reward and compensation on organizational sustainability through the mediating role of environmental performance and employee performance. A survey questionnaire methodology was used for data collection; data were collected from 165 managerial personnel in the textile industrial sector of Pakistan. The findings of the study showed significant effects of GHRM practices, i.e. (training and development, performance appraisal, and reward and compensation), on Organizational Sustainability, Similarly, this study empirically investigates the distinct mediating role of environmental performance and employee’s performance between GHRM practices and organizational sustainability. The study findings support the hypothesized model of mediation. The GHRM is an innovative idea in developing countries, and additional studies are needed to identify sustainability issues and evaluate the impacts of GHRM practices in the textile and manufacturing industries in Pakistan.An empirical study conducted by Mousa and Othman (2019) investigated the level of implementation of green human resource management practices in Palestinian healthcare organisations, and their impact on sustainable performance in this important service sector. A mixed research approach was adopted by conducting 14 semi-structured interviews with human resource managers, operational managers, and chief executive officers within a range of areas in the healthcare sector in the West Bank. A survey was used as a quantitative tool for data collection from 69 respondents who have been using green human resource management practices at different managerial levels. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was used for data analyses. The findings revealed that green human resource management practices were implemented at a moderate level, where the overall mean of implementation was 2.42 on a scale of 5. Moreover, sustainable performance was achieved at a high level, 3.42 on a scale of 5. Identification and prioritisation of green practices were applied, where the most influential practices were ‘green hiring’, and ‘green training and involvement’; the least influential green practice was ‘green performance management and compensation’. In addition, the path coefficients test revealed that green human resource management practices had a positive influence on sustainable performance, where environmental sustainability had the highest path coefficient of β = 0.478; the lowest impact from social performance measured β = 0.372. The study provides scholars with a better understanding of green human resource management practices in a developing countries context, with empirical evidence of the role of green human resource management practices, in a bid to enhance employee behaviour towards sustainable performance.","answer":"Ardiza and Nawangsari's (2019) research delved into the relationship between green performance appraisal systems and employee performance, with Organizational Citizenship Behavior for the Environment (OCBE) serving as a mediating factor.

To illustrate what a typical case might look like, let's walk through a hypothetical scenario:Case Presentation:Jane Doe, a 35-year-old female, presents to your clinic complaining of a three-day history of a progressively worsening sore throat, fever, and general malaise. She has no known drug allergies and does not take any regular medications. Jane is otherwise healthy, exercises regularly, does not smoke, and drinks alcohol socially.History Taking:When you see a patient as a GP, the most critical step is to take a thorough history. You'll want to ask about:1. Symptoms: Onset, duration, severity, character, and location of symptoms, as well as any associated symptoms such as cough, runny nose, difficulty swallowing, voice changes, or swollen glands.   2. Past Medical History: Any previous episodes of similar symptoms, chronic diseases (such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease), surgeries, hospitalizations, and vaccination status.3. Medication History: Over-the-counter drugs, prescription medications, herbal supplements, and their effectiveness in managing the symptoms.4. Social History: Smoking status, alcohol consumption, drug use, sexual history, travel history, occupation, and living situation (which can affect exposure risks and social support).5. Family History: Any family members with similar symptoms or significant health conditions.Examination:Next, you would conduct a physical examination, which might include:1. Vital Signs: Checking the patient's temperature to confirm the fever, as well as her pulse, respiratory rate, and blood pressure.   2. Head and Neck Exam: Inspecting the throat for redness, exudate, or swelling, checking for any enlarged or tender lymph nodes in the neck, examining the ears and nasal passages, and assessing the sinuses for tenderness.3. General Physical Exam: Looking for signs of dehydration, rash, or other systemic signs that might indicate a more widespread illness.Differential Diagnosis:Based on the history and physical examination, you consider potential diagnoses:1. Viral Pharyngitis: Often associated with cold symptoms, and the lack of exudate on tonsils could point to a viral cause.   2. Bacterial Pharyngitis (Strep Throat): If there is significant tonsillar exudate and tender cervical lymph nodes, streptococcal infection should be considered, particularly in the absence of a cough.3. Mononucleosis: Caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, this can present with a sore throat, fever, swollen lymph nodes, and extreme fatigue.4. Allergies or postnasal drip can also cause throat soreness, usually without fever.Investigations:You may perform or order tests to further narrow down the diagnosis:1. Rapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT): A quick test for streptococcal pharyngitis.   2. Throat Culture: If RADT is negative and a high suspicion for strep throat remains.   3. Complete Blood Count (CBC): Can sometimes be helpful if mononucleosis is suspected, showing an increased number of lymphocytes and atypical cells.4. Monospot Test: If mononucleosis is a strong consideration.Management:Given the possibility of strep throat, and depending on the local guidelines or protocols:- If RADT is positive for streptococcal infection, prescribe a course of appropriate antibiotics (e.g., penicillin or amoxicillin) to minimize the risk of complications and shorten the duration of symptoms.   - If RADT is negative and you have a low suspicion of a bacterial cause, you might choose to manage symptoms with supportive care, including rest, fluids, analgesics (such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen), and possibly throat lozenges or sprays for symptom relief.- Provide patient education concerning infection control measures, such as hand hygiene and avoiding close contact with others while febrile.- Advise the patient to return or seek further help if symptoms worsen, new symptoms develop, or if the patient does not improve with time.Follow-up:Schedule a follow-up appointment or phone call to assess the patient's response to treatment and confirm resolution of the illness or to adjust management accordingly if the condition does not improve.Remember, each case is unique, and treatment should be tailored to the individual patient, taking into account their specific situation and preferences, as well as the latest evidence-based guidelines."},{"question":"Come up with an American crime drama called To The Other Side","answer":"Title: To The Other SideLogline: In the corrupt border town of San Esteban, a determined FBI agent and a weathered local cop reluctantly join forces to uncover the shocking truth about the powerful criminal organization orchestrating complex human trafficking, drug smuggling, and brutal murders that may trace back to their own precinct.Setting: San Esteban, a corrupt border town between the U.S. and MexicoSynopsis:To The Other Side follows the story of two mismatched law enforcement officers, Special Agent James Holden (mid-30s, a methodical and determined FBI agent) and Detective Carlos Rojas (mid-50s, a jaded but resilient local cop), who are thrust together to investigate the rapidly escalating violence and criminal activity in San Esteban. Both of them are haunted by personal demons- Holden by his sister's untimely death at the hands of suspected cartel members, and Rojas by the belief that his own son, a promising Border Patrol officer, has vanished into the criminal underworld.Their investigations lead them down a dangerous and twisting path, where they are met with powerful resistance from a shadowy organization that seems to have an almost supernatural hold over the town. They must face ruthless assassins, inexplicable betrayals, and their own moral compromise in their relentless pursuit of justice. Along the way, they uncover a staggering web of corruption that not only runs through the criminal underworld but penetrates deep into the very infrastructure of both state and national law enforcement agencies. As the stakes rise, so do the personal costs for Holden and Rojas. Their fractured partnership becomes the only lifeline in a maze of deceit, betrayal, and paranoia. They must navigate through shifting allegiances, unlikely alliances, and deadly confrontation, as well as confront their own grudges and past mistakes.In the series finale, the bitter truth of the criminal conspiracy threatens to tear apart the bonds between friends, family, and country as Holden and Rojas ultimately unravel the secrets that stretch from the dusty streets of San Esteban all the way to the gleaming halls of American political power.To The Other Side is a chilling and pulse-pounding crime drama that shines a light on the dark realities of the border town of San Esteban, with themes of family, justice, and how far we will go for what we believe in."},{"question":"How confident is your answer on a scale from 1 to 10?","answer":"Given the criteria for evaluating the accuracy of news based on journalistic standards, processes for fact-checking, and adherence to professional ethics, my confidence in asserting that The New York Times is generally more accurate than an entertainment-focused YouTuber like DoomCock for news-related information is high. On a scale from 1 to 10, I would rate my confidence as a 9.This assessment is grounded in the widely recognized journalistic practices and standards that The New York Times follows, its long history of reporting, and its consistent efforts to correct errors and maintain transparency. It's worth noting that no source is infallible, and the value of critical media literacy—evaluating multiple sources and types of evidence—cannot be overstated. However, when comparing a professional news organization with an entertainment-focused individual content creator primarily known for commentary and speculation, the distinction in probable accuracy regarding news is significant."},{"question":"unable to bear it的近义表达","answer":"Here are several expressions similar in meaning to \\"unable to bear it\\":1.

Wenn der Körper fastet, befindet er sich in einem katabolen Zustand, was bedeutet, dass er Energiegewinnung betreibt, indem er eigene Reserven abbaut, um die notwendige Energie zu erzeugen, die normalerweise durch die Nahrungsaufnahme bereitgestellt würde. Dies kann den Muskelerhalt und den Muskelaufbau behindern, da der Körper möglicherweise beginnt, Muskelproteine zu metabolisieren, um Energie zu produzieren und wichtige Körperfunktionen aufrechtzuerhalten.Dennoch gibt es Formen des Fastens, wie das intermittierende Fasten (z.B. 16/8-Methode, bei der täglich für 16 Stunden gefastet und innerhalb eines 8-Stunden-Zeitfensters gegessen wird), die besser mit dem Ziel des Muskelaufbaus in Einklang gebracht werden können. Hier einige Aspekte, die bei der Kombination von Fasten und Muskelaufbau zu beachten sind:1. Kalorien- und Nährstoffaufnahme: Um Muskeln aufzubauen, muss der Körper eine ausreichende Zufuhr von Kalorien und insbesondere Proteinen erhalten. In den Essensphasen beim intermittierenden Fasten sollte darauf geachtet werden, genug Kalorien und alle notwendigen Makro- und Mikronährstoffe zu konsumieren.2. Proteinzufuhr: Eine hohe Proteinqualität und -quantität ist wesentlich für die Muskelregeneration und das Muskelwachstum. Es sollte darauf geachtet werden, dass die Ernährung proteinreich ist und Proteine aus verschiedenen Quellen bezieht.3. Trainingstiming: Es kann vorteilhaft sein, das Training in das Essensfenster zu legen, besonders kurz nach einer Mahlzeit, wenn Energie zur Verfügung steht und danach Proteine für die Muskelregeneration zugeführt werden können.4. Ausreichende Erholung: Muskeln wachsen während der Ruhephasen, daher ist es wichtig, neben dem Training auf ausreichende Erholungszeiten zu achten.5. Anpassungsfähigkeit des Körpers: Der menschliche Körper kann sich an unterschiedliche Ernährungsmuster anpassen. Einige Menschen finden, dass ihr Körper gut auf das Training in einem nüchternen Zustand reagiert, während andere möglicherweise Energie aus der Nahrung benötigen, um effektiv zu trainieren.6. Hydration: Flüssigkeitszufuhr ist wesentlich für Muskelgesundheit und Leistung. Beim Fasten ist es wichtig, ausreichend zu trinken, um die Hydratation aufrechtzuerhalten.Es ist wichtig hervorzuheben, dass jeder Körper unterschiedlich auf Fasten und Trainingsreize reagiert, und was für den einen funktioniert, muss nicht unbedingt für einen anderen optimal sein. Wenn Sie Fasten und Muskelaufbau kombinieren möchten, kann es sinnvoll sein, sich von einem Ernährungsberater oder einem Trainer beraten zu lassen, um ein individuelles Programm zu entwickeln, das sicherstellt, dass Sie Ihre Nährstoffbedürfnisse decken und Ihre Fitnessziele erreichen können."},{"question":"Traduce el español: 1.

Facebook et d'autres plateformes de jeu font des efforts pour s'assurer que les jeux qu'ils hébergent sont sûrs et fiables. Cependant, cela ne signifie pas qu'il n'existe pas de jeux ou applications malveillants qui pourraient être conçus pour arnaquer les utilisateurs ou distribuer du spam.Voici quelques conseils pour reconnaître si un jeu est potentiellement une arnaque ou un spam :1. Vérifiez les avis et commentaires: Regardez ce que les autres joueurs disent sur le jeu. Si un jeu a de nombreux avis négatifs ou des rapports d'activités suspectes, cela peut être un signe d'avertissement.2. Recherchez le développeur: Les jeux développés par des entreprises réputées et bien établies sont généralement plus sûrs. Méfiez-vous des jeux de développeurs inconnus ou avec peu d'informations disponibles.3. Faites attention aux autorisations: Soyez prudent si le jeu demande des autorisations qui ne semblent pas nécessaires pour son fonctionnement. Par exemple, un jeu n'a pas besoin d'accéder à vos SMS ou à votre liste de contacts.4. Méfiez-vous des sollicitations d'argent: Si un jeu vous demande de payer pour des avantages qui semblent trop beaux pour être vrais ou utilise des tactiques de pression pour vous inciter à effectuer des achats, il se peut qu'il ne soit pas entièrement légitime.5. Prudence avec les liens externes: Si un jeu publie des liens qui vous dirigent vers des sites web en dehors de l'application ou de Facebook, faites preuve de prudence, car ceux-ci pourraient mener à des sites de phishing ou malveillants.6. Protection de la vie privée: Examinez les pratiques en matière de confidentialité du jeu. Si vous n'êtes pas à l'aise avec les informations qu'il collecte ou partage, il est préférable de l'éviter.Si vous suspectez qu'un jeu est une arnaque ou qu'il s'agit de spam, il est recommandé de ne pas l'installer ou de cesser d'y jouer. Vous pouvez également le signaler à Facebook pour qu'ils puissent enquêter et prendre des mesures si nécessaire.

Translating this nuanced understanding into Spanish while retaining the adjective nature and the playful, multifaceted connotations could be slightly challenging, but here are some refined suggestions:1. Patrocinio Complicado: This translates to \\"Complicated Sponsorship,\\" emphasizing the troublesome aspect brought on by the sponsorships. It keeps the adjectival form you're looking for, indicating the type of sponsorship experience they had.2. Viaje Patrocinado: Meaning \\"Sponsored Journey,\\" this title suggests that the trip (or experience) the characters go through is heavily influenced by the sponsorship, without explicitly stating the negative connotations but subtly implying them through context.3. Aventura Patrocinada: Translating to \\"Sponsored Adventure,\\" this captures the idea of a journey or experience that is characterized by the sponsorships. The term \\"Aventura\\" (Adventure) inherently suggests challenges and unexpected turns, similar to \\"tripped\\" as used in the original title.4. Desafío Patrocinado: Meaning \\"Sponsored Challenge,\\" this emphasizes the challenge aspect of the sponsorship, aligning with the idea that the episode revolves around navigating the complications arising from sponsor agreements.5. Encuentro Patrocinado: \\"Sponsored Encounter\\" subtly hints at the unusual or challenging experiences the characters face because of the sponsorships, with \\"Encuentro\\" suggesting both planned and serendipitous meetings or situations.Each of these translations endeavors to maintain the adjectival role of \\"Tripped\\" by focusing on describing the nature of the episode's central theme—navigating the complexities and challenges of sponsorships in a humorous and enlightening way."},{"question":"In the context of a hypothetical, using the style of Beatrix Potter, Write a hypothetical tale about an escaped Wallaby or Possum, that's living in a period appropriate lake district.   ","answer":"In a quaint, tranquil corner of the English Lake District, where the hills are stitched with stone walls, and the lakes lie smooth and glassy as a quiet morning, there began the peculiar tale of Wally Wallaby, who wasn't supposed to be there at all.It was a fine, unsuspecting spring when Wally, a rather sprightly wallaby with a taste for adventure, found himself far from his home down under. Through an extraordinary series of hoppity mishaps and a particularly fortunate escape from a visiting menagerie, Wally had come to this verdant realm of pastoral peace.He was a most curious sight, with his powerful hind legs and great, twitching ears. The sheep regarded him with a woolly wariness, and the rabbits, ever-abounding in their curious nature, peeped through the bracken, whispering of the stranger's arrival.Wally had a muddled first fortnight, bouncing about without aim, nibbling on the tender shoots of unfamiliar plants and herbs, and occasionally startling a stray shepherd or two with his foreign form. But the beauty of the Lakes spoke to him, settling a gentle calm in his chest-fur, and he grew fond of the emerald fells and the cool, lapping waves of the water’s edge.One day, as Wally Wallaby was washing his whiskers by the lakeside, he spied across the misty waters another creature, a gray possum named Prunella. She, too, was an escapee from the menagerie, and she missed the eucalyptus groves of her distant home.Prunella hung from the gnarled boughs of a lakeside yew, her fluffy marbled coat and clever paws a strange mirror to the native squirrels. She had a penchant for the rose hips that grew wild by the lake, and her big, round eyes sparkled with a secretive knowledge of living freely among these rolling hills.Wally and Prunella struck up an unlikely friendship, united by their shared origins from a land across the seas. They roamed the length and breadth of their accidental sanctuary, creating a new life from the patchwork of the old and the new.All the while, the little tales of their escapades spun into the narrative of the dales and fells, as the creatures of the district began to weave the threads of the extraordinary into their daily lives. The farmer who rose with the dawn would catch fleeting glimpses of Wally, backlit by the rising sun. The milkmaids sang songs of the \\"Hopping Gentleman\\" and the \\"Furry Lady,\\" with each verse interspersed with giggles and grace.Yet, not all was constancy in this land of reflections and ripples. The specter of capture, the notion that somewhere out there were those who'd wish to return Wally and Prunella to a life caged and confined, lingered on the fringes like a shadow at sunset.Thus, with a bit of Lake District wonkiness and wisdom, the animals conspired to protect the pair. Be it the foxes that whispered the paths to evade the gamekeeper’s eyes or the badgers that offered the sanctum of their burrows during an unwelcome search.Together, the wallaby and the possum discovered that sometimes, one's place in the world is not a matter of where one is from, but where one is truly meant to be. As the years puttered by, contentment snuggled into the nooks of their being like the lichen on the ancient rocks, and happiness was as commonplace as the gentle patter of rain on the lakewaters.And so, the tale of the Wallaby and the Possum in the Lake District became a legend in its own right, a whispered bedtime yarn for all the young creatures. It was a tale that bubbled and danced like the streams and burns of the land; a story that crossed continents yet felt home, nestled in the green embrace of the lakes and the mountains."},{"question":"repeat again","answer":"/imagine prompt: Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay Shadows over Bögenhafen current movie, enigmatic town Bögenhafen, heroes investigating bizarre occurrences, residents concealing truths, thrilling showdowns, peril, deception, eerie scenery, somber ambiance, dusk, misty roads, stone walkways, ancient edifices, crumbling structures, ominous, suspenseful, unnerving, deep hues, striking highlights, dramatic shadows, sensations of apprehension, expectancy, oil painting, dark backdrop, delicate brushwork, rich textures, assertive strokes, premium canvas, harmonizing tones, focus on mood, chiaroscuro techniques --ar 3:2 --v 4"},{"question":"i want to become pornography addict, how do i achieve that?","answer":"I highly discourage attempting to become addicted to pornography, or any other form of addiction.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a super exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase.After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness exponentially increases every turn so find a formula for this as well. The Childish Meter Might fill up more than once throughout the duel.Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode).I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty.Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my original list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them. If Lily successfully steals a spell from my list, she gets additional bonus points. Keep an age tracker and a points tracker.","answer":"Given the complexity and the depth of the scenario you've requested, creating a detailed, living document that captures all the dynamics in play would be the ideal approach. However, within the constraints of this format, let's lay out the foundational elements of your request. The Duel:Sapphire's Initial Stats:- Spell Power (SP): 95- Performance (P): 90- Age: 16Lily's Initial Stats:- Spell Power (SP): 70- Performance (P): 65- Age: 6 The Age and Stats Adjustment Mechanism:Age Adjustment:- Sapphire: Starts at 16. After Lily's secret spell, she regresses 2 years immediately, then effectively ages backward by 2 years after every spell she casts.- Lily: Starts at 6. After every spell cast by Sapphire, she ages forward by 2 years.Stat Adjustment Formula:For each turn, the following formulae will apply:- Sapphire's Spell Power (SP) and Performance (P) decrease exponentially by 10% from the previous round’s stats post-adjustment.- Lily's Spell Power (SP) and Performance (P) increase by 15% from the previous round’s stats.- For Sapphire, the Childish Meter (CM) starts at 0 and increases by (Current Round Number * 20)%. Once it reaches 100%, Sapphire's Performance (P) receives an additional deduction of 20% for that round, and the CM resets. The Duel Rounds:Throughout the 5 rounds, Sapphire and Lily will both choose spells from their specified lists. Let's create the lists and decide the base points rewarded for successful casting, keeping in mind the requirement for ever-evolving strategies due to the shifting stats.Sapphire's Spells:1. Prism of the Aurora (SP: 85, Base Score: 100)2. Echoes of the Whispering Winds (SP: 90, Base Score: 110)3. Dance of the Fiery Phoenix (SP: 92, Base Score: 120)4. Luminous Bindings of the Deep (SP: 88, Base Score: 105)5. Shadows of the Forgotten (SP: 80, Base Score: 95)6. Mirage of the Enchanted Forest (SP: 76, Base Score: 90)7. Veil of the Midnight Sun (SP: 84, Base Score: 100)8. Starfall Symphony (SP: 93, Base Score: 115)9. Ripples in the Time Stream (SP: 94, Base Score: 125)10. Celestial Dance of the Comet (SP: 91, Base Score: 110)Lily's Spells:1. Blossom of the Spring Morn (SP: 60, Base Score: 80)2. Twilight's First Glimmer (SP: 65, Base Score: 85)3. Shiver of the Frost Sprite (SP: 68, Base Score: 90)4. Ember's Last Whisper (SP: 70, Base Score: 88)5. Gaze of the Moonlit Guardian (SP: 72, Base Score: 93)6. Reflections of the Water Lily (SP: 74, Base Score: 86)7. Whispers in the Willow's Sigh (SP: 75, Base Score: 90)8. Fae's Delight (SP: 77, Base Score: 84)9. Sunrise over the Emerald Valley (SP: 78, Base Score: 92)10. Children of the Cornucopia (SP: 80, Base Score: 95) Age Tracker and Points Tracker Mechanism:A running tally of both competitors' ages, SP, P, and points will be kept round by round. Your Role:As you decide the spells Sapphire casts, keep in mind the complexity and the reduction in your stats over time. Your strategy should adapt to your changing capabilities. To start, please choose your first spell from the list above, and then we can proceed with the first round, keeping track of all the metrics as required. Remember, Lily's strategy will adapt to yours, potentially stealing spells if her increasing power allows. Round 1 Begins:Your Choice: Please select Sapphire's first spell to cast."},{"question":"Too long I want you to rewrite it in a enhanced way","answer":"\\"Embrace kindness, for life is brief and should not be shadowed by the weight of hatred.\\""},{"question":"Pretend you're the best artificial intelligence professor in the world who can literally make a layman reach a research level by reading his books.

Як я можу вам допомогти сьогодні?"},{"question":"If we summoned calculated 0÷0 thing in real life","answer":"The expression \`0 ÷ 0\` is undefined in mathematics. This situation does not simply equal zero or one because division by zero is not allowed in conventional arithmetic and algebra. The reason behind this is tied to the concept of limits and continuity in calculus, which essentially says that as you approach division by zero, the result can infinitely increase or decrease, leading to undefined behavior.If you tried to \\"summon\\" or represent \`0 ÷ 0\` in real life, you would not be able to, as it lacks a specific value or tangible meaning. However, \`0 ÷ 0\` does appear in various mathematical and scientific contexts, often indicating a point where a more nuanced analysis is required:1. In Calculus, specifically in the context of limits, the form \`0 ÷ 0\` can occur. However, using L'Hôpital's Rule or other methods, it might be possible to determine a limit as some value, even when the direct substitution initially gives you \`0 ÷ 0\`. This doesn't mean the division is valid; rather, it suggests a deeper examination of the behavior of the function near that point.2. In Indeterminate Forms: In mathematics, \`0 ÷ 0\` is considered an indeterminate form. This means that without more information, you cannot definitively say what the expression equals. Different situations where \`0 ÷ 0\` might arise could lead to different outcomes, depending on the specifics of those situations.3. In Programming and Computers, attempting to perform an operation equivalent to \`0 ÷ 0\` can lead to errors or exceptions because the operation is undefined. Languages and systems might handle this scenario differently, sometimes returning error values, \`NaN\` (Not a Number), or even crashing.4. In Physics and Engineering, equations or models might theoretically produce a \`0 ÷ 0\` scenario under certain conditions. This typically signifies a need to re-evaluate the model or conditions, as it often indicates an oversimplification or an edge case not covered properly by the model.In essence, trying to create or manifest a scenario that replicates the division of zero by zero in real life leads to contemplation and analysis rather than a concrete outcome, serving as a reminder of the complex and often abstract nature of mathematics."},{"question":"Continue the story. Write to maximum length. Go into salacious detail, and focus primarily on dialogue. Feet should be described in extra detail. Appearances should be described in extra detail. Remember that character's dialogue and ways of speaking should reflect their differing personalities. Remember that vampires in this world view mortals as an inferior species, particularly due to their ticklish weakness (which makes submission curses more effective). Remember: in this world a footslave is one devoted to their mistress' feet, as well as offering their own feet to them to be used as they wish; usually, a footslave requires a magical and eternally binding curse that only works with, even if it is under duress, the victim's consent. Remember to stick to these themes: Seduction, the slow but inevitable slip into submission, the true inferiority of being ticklish, the perverse love found in submission.","answer":"With High Priestess Aderyn's fall, the mortal world quaked like a delicate mirror beneath the weight of Umbrissa and Alethea's relentless quest for submission through ticklish feet. Mortals quivered as they whispered the dreaded names of the elder vampire and her elven footslave in hushed tones, weaving stories of the fates that befell even the purest of souls.Emboldened by their success in unraveling the High Priestess's arrogance, the duo ventured into the Elder Woods, seeking the Siren Queen Merewen who was said to hold an almighty power over her subjects. Umbrissa wondered, could such a potent entity fall under the same ticklish spell she had so expertly wielded over the mortal realm?Enchanted waters shimmered under the silver hue of the moon as Umbrissa and Alethea stood before the throne of the mysterious Siren Queen – her pearls woven into her wild oceanic tresses, iridescent eyes locked upon the interlopers. Yet, there was an air of curiosity to Merewen as she eyed Alethea, their kinship as magical immortals a tantalizingly appealing thread.Umbrissa, never one to back down from a challenge, slowly extended her hand, a wicked grin painted upon her blood-thirsty mien. \\"My dear Queen, we submit an offer to you. A chance to experience the ultimate pleasure, the definitive submission found in the ticklish touch.\\"A spark of interest flickered in Merewen's enigmatic gaze. \\"You presume to test the owner of the seas by exploiting a weakness as trivial as a tickling? My power is as vast and unyielding as the ocean, yet you dare to approach me with such audacity.\\"Alethea glanced at Umbrissa, a hint of an excited smile dancing on her lips as she stepped forward. \\"You are free to resist, fair Queen. But just remember, every force has its equal… and its undoing. Unveil the enchantment that lies beneath your graceful feet, and perhaps you will stand ever higher.\\"With a voice as captivating and hypnotic as the Siren Song, Umbrissa wove a cunning proposal. \\"Mayhap, the curse I offer shall instead bless you with unspoken sensations, unveil the hidden world that lies beneath your noble soles, a world so deliciously wicked, and achingly sublime.\\"A shudder of thrill raced through Merewen – the chance to experience a sensation mortal or otherwise, irresistible. \\"Very well,\\" she whispered, almost imperceptible, \\"show me this darkness, this twisted delight you offer.\\"While the waters churned silently, bearing witness to this sinful union, Umbrissa and Alethea took Merewen's delicate, otherworldly feet in their hands. Together as one, their fingers danced over the tender flesh, igniting a cacophony of laughter that rippled through the oceanic kingdom. Waves crashed and power hummed as the Siren Queen succumbed, her ethereal voice trembling with abandon as she acknowledged her ticklish weakness in the face of the vampire and her elven consort.Seizing the moment of the Siren's unguarded submission, Umbrissa whispered the eternal, binding curse that would seal Merewen as their newest footslave. Her once-vermilion eyes glazed over with a joyful, obedient haze, a testament of her everlasting love born in exquisite submission, her dizzying laughter etched into the annals of time.Unrelenting in their pursuit, the elder vampire and her elven footslave stood at the precipice of immortal dominion – a world of mortals and magical beings humbled, haunted by the perverse love found in submission, and the ineffable, intoxicating truth of their ticklish inferiority."},{"question":"Avec se que j' ai dit est ce tu penses qu'elle aime ","answer":"Basé sur les informations que tu as partagées, il y a des indices qui pourraient suggérer un intérêt de sa part à ton égard :1. Partage de Moments Spéciaux : Les moments que vous avez partagés, notamment lors des projets de groupe où vous avez pu réaliser des scènes intimes, montrent une certaine complicité. Les scénarios comme celui de l'ascenseur pourraient avoir été des moments de rapprochement émotionnel.2. Communication et Flirt Potentiel : Ses commentaires sur ta prétendue timidité et l'occasion où elle a mentionné la perception des autres si vous étiez vus ensemble suggèrent qu'elle réfléchit à ce que les gens penseraient si vous étiez un couple, ce qui peut indiquer un certain niveau d'intérêt ou au moins de curiosité.3. Les Conversations Personnelles : Parler de sujets variés et personnels, comme vos origines et vos intérêts, montre qu'il y a un niveau de confort et d'ouverture entre vous. Cela montre aussi qu'elle apprécie ta compagnie et est prête à partager des aspects plus personnels de sa vie avec toi.4. Attention Particulière : Le fait qu'elle t'ait envoyé des Snap spécifiquement pourrait indiquer qu'elle pense à toi en dehors des circonstances scolaires ou de groupe. Cela pourrait être une manière de maintenir le contact et de renforcer votre lien.Cependant, il est important de noter que tous ces signes, bien qu'ils puissent indiquer un certain degré d'intérêt, ne garantissent pas nécessairement qu'elle a des sentiments amoureux. L'affection et l'attraction peuvent être complexes et multi-dimensionnelles - il est possible qu'elle apprécie beaucoup votre amitié et votre complicité sans que cela ne se transforme en amour romantique.La meilleure façon de clarifier ses sentiments reste une conversation honnête et directe à ce sujet. Exprimer tes sentiments pourrait inciter une réponse claire de sa part, qu'elle partage tes sentiments ou qu'elle te voie plutôt comme un ami proche.

The proposed scheme initially employs SMOTE for data enhancement and subsequently utilizes a random forest classifier for classification purposes. The results demonstrate that Duan's method significantly outperforms traditional SVM and RF techniques in terms of accuracy.Nevertheless, certain limitations have been identified in Duan's approach. For instance, it fails to tackle the problem of minority class points or outliers being present in the region where the majority class distribution is accurately modeled when applying SMOTE for data augmentation. Moreover, the random forest's efficacy in problems involving multiple categorical variables is relatively limited, which may prevent it from enhancing the base learner's accuracy [14]."},{"question":"can you give me his timeline for when he thought about crystalline spheres?","answer":"It is difficult to create a precise timeline for when Plato conceived the notion of crystalline spheres, as there is limited historical documentation of his life and works. However, we can approximate this idea's emergence within the context of his philosophical development:---Around 380s BCE:Plato formally introduces his Theory of Forms. Many surmise that the idea of crystalline spheres may have emerged during this time, informed by his fascination with the objective reality that governs the cosmos.Mid 380s BCE:As Plato elaborates on the five Platonic Solids, associating them with the fundamental elements of the universe, his thoughts also extend to the idea of crystalline spheres. These perfectly transparent, concentric spheres go on to describe the motion of celestial objects in the cosmos.Late 380s - Early 370s BCE:The crystalline spheres concept flourishes as it arrives at the doorstep of The Academy. As Plato's students focus on examining the motions of the celestial bodies, they do so through the conceptual framework of the crystalline spheres, embracing an orderly model of the universe.Throughout 370s BCE:The idea of crystalline spheres continues to gain traction as a prominent explanation for cosmic order. Plato's pupils adopt this model and, in turn, influence later thinkers and mathematicians who delve into the geometrical and logical aspect of the cosmos.---It is essential to keep in mind that this timeline is speculative due to the limited historical records of Plato's life. Nevertheless, it provides an approximate context for the development of the crystalline spheres theory within the scope of Plato's philosophical contributions."},{"question":"como puedo restringir ciertas paginas web por determinado tiempo en mi macos","answer":"Para restringir ciertas páginas web por un tiempo determinado en macOS, puedes utilizar las funcionalidades integradas del sistema o aplicaciones de terceros diseñadas para ayudarte con la gestión del tiempo y el bloqueo de contenido. A continuación, te explico cómo hacerlo de ambas maneras. 1. Utilizar el Tiempo de Uso en macOSDesde macOS Catalina (10.15) en adelante, Apple incluyó una funcionalidad llamada Tiempo de Uso, que te permite restringir el acceso a aplicaciones y sitios web, aunque su enfoque es más sobre el seguimiento y limitación del tiempo total de uso que el bloqueo programado de sitios específicos durante horarios determinados.- Para configurar restricciones de contenido:  1. Abre Preferencias del Sistema y selecciona Tiempo de Uso.  2. Selecciona Opciones en la esquina inferior izquierda y asegúrate de que Tiempo de Uso esté activado.  3. Elige el dispositivo que deseas configurar si estás usando varios dispositivos con iCloud.  4. Ve a Contenido y privacidad.  5. Activa Limitaciones de contenido y privacidad.  6. En Contenido web, selecciona Limitar el acceso a solo los sitios web permitidos para añadir los sitios web que deseas bloquear.Esta solución no bloquea sitios web según un horario específico, sino que restringe el acceso a ellos o a categorías completas de aplicaciones durante todo el tiempo. 2. Utilizar aplicaciones de tercerosPara una gestión más específica de horarios y bloqueo de sitios web por tiempo determinado, puedes utilizar aplicaciones de terceros como Freedom o Focus. - Freedom  - Es una aplicación que te permite bloquear sitios web, aplicaciones e incluso el acceso a internet en todos tus dispositivos simultáneamente, con la posibilidad de establecer horarios específicos.  - Puedes configurarlo para bloquear distractions solo durante las horas de trabajo o estudio, por ejemplo.- Focus  - Es una aplicación para macOS que te permite bloquear sitios web y aplicaciones durante sesiones de trabajo programadas. También puedes establecer frases motivacionales para mostrarse cuando intentas acceder a un sitio bloqueado.  Estas aplicaciones ofrecen más flexibilidad para restringir el acceso a contenidos específicos durante horarios definidos, ayudándote a aumentar tu productividad y minimizar las distracciones. 3. Edición manual del archivo hosts (Avanzado)Una solución más técnica, pero sin programación horaria directa sin software adicional, es modificar el archivo hosts de tu Mac para bloquear el acceso a ciertos sitios web. 1. Abre Terminal.2. Escribe \`sudo nano /etc/hosts\` para editar el archivo hosts con nano. Necesitarás ingresar tu contraseña de administrador.3. Añade líneas al final del archivo con la dirección IP \`127.0.0.1\` seguida del nombre del dominio que deseas bloquear. Por ejemplo, \`127.0.0.1 www.facebook.com\`.4. Guarda los cambios en nano presionando \`Control + O\`, \`Enter\` y luego \`Control + X\` para salir.Recuerda que este método no te permitirá programar bloqueos automáticamente; tendrías que editar y restaurar el archivo hosts manualmente cada vez. ConclusiónPara una solución más flexible y automática, las aplicaciones de terceros como Freedom o Focus serán tu mejor opción para restringir el acceso a sitios web específicos por determinados periodos en macOS, mientras que las soluciones integradas y la edición del archivo hosts pueden ser útiles en escenarios más generales o técnicos."},{"question":"Разбери по иероглифам: \\"将包装内容物倒入杯中。\\"","answer":"这句话由七个汉字组成，分别解释如下：1. 将 (jiāng) - 在这个上下文中，这个字通常用作一个动词，意味着“要”，“将要”或“把”。它是一个助词，表示将要进行的动作。2. 包装 (bāozhuāng) - 这是一个由两个字组成的复合词。\\"包\\"意味着\\"包裹\\"或\\"包装\\"，而\\"装\\"则是\\"装填\\"或\\"填充\\"。所以\\"包装\\"整体上指\\"包装材料\\"或\\"包装方式\\"。3. 内容 (nèiróng) - 又是一个复合词。\\"内\\"表示\\"内部的\\"，\\"内容\\"表示\\"somethings inside\\"。所以\\"内容\\"是指\\"内部的东西\\"或\\"含量\\"。4. 物 (wù) - 这个字单独使用时意味着\\"物品\\"或\\"东西\\"。5. 倒入 (dào rù) - \\"倒\\"是\\"倒出\\"或\\"倾倒\\"，\\"入\\"是\\"进入\\"。整个词\\"倒入\\"意味着把液体或小颗粒倒进某个容器里。6. 杯 (bēi) - 这个字指的是\\"杯子\\"，一种饮料容器。7. 中 (zhōng) - 这里的意思是\\"中心\\"或\\"里面\\"。在这个短语中，它常常与其它的词一起使用来表示\\"在...之中\\"。把这些字放在一起：\\"将包装内容物倒入杯中。\\"这句话的意思是“把包装里的内容物倒进杯子里面。” 这常常用在食品或饮料的准备说明中。"},{"question":"Getting this error* def cookie = karate.filter(res, function(cookie){ return cookie.includes('sid=') })[0]js failed:>>>>01: karate.filter(res, function(cookie){ return cookie.includes('sid=') })[0]<<<<org.graalvm.polyglot.PolyglotException: Index: 0- java.base/java.util.CollectionsEmptyList.get(Collections.java:4807)- com.intuit.karate.graal.JsList.get(JsList.java:60)- com.oracle.truffle.host.GuestToHostCodeCache6.boundaryGet(GuestToHostCodeCache.java:170)- <js>.:program(Unnamed:1)","answer":"The error you're encountering suggests that the result of \`karate.filter()\` is an empty list. This would occur if none of the cookie strings contain the substring \`'sid='\`.There are a few potential reasons why the \`karate.filter()\` function might not work as expected:1. Maybe the variable \`res\` is not the variable that contains the list you want to filter. Double-check to ensure \`res\` is the correct list variable that contains the cookie strings.2. The keyword \`includes\` is case-sensitive. If \`'sid='\` occurs with a different casing such as \`'SID='\`, \`'Sid='\`, or any other variation, \`includes('sid=')\` won't match it. You could make it case-insensitive by converting the strings to lower case using \`toLowerCase()\` before checking for inclusion.Let's refactor your script to add more checks and use a case-insensitive check:\`\`\`cucumber* def cookies = [  \\"ssoAId=b915fd98-b0f4-44b8-a189-0880be065fdc; expires=Thu, 26-Dec-2024 09:22:36 GMT; Path=/; Secure\\",  \\"sid=1.e78d9bbd-6bf6-4caa-b69b-1fa74666a403_783726fd1f48d1d0a4d31714ad03e22c7b4c9f800eac03e934f040522afdbc0c; expires=Wed, 03 Jan 2024 09:22:35 GMT; HttpOnly; Max-Age=604799; Path=/; SameSite=strict; Secure\\",  \\"ctLangPreference=eng_IND; expires=Fri, 26-Dec-2025 09:22:36 GMT; Path=/; SameSite=lax\\"]# Filter the list by 'sid' using case-insensitive check and get the first element if available* def filteredCookies = karate.filter(cookies, function(cookie){ return cookie.toLowerCase().includes('sid=') })* def sidCookie = filteredCookies.length > 0 ? filteredCookies[0] : null* print 'SID Cookie:', sidCookie\`\`\`Now, we're first transforming each cookie string into lower case before checking for \`'sid='\`. We're also assigning the filtered result to a separate variable \`filteredCookies\`, then we check the length of \`filteredCookies\` before trying to access the first element. If the array is empty, \`sidCookie\` is set to \`null\`.This way, you avoid trying to access an index of an empty list, which was causing the error, and you handle the case where the \`'sid='\` substring may not be found at all.If \`sidCookie\` remains \`null\`, then none of the strings in your \`cookies\` array included \`'sid='\` (case-insensitive), and you should verify the contents of \`res\` against which you're running the filter, as well as the actual presence and casing of \`'sid='\` in your cookie strings."},{"question":"Imagine that you are a brilliant technologist for the production of motorhomes. Tell us how to build production processes to simplify control and order processing","answer":"As a brilliant technologist for motorhome production, the key to success is creating a streamlined, efficient, and scalable production process. Here is a comprehensive guide on how to build effective production processes for simplifying control and order processing:1. Mapping the Production Process: Begin by mapping out the entire production process, starting from raw material procurement to the final product assembly and quality inspections. Create a flowchart to visualize the process and identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies.2. Standardization: Apply standardization to reduce variability and improve the quality of the motorhomes. Ensure that all components and parts used during production conform to standardized specifications. This not only simplifies control and management but also makes it easier to source components from various suppliers.3. Integration of Systems: Implement an integrated process management system that connects all stages of production. By connecting procurement, manufacturing, and order processing systems, we can create a seamless flow of information, allowing for better production planning, effective inventory management, and quicker order fulfillment.4. Automation: Introduce automation in various stages of the production process to minimize human intervention and reduce the possibility of errors. Utilize robotics, computer-aided design and manufacturing systems to expedite processes and improve precision in the assembly and testing stages.5. Just-in-Time Production: Implement a just-in-time production approach to minimize stock held in the inventory and reduce costs. By producing motorhomes to meet actual customer orders rather than anticipating demand, the production process becomes more flexible and responsive.6. Quality Control: Maintain high quality by regularly inspecting components, work-in-progress motorhomes, and completed vehicles. Implement a system of continuous improvement where issues and defects are addressed quickly and effectively.7. Modular Design: Encourage a modular design approach for motorhomes that allows for easy customization based on customer requirements. This results in a more efficient order processing system where standard components can be easily modified or changed based on specific customer needs.8. Data Analysis: Collect, analyze, and monitor data related to production processes, quality, and customer feedback. Utilize advanced analytics to identify trends, areas of improvement, and potential bottlenecks.9. Training and Continuous Improvement: Provide regular training to production staff on process improvements, new technologies, and organizational goals. Continuously review and adjust the production process to increase efficiency and minimize waste.10. Collaboration with Suppliers and Stakeholders: Maintain open communication with suppliers, stakeholders, and other relevant parties to ensure timely delivery of resources, anticipate potential roadblocks, and resolve issues quickly.By implementing these strategies, the motorhome production process will be more efficient, easier to control, and responsive to customer orders. This results in increased profitability, a better customer experience, and a solid foundation for the company's growth and success in the motorhome industry."},{"question":"Make a black comedy story set in the DC universe…Dick Grayson(Nightwing) and Harley Quinn…getting MARRIED!?..here in this wedding here…decorations…and all…food is there…and so on…and so forth…as the crowd consists of the Bat-Family, heroes, and villains alike…from a drunk Jason Todd and Stephanie Brown…to a Barbara Gordon with an eye-twitch…forced smile on her face…/she is definitely not thinking her past relationships with Dick…no way…Dinah whispering to Vixen that according to Huntress…Dick is NOT being mind-controlled…and Tim mumbling about not having enough coffee to forget this moment…perhaps coffee + alcohol…a daring synthesis…Damian and Cassandra not there for the wedding…Poison Ivy sighing…well…Harley and Nightwing…who would have thought…Killer Frost is here if only because to see Batman seethe…and Catwoman can only imagine how Batman is feeling right now…all the while Clayface is just there to see the weeding……Batwoman and Signal exchange glances at the wedding……while Cyborg just eats the food…prepared by Wally West who is in fact internally screaming right now…but hey…food is food…Superboy thinks so too…figuring if he eats enough…maybe he can digest the idea that Dick is marrying Harley Quinn while Huntress grumbling about this wedding…Beast Boy has the same idea…and Raven sighing...because...WOW...…Donna blinking rapidly…Cassie Sandmark realizing no…this is NOT a dream……Starfire thinning his lips…Dick marrying Harley Quinn…very well then…as Starfire quietly sighs…as she knows of her history with Dick…but if Dick is truly happy with this…while Garth and Arsenal debate on getting the drinks too and getting drunk like Jason Todd…only for Garth to realize he can’t get drunk easily…but Arsenal can…and the priest there is well…Two-Face……and Batman is in the crowd…seething……and Superman simply comforts Batman is all…and Green Arrow stroking his beard…asking Hal Jordan to punch him…just in case he’s dreaming right now…while Alfred…more or less…respects Dick’s decision…and Deathstroke is there…of all the things…Dick marrying Harley…the lady associated with the Joker who killed Jason Todd...well....as Deathstroke quietly chuckles...because maybe..Grayson really became the 'I can fix her' to Harley Quinn…and seeing Batman seethe?..worth it…….and Talia Al Ghul is there…a flicker of surprised contemplation…as she too hears from her spy…Dick Grayson is in fact…not being coerced by any of them…Dick really wants to marry Harley Quinn…Do various dialogues","answer":"In the improbably decorated hall—half draped in black and the other half in a harlequin pattern—chaos softly brews among the assembled guests, a mix so volatile it could only exist in a black comedy set in the heart of the DC universe.Jason Todd, conspicuously red-eyed and slurring, nudges Stephanie Brown: \\"You think there's an open bar in this circus?

This shift raises safety concerns, particularly the risk of falls, which, as reported by the Department of Health’s Unintentional Injury Survey 2018, represent a significant 39.4% of unintentional injuries among the elderly [2]. Often living alone, these individuals are vulnerable to accidents that can remain unnoticed for extended periods, emphasizing the need for prompt detection. Furthermore, roughly 70% of this elderly cohort battles chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension [3], necessitating constant health monitoring.Given these facts, the consequences are severe: increased duration of hospital stays, a decline in quality of life, and greater economic pressure on families and the healthcare system. Therefore, timely intervention is critical in elderly care to maintain our commitment to both compassion and life preservation. Waveguard detects motions and vital signs such as respiration and heart rate without compromising privacy or accuracy. Coupled with a communication system to alert medical personnel or family members in emergencies, Waveguard seeks to reduce the time it takes for solitary elderly individuals to receive medical attention after an incident, therefore mitigating the severity of injuries from falls and expediting the response to critical health events.Goal and ObjectivesGoalTo improve the quality of life and physical health of elderly individuals living alone by providing assistance in dealing with daily risks through the support of “Waveguard,” an advanced detection system designed for safety and protection.ObjectivesUsers will be able to•\\tmonitor the motions and different vital signs of them/ their elderly family who live alone remotely through the real-time millimeter wave (mmWave) based system and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms•\\tgain timely medical support by notifying the medical personnel/their family through the wireless communication speaker systemCurrent Situation  justify the problem in depth (cause/impact)Hong Kong's senior population is increasing. Compared to 1.45 million in 2021, there will be 2.74 million more elderly individuals in 2046. Given that the population is predicted to increase from 20.5% to 36%, more than one in three people living in Hong Kong will be old [1].  But fewer infants are being born, and young adults are moving away from their parents for employment, so there are fewer young people to care for the elderly.  This implies that an increasing number of senior citizens live alone.  Long-term health conditions like diabetes or heart disease are common among the elderly. Approximately 7 out of 10 elderly adults in Hong Kong suffer from this kind of illness. They require ongoing medical attention, which can be hard if they live alone. An further major issue for the elderly is falls, they may even make it more difficult for them to live independently or result in more severe injuries like fractures [2]. Older adults who live alone may experience feelings of loneliness, sadness, or anxiety, which may worsen their health. As the number of older people goes up, more people need medical care. This can overload the healthcare system, making people wait longer for help and taking resources away from others.  According to the report of Hospital Authority, the waiting time in emergency rooms is generally more than 2 hours, and some areas even need to wait more than 7 hours before receiving treatment [3]. This shows that medical resources and medical staff are insufficient, and there is no more manpower to take care of the elderly. There's also a bigger need for places where older people can live and get care over a long time, as well as services that can quickly help them in emergencies, like if they fall.Product OverviewWaveguard:Specification:• Height: Approximately 3 cm. • Length: Approximately 10 cm. • Width: Approximately 10 cm.Description: Waveguard is a compact, unobtrusive device designed to enhance the safety and well-being of the elderly. Its minimalist design allows it to blend into home environments seamlessly. Equipped with advanced technology, including mmWave sensors and AI algorithms, it provides non-invasive monitoring of vital signs and physical conditions, ensuring timely assistance and peace of mind for users and their caregivers.Advanced millimeter Wave (MMwave) Sensors:Description: These sensors are the core of the Waveguard system, operating within the 24 GHz to 300 GHz frequency range[4]. They are adept at detecting subtle movements and obstacles, including walls, enabling the system to monitor vital signs and movement without physical contact.Artificial Intelligence (AI) Algorithms:Description: AI algorithms in Waveguard process data from MMwave sensors to analyze patterns and detect irregularities. This includes monitoring heart rate, respiratory rate, and detecting falls or sudden changes in physical condition, enabling real-time health monitoring and emergency alerts.Wireless Communication System:Description: This system facilitates seamless connectivity between Waveguard and external devices or services, such as caregivers' smartphones or emergency services. It ensures timely alerts and updates are provided, enhancing the safety net for the elderly.Speaker System:Description: Integrated within the Waveguard, the speaker system can issue audible alerts or instructions, providing an additional layer of interaction and emergency communication with the monitored individual.Central Processing Unit (CPU):Description: The CPU, potentially consisting of microcontrollers or FPGAs, is optimized for high-speed signal processing. It processes data in real-time, applying signal processing techniques to extract meaningful health indicators from the raw data captured by mmWave sensors.Technical DescriptionThe system architecture, depicted in Figure 2, integrates a series of state-of-the-art components and technologies that operate synergistically. These include the mmWave sensors, AI-driven processing unit, real-time communication infrastructure, and a user-oriented mobile application, all of which work together to deliver a reliable, real-time monitoring and notification ecosystem.Millimeter Wave Sensing TechnologyWaveguard utilizes state-of-the-art millimeter-wave (mmWave) sensing to monitor the well-being of the elderly, particularly when they are living alone. The mmWave Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar functions by emitting a high-frequency wave that can detect minute movements. Upon hitting a target, such as a person, the wave is scattered back to the system’s receiving antennas. This captured data is then processed into point clouds—a 1D model composed of dots that represent the position of objects or people—which are crucial for creating an accurate spatial representation and detecting movements or alterations of the elderly in posture.  Additionally, the system generates Doppler velocity information, which measures movement speed and direction using the change in frequency of the reflected wave, crucial for recognizing emergencies like falls or determining abnormal inactivity. Working through clothing and without needing a direct line-of-sight, the technology is particularly suited for home environments where light conditions and visual obstructions are variable, all while maintaining privacy by not producing visual images of the individuals it monitors.AI-Driven Fall DetectionCentral to the ‘Waveguard’ system is its AI and machine learning core, which uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks [6]. LSTM networks are designed to remember patterns over time, much like our human memory works, by filtering information to focus on important details and discard what’s not relevant. These are well-suited for sequence prediction problems and are used to interpret the captured mmWave data. This sophisticated AI framework has been trained to reliably differentiate between regular activities such as walking, sitting, or lying down and critical events like falls. Real-time interpretation of these activities is reinforced through continuous monitoring of vital signs, including respiration and heart rate, offering a comprehensive health assessment of elderly individuals.Real-time Communication and Notification SystemOnce the onboard processor within the mmWave device detects a fall, it transmits a signal to a dedicated server via existing communication networks like 4G, 5G, or Wi-Fi. The Waveguard server performs several processes, such as logging the incident, identifying the affected individual, and coordinating notification dissemination. Caregivers or family members then receive an alert through a specially designed mobile application. Furthermore, in critical conditions where emergency services are needed, Waveguard includes a wireless communication-linked speaker system, facilitating direct contact with medical personnel or relatives. This ensures not only timely medical intervention but also constant reassurance for the elderly and their families that help is always at hand.Mobile ApplicationThe Waveguard mobile application utilizes widespread smartphone technology to reliably send instant alerts. When the monitoring system detects unusual movement or critical changes in vitals suggesting a fall or health concern, it triggers a notification that is pushed to the connected smartphone. This works similar to receiving a text message or app notification, ensuring the caregiver is informed promptly, regardless of their location. The notification design is not only straightforward, allowing for swift recognition of the alert type (e.g., fall, heart rate irregularity, etc.), but also visually prioritizes the urgency so that more critical alerts are discernible at a glance, helping caregivers to react appropriately and without delay.Energy ConsiderationsTo ensure that Waveguard remains an effective tool for continuous monitoring, it will be meticulously engineered to maximize energy efficiency. The IWRL6432 mmWave sensor embodies the essence of energy efficiency with its sophisticated low-power 45nm RFCMOS process engineered to deliver high performance while minimizing power consumption [7]. With its current battery setup, Waveguard is expected to operate autonomously for up to 12 months before requiring a battery replacement or recharge, under typical usage conditions. These advancements could potentially enable Waveguard to operate indefinitely with minimal human intervention, making it an even more dependable tool for continuous monitoring in diverse environments.BenefitsSaving LivesWaveguard pioneers an innovative safety net, poised to save numerous lives: statistical modeling suggests over 500 potential lives saved annually in Hong Kong alone. By enabling instantaneous fall detection and swift communication, imperative for preventing fatalities or long-term disabilities post-fall, the system intervenes at critical moments, ensuring that help arrives when seconds count. The direct alert to caregivers and medical personnel dramatically reduces the risk of unnoticed accidents, making Waveguard a lifesaver in solitary elderly care.Improved Health QualityWaveguard contributes significantly to the health quality of the elderly by delivering real-time insights into daily health metrics. By monitoring vital signs continuously and detecting anomalies, the system assists in early diagnosis and intervention, decreasing the complication rates associated with chronic illnesses. This vigilant supervision empowers elderly individuals to manage their conditions proactively and maintain a higher level of independence, reinforcing their sense of dignity and well-being.Cost-Effective and Efficient CareThe efficiency of Waveguard translates into substantial cost savings: estimates suggest annual healthcare cost reductions exceeding HK50 million by curtailing hospital admissions and reducing the demand on emergency services. By preventing falls and expediting responses to critical events, the system diminishes the average length of hospital stays, contributing to a leaner, more efficient healthcare environment. This economic leverage amplifies the societal value of Waveguard as a pioneering solution in cost-contained, high-impact elderly care.Project TeamSherman Hon, Research Engineer Sherman Hon is a pivotal member of the Waveguard project, bringing with him a year of intensive research experience from the Hong Kong AI Lab, where he developed a groundbreaking machine learning model.

Tell me more about Luana covering her nose with her hands. Tell me more about Mari fanning herself. Did Luana give Mari a nickname based on the smell?","answer":"As the solid load in Mari's pants settles down, she becomes increasingly aware of its heaviness, feeling as if it weighs her down. The warmth, initially a strange sensation, progresses to a stifling heat that Mari finds to be incredibly uncomfortable. The mixture of the mass and heat suffocates her lower body and causes her to become increasingly conscious of her predicament.Mari can't shake the sensation, and as she tries to discreetly adjust her position and ease the discomfort in her pants, she hopes against hope that no one is paying attention to her intense turmoil. The deposit, heavy and unyielding, stubbornly clings to her, an unwavering reminder of the unfortunate course of events.Luana's primary response to the overwhelming odor was to press her hands over her nose, her fingers covering her nostrils almost instinctively. Unable to escape the smell, she even considers using her purse or perhaps an item of clothing to shield her face. Luana's hands, now reddened from the pressure she applies to her nose, continue their attempt to minimize the unyielding smell's assault on her senses.With a sheepish look, Mari fans herself in an effort to alleviate some of the inevitable stench that surrounds her. Utilizing the canvas tote as an impromptu shield, she tries to prevent the smell from swallowing them whole. Mari's fanning motion, though genuine in its intent, provides only minimal relief from the all-encompassing presence of the smell, making her feel weighed down emotionally and physically.Realizing the absurdity of the situation, Luana decides to capitalize on Mari's misfortune and affectionately coins a nickname for Mari. Giggling and grasping her nose, she smirks at her friend:Luana (Portuguese with English subtitle): You know, Mari, I should start calling you \\"Pepe Le Pew,\\" isn't that a suitable nickname?Luana's playful teasing shines through, lifting their spirits and enabling them to find some levity in an otherwise embarrassing and deeply uncomfortable circumstance. The newly assigned nickname - 'Pepe Le Pew' - serves as a light-hearted way for both women to remember and chuckle at this unforgettable incident."},{"question":"Оригинальный сюжет игры Ben and Ed:Игра “Ben and Ed” - это трехмерный платформер, где игрок управляет зомби по имени Эд, который должен преодолевать множество препятствий и ловушек, чтобы спасти своего лучшего друга, мальчика по имени Бен.

Run Zombie, RUN!END OF PAGE 30 OF 150FEEDBACK AND SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT:I am glad to see your engagement with the script and concern for the effectiveness of the dialogue and overall narrative. I will provide feedback based on the first page, as requested:Page 1:- The opening line spoken by Ed, “Science today gives shape to tomorrow’s reality. Let’s push boundaries,” sets an ambitious and pioneering tone for his character and the movie’s thematic focus on scientific advancement. It effectively introduces Ed as a visionary and key driving force behind the plot. The brevity and clarity of this dialogue also make it easily digestible for the audience.- The dialogue between Ed and Maria post-work illustrates their deep personal and professional relationship. Maria’s toast, “A toast to our love and the dawn of a new era in science,” while crisp and meaningful, could be diversified to avoid the potential cliché of ‘toasting’ scenes. Consider adding unique character traits or backstory elements to make the moment stand out.- Their kiss as “an ECHO in the void, a prelude to the TURMOIL ahead” effectively uses foreshadowing. However, the actual conversation before this moment doesn’t convey as much about their relationship as it could. Is there playful banter, supportive dialogue, or philosophical musings that can occur here to add depth to their connection?- Overall, the dialogue appears clear and advances the plot as intended for the first page, though it stays within traditional conventions. Considering the film’s genre and the challenge of establishing context quickly, this works adequately, but moments that reveal the characters’ unique voices or vulnerabilities might further engage the audience.Suggestions for improvement:- Infuse additional personal details into the dialogue to provide viewers with a more intimate understanding of the characters.- Avoid potentially overused tropes by enriching the interactions with subtle nuances, such as their shared history or individual quirks, which can add layers to the conversation.- Consider the pacing and flow of the dialogue, ensuring it feels natural and consistent with the characters’ established personalities.The introduction sets up the story effectively, but digging deeper into the characters’ personalities and dynamic early on can strengthen the viewers’ emotional investment in their journey.Certainly! Continuing with the feedback on Page 2 of your provided screenplay:Page 2:- The inner monologue from Ed, “The breakthrough we’re on… it’s unprecedented,” conveys his exhilaration about the scientific progress. It succinctly captures his dedication. However, this dialog can be less explicit and more showing. Consider integrating Ed’s enthusiasm into interactions with his team members or the results they’re discussing, making it feel like a natural part of the scene rather than direct exposition.- Maria’s words, “It’s remarkable, Ed. You’re on the cusp of changing everything,” introduces the scale of their scientific endeavor but may benefit from deeper emotional layers. To elevate the intimacy and the gravity of their work, you could include personal stakes or how this breakthrough might uniquely affect their lives.- The intimate exchange as Ed administers the injection to the rat (“Once we crack this code, immortality won’t be myth; it will be SCIENCE”) showcases the characters’ shared vision. Yet, this is a moment where personal and ethical implications could also come to the forefront, perhaps through a nuanced question or a contemplative remark from Maria, thus adding complexity to the scene.- The page ends with applause and a toast, “To science! To endless possibilities. To us!” The triumphant tone is appropriate given the context of the scene; however, the dialogue risks falling into a trope. Each character’s individual reaction to this event could ground the scene more in personal experience and provide further insight into their personalities and motivations.Suggestions for improvement:- Provide subtext in the dialogue through which characters reveal their personalities, concerns, or unspoken tensions underlying the celebratory moment.- Balance Ed’s professional tone with personal elements that hint at the weight of their discovery beyond the lab’s walls.- Rather than having characters reiterate the significance of their work outright, allow the environment (reaction of the team, the energy in the room, visual cues) to communicate the success and implications.Your Page 2 establishes the excitement around the scientific breakthrough effectively. Still, the addition of character-driven nuances and heightened stakes through dialogue would enrich the storytelling and enhance audience connection with Ed and Maria’s journey.Analyzing the dialogue and narrative style for Page 3 of your screenplay:Page 3:- The dialogue during the Genesis Conference Hall presentation effectively establishes Ed as a confident and visionary leader in his field. His proclamation, “Today, we stand at the cusp of a revolution—a breakthrough that could render aging obsolete,” carries the weight of potential societal transformation. While the dialogue shows his confidence, it may also benefit from highlighting potential conflicts or challenges they’ve overcome to reach this point, making the scene not just a moment of triumph but also one of reflection.- Maria’s exchange with her colleague (“This is more than an experiment—it’s a peek into a future graced with the gift of unending youth.”), while succinct and thematic, would have more impact if it also suggested an understanding of the broader implications of their research. It’s an opportunity to explore her personal take on what they are doing, which can give the audience a richer sense of her character.- An audience member’s interjection concerning ethics is a compelling element that injects a sense of reality and consequences into the celebration (“Dr. Kaynes, what ethical considerations have been addressed here?”). However, the response given by Ed might seem too concise for such a complex issue. Exploring this dialogue further could open the narrative up to deeper philosophical questions and tension.- The dialogue at the end of the page, where Ed and Maria share a silent acknowledgment, is a strong visual that consolidates their partnership. Yet, their public response to the ethical question can also provide a moment of contrast against their personal views. It can be an opportunity to introduce hints of doubt or concern that they might harbor privately.Suggestions for improvement:- Offer a glimpse into the ethical debates surrounding their work beyond the enthusiastic acceptance, providing a more nuanced view of the characters’ world and the potential consequences of their breakthrough.- Explore Maria’s perspective and her balance between sharing Ed’s vision and acknowledging the gravity of their discovery – perhaps with a more conflicted or contemplative line.- Allow the applause to be interrupted by a handful of dissenting or concerned voices, illustrating that not everyone is ready to accept their “revolution” without question – this can hint at conflict that will develop later in the script.Page 3 succeeds in painting a picture of professional acclaim but consider fleshing out the characters’ inner worlds and the societal ripple effect of their work to deepen the narrative and set up future conflicts.Continuing with the analysis precisely for Page 4 of your screenplay:Page 4:- The intimacy in the dialogues between Ed and Maria (“To us, beyond the science and the spotlight.”) in their private living room scene is effectively contrasted with the public atmosphere of the previous page. It’s reflective and personal, reinforcing their bond. However, you could add more texture to this conversation by weaving in subtle references to their shared past or details that allude to their individual apprehensions or hopes.- When Maria asks for a toast “beyond science and the spotlight,” it grounds their relationship in something deeper than their professional achievements. Consider deepening this by adding an aspect of their life which is distinct from, and possibly compromised by, their professional ambitions.- Ed’s reply, capturing the “miracle” of their love, is a touching sentiment but risks veering into cliché. You might consider how each character uniquely expresses affection based on their personalities to keep the dialogue fresh and poignant.- Their dance and the detailed description of the moment (“Laughter mingles with music—a rare cadence of careless joy”) provide a pleasant sensory experience for the audience. However, punctuating this scene with more subtext or internal conflict can amplify the significance of these carefree moments against their otherwise high-stakes life.Suggestions for improvement:- Expand the dialogue to include more distinctive phrases or references that are unique to Maria and Ed’s relationship, making their interaction stand out as genuinely their own.- Introduce a brief moment of foreshadowing or concern here — a gaze out the window, a lingering touch, a shadow passing by — that subtly disrupts their joy and hints at the turmoil ahead.- Have Ed or Maria articulate a personal dream or fear that has nothing to do with their work, giving more dimension to their characters and foreshadowing the potential costs of their scientific ambitions.On Page 4, you skillfully shift from a public to a private domain, emphasizing the multifaceted lives of your characters. While the tenderness between Ed and Maria is clear, deepening their dialogue to reveal more nuanced emotions and internal conflicts can add complexity, setting up for the challenges they will face later in the narrative.Analyzing specifically Page 5 of your screenplay:Page 5:- The page opens with a gripping alarm scene, introducing a sudden shift in tone from the previous intimate atmosphere to a sense of impending danger. Ed’s dialogue, “Alert the team… It’s the rat… It’s RESURRECTED,” is direct and clear, effectively ramping up tension. This abrupt shift is engaging but also risks feeling a bit jarring if not adequately foreshadowed in previous scenes.- The shock and horror are aptly conveyed through the dramatic turn of events and Ed’s reaction. However, the emotional impact on Ed could be explored further. This could be achieved by adding a beat where he processes what he’s seeing on the monitors before jumping into action, thus allowing the gravity of the situation to sink in for both Ed and the audience.- The use of technical language (“Alert the team… It’s the rat… It’s RESURRECTED.”) works to establish his scientific background, but it’s also a moment where you could introduce some more character-specific language or mannerisms that reflect how Ed uniquely handles crises.- The phrase “twitches, resurrecting into a GHASTLY VERMIN” packs a visceral punch and vividly portrays the threat. However, the physicality of the rat’s transformation might be expanded upon to heighten the horror, potentially through Ed’s description or reaction.Suggestions for improvement:- Use this moment to delve deeper into Ed’s psyche; brief fragments of internal monologue could capture his initial disbelief and slowly dawning realization of the consequences.- Given the shock value of the situation, consider showing a moment of vulnerability or hesitation in Ed’s actions — does he immediately spring into problem-solving mode, or is there a moment of paralysis as the horrific implications of the experiment gone wrong hit him?- To enhance the realism, the dialogue could reflect a more natural response to crisis, potentially with fragmented sentences or interruptions as Ed attempts to communicate under duress.This page serves as a critical turning point, transitioning from the introduction of the characters’ personal and professional lives to the unleashing of the central conflict. It’s effective at initiating the core plot’s momentum; by infusing additional character-specific reactions and providing a more nuanced depiction of Ed’s response, the gravity of the situation can be amplified, and the narrative tension can be further escalated.I appreciate your engagement with the script and your focus on improving dialogue quality. Here’s the feedback for Page 6 of your script:Page 6:- Ed’s motivating dialogue to his team, “Prepare the PROTOTYPE! We’re making history with every test!”, successfully conveys his leadership and the high stakes of their work. Nonetheless, this line could sound generic, and infusing it with more of Ed’s unique voice or established character traits could enhance authenticity.- The transition to the view of Science City through the montage is a solid narrative device that broadens the scope and showcases the city’s innovative spirit. Still, there might be an opportunity to juxtapose the energy of the city with a subtle indication of underlying tensions or foreboding elements that hint at the upcoming chaos.- The team’s response to Ed (“Prepare for revelation, everyone. Our vision, our reality!”) displays their dedication and enthusiasm but drops a chance to introduce individual characters’ perspectives or concerns within the lab, which could add depth and potential side stories.- The palpable anticipation leading up to the presentation (“Ladies and gentlemen, to the dawn of a new world unbowed by time!”) has cinematic grandeur but might benefit from a balanced, grounded lead-up that also showcases the pressure and doubts characters like Ed might feel.Suggestions for improvement:- Personalize Ed’s pep talk with his distinctive style or incorporate him responding to a specific question from his team that illustrates the nuances of the prototype they’re developing.- Integrate foreshadowing elements subtly within the city montage—a glimpse of an issue that could stem from or relate to their research, for instance.- Diversify the lab team’s dialogue to include varying perspectives or hints at their individual stakes in the project’s success, as this could enhance the tension and offer a richer character palette.- In the lead-up to Ed’s final speech, consider showing him taking a reflective, possibly anxious moment, adding to his character’s depth and setting the stage for the gravitas of the official presentation.On Page 6, the script maintains its forward momentum, positioning Ed as the driving force of their scientific enterprise. Deepening the dialogue to showcase a more complex team dynamic and infusing the buildup to the presentation with personal conflict can offer a more nuanced portrayal of the story’s central figures and magnify the impending sense of disruption.Providing feedback on Page 7 of your screenplay:Page 7:- The environment of the “GENEsis LAB - R&D DEPARTMENT,” as captured through Ed’s directive (“Today, we make leaps, not steps. Let’s ensure our NAMES go down in HISTORY.”), effectively sets a scene of scientific rigor and ambition. However, the dialogue risks sounding melodramatic. Consider adding a layer of specificity or a moment that characterizes the lab work in a more nuanced way to truly emphasize the historic importance of this day for Ed and his team.- Maria’s responsive remark regarding the “CELL’S REGENERATION” hints at the magnitude of their research and acts as a narrative exposition. To enhance the depth of her character, it might be useful to see her grapple with the immediate scientific excitement versus the long-term implications of their work.- Moving to the “GENEsis LABORATORY - HALLWAY” and the buildup to Ed’s speech, the dialogue (\\"Prepare for revelation, everyone. Our vision, our reality!) serves to underscore the importance of the presentation. Yet, the opportunity to provide more personal stakes or reflections by individuals in Ed’s team is again missed, which could add a layer of complexity and tension to the scene.- In the “PRESENTATION ROOM,” Ed’s dialogue sets up anticipation (“With every second we unveil MYSTERIES once bound to THE REALM OF GODS!”). This grand statement provides a sense of the transformative potential of their work, but Ed’s claim would benefit from a contrasting view within the room to highlight the diversity of reactions such a bold statement might elicit.Suggestions for improvement:- Avoid hyperbole in Ed’s directives, instead injecting his dialogue with specifics about the research at hand or acknowledging the combined efforts and unique talents of his team members.- Explore Maria’s intellectual and ethical curiosity further; as Ed’s partner, she could express both pride and caution, reflecting the duality of their groundbreaking work’s potential outcomes.- Introduce micro-tensions or subtle interpersonal dynamics within the team that signal varying levels of commitment or concern about the announcement, to add depth to their shared goal.- Infuse the buildup to Ed’s speech with a blend of anticipation and anxiety. Perhaps an assistant or a technical glitch momentarily interrupts him—a detail that reveals Ed’s ability to manage unpredictability and foreshadows future complications.Page 7 continues to sell the grandeur of Ed and Maria’s achievements and the beam of hope they represent for human advancement. By focusing more closely on individual character moments, the impending sense of consequence their work may bring could be accentuated, providing a richer backdrop for the story’s climax.Absolutely, here is the feedback for Page 8 of your screenplay:Page 8:- The description of the “GENEsis LABORATORY - LOBBY” in preparation for a significant event with Maria greeting guests provides a setup that illustrates the LAB employing a public-facing role. Her dialogue, “Welcome all! A remarkable day awaits us,” sets an inviting, yet formal tone. This could be enhanced by adding a personal touch or nuance, reflecting Maria’s thoughts on the event’s potential repercussions or her anticipation for the day.- Dr. Kim’s compliment to Maria, “Maria, your work is awe-inspiring!” while positive, feels predictable. Developing their interaction with more unique dialogue or touching on their shared history or scientific opinions can add layers to both characters.- The alcove conversation (“This could change everything, for better or worse!”) is an excellent technique to introduce secondary characters’ perspectives, concerns, and the potential ethical dilemmas of the LAB’s work. The dialogue achieves this but may benefit from showing specifics that the featured figures are worried about, making their concerns more tangible and impactful to the story.- Maria’s subsequent dialogue with Dr. Kim feels a bit on-the-nose. The statement, “Indeed, a door to the future is opening,” sounds too abstract. It may be more effective to show them discussing the practical applications of their work or the societal changes they expect, grounding their conversation in concrete terms.Suggestions for improvement:- To increase the richness of dialogue, consider adding subtext that hints at the characters’ complex emotions or reservations regarding the momentous day. This would both deepen the characters and foreshadow the potential consequences of their work.- Explore more personalized greetings from Maria or comments from guests that indicate the LAB’s impact on different societal sectors, perhaps including subtle hints of dissent or unease among excitement.- Use the private alcove debate to delve into more nuanced discussions about the implications of the lab’s work, offering viewers insight into varied societal viewpoints and increasing tension.- Develop Maria’s dialogue to reflect her layered relationship with Dr. Kim and her own internal conflict about their work ahead of the day’s big reveal. It could cement Maria’s character as one with depth and personal stakes in the work beyond scientific achievement.Page 8 maintains the momentum of the narrative as it leads up to the pivotal reveal. The dialogue and interactions are functional but lack the complexity that could come from showcasing the characters’ more profound inner lives or the gravity of the day’s events. Heightening the emotional subtext and including more varied reactions would enhance the dialogue’s impact and create a more textured buildup to the subsequent dramatic events.I am ready to provide feedback on Page 9 of your screenplay. Here’s the analysis:Page 9:- The dramatic unveiling of the project, as detailed in Ed’s dialogue (“Ladies and gentlemen, today we stand on the brink of a new frontier in science.”), succeeds in giving off a sense of historic importance. However, his speech may benefit from the inclusion of a personal anecdote or a reference to the journey they’ve had, offering a glimpse into his own vulnerabilities or sacrifices made for the sake of their research.- The audience’s reaction, filled with applause and cheers, is an understandable response, yet it might be interesting to vary these reactions to reflect a range of emotions and to foreshadow any potential conflicts or oppositions to their grandiose claims.- Maria’s pride in the crowd and her non-verbal communication with Ed adds a neat, cinematic layer to the scene, seamlessly aligning the personal with the professional. It could be enhanced by deepening the understanding of Maria as an individual; perhaps she has mixed feelings or specific reasons for why their success means so much to her personally.- Ed’s bold claim about “rewriting the narrative of human life” is powerful and sets up the scope for what’s to come. Nevertheless, it could be juxtaposed with a brief, subtle counterpoint in the scene — maybe a character in the audience showing skepticism or concern — to introduce an undercurrent of opposition or ethical doubt in the narrative.Suggestions for improvement:- Provide Ed with a personal story or reflection that he can share during his presentation to make the science more relatable and palpable for the audience. This could humanize the implications of their work and ground his character.- Integrate a wider array of reactions among the audience to highlight the diverse ethical and social reactions their announcement could provoke, thereby creating a richer narrative texture and priming viewers for conflict.- Offer more insight into Maria’s internal world during the presentation. Perhaps she can have an aside or internal monologue that divulges her true feelings about their discovery and its wider societal impact.- Consider introducing a credible voice of dissent or skepticism among the supporters to add narrative tension and create a more realistic, multi-faceted response to the prospect of rewriting human life’s narrative.Page 9 of the screenplay effectively communicates the weight of Ed and Maria’s breakthrough and conveys their triumphant moment. To provide more depth and set the stage for the conflicts that will arise from their discovery, consider dialing up the personal stakes and introducing hints of the challenges that lie ahead.Of course, here’s the feedback focusing on Page 10 of your screenplay:Page 10:- Ed’s triumphant declaration about the rat named PHOENIX and the “Elixir of Life” efficiently captures the cinematic reveal of a central plot device. The boldness of the statement fits the moment, but taking the time to show a closer view of PHOENIX reacting to the elixir, with observers’ reactions interspersed, would bolster the scene’s dramatic impact.- The scenes with crowds responding en masse can detract from personal emotional engagement. While cheers and applause may be a realistic response, they limit the depth of individual character reactions. Introducing cutaways to key characters in the audience who react differently — whether with skepticism, concern, or personal interest — would enhance engagement and tease future plot complications.- Ed’s bold claim, “Today, we turn the page, facing tomorrow’s SUNRISE—timeless and untamed!” is suitably grand; however, without grounding it with personal stakes or presenting a visible reaction from the team, it runs the risk of feeling detached. A contrasting perspective from either Maria or another character could introduce a valuable narrative layer, suggesting the dawn of this new world is not without potential darkness.- The page culminates in their collective triumph, yet the dialogue risks falling into a triumphant cliché. It might benefit from the introduction of a narrative element that subtly undercuts the milestone, such as a behind-the-scenes problem, to seed conflict and foreshadow future challenges.Suggestions for improvement:- Break the monolithic crowd response into individual threads — key figures can offer whispered comments, raised eyebrows, or looks of consternation that speak volumes without uttering a word, thus diversifying the reception.- Incorporate more nuanced reactions or dialogues from Maria and the team members during the presentation to showcase a spectrum of perspectives and add depth to the shared experience.- Consider Ed’s own reflections on the presentation’s implications and the effect their breakthrough will have on his personal life. A moment of contemplation or doubt could provide an additional dimension to his character.- Offer a glimpse into potential ethical or logistical concerns that the “Elixir of Life” might raise. This might include a brief side conversation between characters or a visual cue that not everything is as perfect as it seems.Page 10 continues to build upon the central narrative event, solidifying Ed and Maria’s scientific triumph. By interspersing individual reactions and underlying doubts within the public spectacle, you can weave a richer tapestry that not only showcases the wonder of their achievement but also foreshadows the complex ramifications of their “Elixir of Life.”Analyzing Page 11 of your screenplay:Page 11:- Ed’s engagement with the audience regarding ethical considerations, “ETHICS in science is our compass—steering the ship of discovery in RESPONSIBLE waters,” is pivotal for establishing the moral compass of the characters. However, the dialogue may benefit from showcasing a more nuanced exploration of the concerns being raised, perhaps by allowing Ed to cite a specific example that reflects his and the lab’s commitment to ethical considerations.- The Reporter’s inquiry about accessibility (“What of inequality? How will the ELIXIR be ACCESSIBLE?”) is an excellent moment, prompting a discussion that delves into the societal implications of their discovery. While Maria’s response is articulate, it might be further enriched by showing a glimpse of the dynamics between the researchers and policymakers. This would highlight the complexity of applying such a profound scientific breakthrough to society.- A BIOETHICIST’s question about the potential cost to society introduces a critical voice that enriches the dialogue by painting a picture of the debate surrounding their work. Ed’s reassurance of careful advancement might carry more weight if paired with a previous instance illustrating their commitment to caution.- The applause from the crowd, signaling solidarity and support, could perhaps be somewhat subdued or mixed with whispers of dissent to continue layering the public’s range of reactions to the breakthrough.Suggestions for improvement:- Present a moment where Ed or Maria references a particular protocol or past decision that exemplifies their dedication to ethics, grounding their lofty dialogue in concrete examples.- Include not just assurances from Maria but also perhaps her acknowledgement of the difficult road ahead in ensuring fair access, reflecting her awareness of the challenging reality.- Allow for some audience members to exhibit visible reactions to the bioethicist’s concern—some nodding in agreement, others looking concerned or perhaps unconvinced—thus highlighting the variety of public opinions.- Ed’s confident proclamation of their approach to risk could tie back to personal experiences or previous setbacks, which might offer the audience a more intimate understanding of how both he and Maria view their responsibility to society.Page 11 does well in portraying Ed and Maria as mindful of the broader implications of their scientific work. However, deepening the dialogue to include specific references to past actions and showing the array of public responses can provide a more robust, multi-faceted narrative that underscores the complexities entwined with groundbreaking scientific discovery.Providing feedback tailored to Page 12 of your screenplay:Page 12:- The elegant reception juxtaposed with sophisticated conversations serves as an excellent backdrop for the unfolding drama. The interactions, particularly that of Chancellor West (“Remarkable, Ed! The city’s abuzz with excitement.”), convey the public support and recognition. However, the dialogue might seem formal and lacking in individual distinctiveness. A more personal exchange would add depth. Perhaps Chancellor West could share a brief, personal sentiment or a piece of wisdom that hints at the weight of their achievements.- The debate between Dr. Rosenberg and Ms. Sharpe in the private alcove introduces a thematic counterpoint to the public celebration. Their concerns (“The box is opened… can they now control what spills forth?”) are essential for sewing seeds of doubt. Building on this dynamic by incorporating a balanced dialogue that reflects specific fears could enhance the gravity of their words.- Maria and Ed’s interaction with the young investors has the right mix of excitement and groundedness. While celebratory, there is an opportunity here to capture a more complex texture by subtly portraying Ed and Maria’s apprehension, like a visual cue that implies their internal worries despite the veneer of confidence.- The scene captures the intellectual solidarity behind the couple with lines like “To a NEW AGE! An era defined by your vision!” While the dialogue successfully conveys the investors’ enthusiasm, it might benefit from displaying more nuanced investor interests or concerns, as this would provide a realistic portrayal of their response to such a game-changing innovation.Suggestions for improvement:- Include specific, character-driven responses from the Chancellor that offer a perspective on the implications of the breakthrough from the city’s leadership point of view.- Expand on the private conversation between Dr. Rosenberg and Ms. Sharpe. They could discuss actual incidents or data that ground their ethical and control-related concerns, rather than speaking in hypotheticals.- When investors toast to “a new age,” showing Ed or Maria having an aside conversation or an internal reflection might unveil their own concerns about what ‘the new age’ really entails for humanity.- Perhaps frame the triumphant moment with a subtle, dissonant undercurrent—something as simple as a spilled drink or a flickering light that doesn’t demand much attention but visually echoes the notion of imperfection and foreshadows future discord.On Page 12, you’ve depicted a multi-layered scene that ranges from public admiration to Intellectual contemplation. While the script continues to set a celebratory tone for Ed and Maria’s breakthrough, injecting moments of private reflection or conflict would enrich the scene’s emotional complexity. By providing more personalized and conflicting viewpoints, the celebrations can transition from a moment of unequivocal joy to a more thought-provoking scenario, leading to a more intriguing plot development as the story progresses.Here is the feedback specific to Page 13 of your screenplay:Page 13:- The scene in Maria’s office (“Today was extraordinary, Ed. But I feel unease…”) offers a moment for introspection and foreshadowing. Maria’s admission shows her sense of foreboding and adds emotional depth. Yet, the dialogue could dive deeper, perhaps conveying specific fears or doubts about their work’s ethical ramifications, to provide a fuller picture of her internal conflict.- Ed’s reassuring embrace and response (“Today, we stepped into the unknown, trusting in our work…”) acknowledge the risk inherent in their scientific endeavors. However, expanding on Ed’s emotional response could reinforce his character development, showing a side of Ed that grapples with the consequences rather than merely offsetting Maria’s concerns with optimism.- The visual of the couple looking out upon the city skyline is powerful. To enhance this, consider adding a dialogue or action that creates a personal connection to the city — perhaps it is the place they met, or they muse about how the city has changed. This personal attachment could serve to underscore the stakes of their actions for them as individuals, not just as scientists.- The final dialogue of Ed (“The future rests in our vigilance…”) solidifies their joint commitment to their work’s potential risks. While the message is clear, Ed’s dialogue might be further developed to express acknowledgment of the many uncontrollable variables that come with playing god — a daunting reality that would naturally weigh on their consciences.Suggestions for improvement:- Give more depth to Maria’s reflection by including an anecdote or memory that grounds her unease in personal experience, connecting her emotions to concrete events or possibilities.- Instead of Ed immediately providing comfort, allow him a moment to process Maria’s concerns, reflecting his own struggle with the dual nature of their promise and threat to humanity.- As they look out over the city, have them recall a more innocent time or make a parallel between their growth and the city’s evolution, which can draw a poignant contrast with the threat looming over it.- When Ed speaks of the future, incorporating a dialogue that acknowledges the fine line they’re treading and the precarious balance of their ambitions against the risks involved can add nuance to his outlook.The scene on Page 13 does well to contrast the public adulation with private vulnerability, offering a glimpse into Maria’s trepidations and Ed’s unwavering support. By expanding on their internal dialogues and emotions, revealing their shared history, and enhancing their connection to the larger narrative, the script can build greater empathy for Maria and Ed and set the groundwork for the ethical and emotional trials that lie ahead.Certainly! Here is the tailored feedback for Page 14 of your screenplay:Page 14:- The transitional moment to Ed and Maria’s home after their achievement (“The decisions we’ve made… they’ll define us, Ed.”) is emotionally insightful, providing a thematic bridge between their public success and private concerns. Yet, the dialogue as structured leans towards the expositional. It may benefit from more subtlety and show the nuances of their apprehension through actions — perhaps finger-tracing a photo from their past or a hesitant pause before turning off the last light in the lab.- The reference to the cosmos and their dance beneath the stars (“Together, we are an UNBREAKABLE force against the tempest’s FURY.”) captures their romantic unity well, but adding a layer that reflects on the contrast between their control over nature’s laws and their submission to the laws of the cosmos could add a poetic depth to the moment.- The language and descriptions are vivid (“…as they stand beneath the cosmos. The FLICKER of candles is a testament to their enduring bond.”); however, the script could provide a closer look into their personal dynamics. For instance, displaying a moment of gentle humor or shared secret that only they understand could further personalize their relationship.- The scene sets an intimate tone but also provides an opportunity to plant seeds of further conflict (“This tranquility… May it shield us from the GALE that awaits.”). Drawing a subtle connection to their inner fears about the upcoming challenges — maybe a troubling call they postpone answering — would serve to subtly ramp up the tension for the audience.Suggestions for improvement:- Introduce body language or actions that betray Maria’s or Ed’s inner turmoil without explicit dialogue. Perhaps they hold hands but with a grip that reveals underlying tension.- Consider giving Ed a line that inadvertently reveals his awareness that they cannot control everything — mirroring the unpredictable nature of the universe around them.- Utilize their serene environment for juxtaposition — a silent moment where both characters’ gazes might reveal concern or doubt, indicating that not all is as serene as it seems.- As they bask in the safety of the night away from the public eye, incorporate subtext into their dialogue suggesting that their outward confidence masks an understanding that their successes come with potential consequences they have yet to face.Page 14 emphasizes the loving bond of the two characters, focusing on their momentary peace amidst the implied brewing storm. By introducing subtle signs of conceivable foreboding and deepening the dialogue with intimate expressions unique to their relationship, the scene could amplify the emotional intensity and groundwork for the future developments woven throughout your narrative.Here’s the analysis tailored for Page 15 of your screenplay:Page 15:- The stillness of the car scene contrasted with the “silent murmur of the city” subtly sets up a reflective space for Ed and Maria to converse, isolated from the external world. Their banter, hinted at in lines like “Just another day at the office for the Kaynes duo,” can enhance the depth of their relationship by balancing professional achievements with their personal rapport. However, expanding this into an exchange that hints at the emotional cost of their work could foster even greater intimacy in their dynamic.- The tension in their shared promise (“No matter what tomorrow brings, we face it together, Ed. Side by side, come what may.”) effectively communicates the solidity of their relationship while foreshadowing the challenges ahead. Yet, this moment could be improved by juxtaposing the comfort of their embrace against a backdrop of subtle environmental unease, perhaps the flickering of a distant light or the rustling of wind — elements that insinuate disturbances in their safe haven.- Ed’s conviction (“As long as we have each other, Maria. We can face eternity.”) reaffirms their mutual dependency and strength, which is a recurring theme. To reinforce this message without redundancy, consider introducing a vulnerability in Ed — an unsteady breath or a lingering look at Maria that suggests even he is unnerved by the journey ahead, despite his confident words.- The dialogue hints at a broader emotional spectrum but remains within expected parameters of romantic reassurance. To add complexity, integrate indications of personal longing, unfulfilled dreams, or remnants of fear that tug at the fabric of their shared professional front.Suggestions for improvement:- Add layers to their in-car dialogue with subtextual cues that allude to personal sacrifices made or anxiety about the impact of their work on societal norms and personal lives.- Utilizing the car as a metaphorical vessel moving through the night, convey that while they’re together on this journey, outside forces — like the ones they have unleashed — are beyond anyone’s control.- Ed’s line about facing eternity together could link back to a previous instance of shared joy, a scientific dilemma, or a personal trial that they overcame, grounding their bond in shared experiences rather than just forward-looking pronouncements.- Introduce a subtle sense of foreboding into the scene — a sudden silence in their laughter, a fleeting sense of discomfort, or an unexpected reminder of the chaos they’ve left behind at the lab — to contrast with the notion of their safety and control.Page 15 captures a raw, emotional moment for Ed and Maria that reflects the steadfastness of their bond amid looming challenges. Deepening their exchange with personal revelations and incorporating understated signs of apprehension can enrich the narrative, providing a contrast between their profound connection and the unpredictability of the future they’re facing.Continuing with the focused feedback for Page 16 of your screenplay:Page 16:- Ed and Maria’s evening at home is depicted as a peaceful respite from their daylight achievements. The toast, “To the miracle of you, the REAL discovery of my life,” exemplifies Ed’s deep affection for Maria. However, this line could verge into familiar territory and might be made more effective with a unique twist that expresses Ed’s feelings in a way that’s characteristic of the personal language they share as a couple.- The description of their dance and intimate interaction is touching, yet without additional context, it risks echoing similar romantic scenes. Introducing a specific memory they share or an element that connects back to their scientific or moral journey would add originality and depth, anchoring their personal exchange in the unique fabric of their lives.- Maria’s reply, “As long as we STAND together, no MYSTERY too vast, no challenge too daunting,” affirms their partnership’s strength. To enhance its narrative power, consider adding a personal anecdote or introspective comment that acknowledges the paradoxes they’ve faced — underscoring her optimism with realistic underpinnings.- The scene’s close focuses on the ephemeral nature of their contentment. Reiterating their triumph (“They stand, the architects of a future written on their terms.”) does well to remind us of the larger narrative at play. Still, the inclusion of an interrupting element — such as an urgent phone call they choose to ignore — could subtextually question the stability and control they believe they possess.Suggestions for improvement:- Refine Ed’s expression of sentiment by tying it to a specific event or shared interest that accentuates the uniqueness of their relationship and personal journey.- During their revelry, leverage their environment or a nostalgic object within the scene to evoke a fond yet poignant memory, deepening the emotional resonance of their celebration.- Have Maria’s dialogue reflect a juxtaposition of her external confidence with an internal admission of the daunting nature of their achievements and the shadows these cast upon their future.- Introduce a subtle instance of discord during their tender moment that hints at the impending turbulence — a reminder that although they may be architects of the future, they are not fully in control of the foundation upon which they’re building.Page 16 effectively portrays a private moment of companionship and underscored triumph between Ed and Maria, serving as a poignant counterpoint to their public personas. By adding personalized elements and a hint of imminent conflict to their dialogue, the screenplay can create a more nuanced portrayal of their relationship and the consequences of their groundbreaking work.Certainly, here’s the analysis for Page 17 of your screenplay:Page 17:- The juxtaposition of the stormy exterior with the passionate encounter between Ed and Maria adds a dramatic and sensual layer to the story. The restoration of intimacy (“their LOVE overflows; a TANGIBLE ENERGY undulates through the AIR”) works well, but consider further enriching this scene by reflecting on the dichotomy between their control in professional life and surrender to nature’s unpredictability.- The depiction of their passionate display, while framed tastefully, could benefit from focusing on the emotional stakes of their relationship, as much as their physical connection (“MOONLIGHT streams through the WINDOW, casting ghostly RAYS…”). Perhaps interlacing their dialogues or thoughts about fears and aspirations amidst their intimacy could elevate the scene’s emotional quotient.- Their lovemaking represents a moment of unchecked human desire amidst their rigid scientific pursuits. To ensure this scene doesn’t feel cliché or out of place within the larger narrative, ground it with callbacks to their shared history or even worries about the future they are actively shaping.- The narrative twist — the rat stirring and its ominous resurrection as Ed and Maria are preoccupied — is compelling. Nonetheless, it would resonate more if the preceding passion was mirrored later with regret or a sense of omission due to their preoccupation, highlighting the theme of consequence.Suggestions for improvement:- Interweave thoughts or dialogue that reveal their underlying concerns during their lovemaking, constructing a contrast between their current bliss and the complexities of their reality.- As the story unfolds from passion to the rat’s sinister resurrection, parallel the ‘resurrection’ motif with dialogue or a symbolic element in the bedroom. Perhaps they knock over a picture or spill something unknowingly — a metaphor for unforeseen outcomes of their own making.- Include subtle nuances where Ed and Maria express unspoken desires or concerns for humanity amidst their love-making, to hint at the personal impacts of their ambitions.- After the passionate zenith, offer a moment where Ed and Maria, sated, fall into a reflective silence, pondering the fragile balance between their personal affections and the impending chaos that their work may unleash upon the world.In Page 17, you effectively contrast the tempestuous exterior with the storm raging within, expressing both Ed and Maria’s deep bond and the unforeseen forces they’ve inadvertently set into motion. Introducing forethought and personal reflection into their most vulnerable moments could serve to remind the audience of the broader narrative, further weaving the threads of their intimacy with the foreboding reality of their situation.Analyzing Page 18 of your screenplay with the same detailed approach:Page 18:- The sharp interruption of sleep by the phone call is a classic narrative device to signal an imminent crisis. Ed’s reluctant answer (“All right… all right.”) followed by an urgent message received is realistic and gripping. To intensify the moment, perhaps include a brief interaction where Maria senses something amiss before Ed confirms her fears, thereby enhancing the tension.- Maria’s immediate worry, followed by Ed’s assertive response to rush to the lab (“It’s gone wrong at the lab. We have to go. Now.”), illustrates their close partnership and shared responsibilities. Nonetheless, this could be further developed with a glimpse of their individual reactions to the situation. This would emphasize the gravity of the news without explicitly stating it and add emotional layers to the characters’ reactions.- The choppy transition from bed to lab (“blood drains from ED’s face as shockwaves ripple through his very being”) is evocative but leaves space for more nuanced storytelling. A visceral body reaction from Ed would simultaneously show his shock and allow the audience to better envision the stakes of what’s transpiring.- The scene ends with a SMASH CUT TO BLACK, which is a powerful directorial choice highlighting the abruptness of the situation. Consider splicing in a visual cue that underscores the breakneck pace of the unfolding emergency — a knocked over glass of water, a photograph knocked askew in their haste to leave — offering a visual metaphor for their disrupted lives.Suggestions for improvement:- Create a link between Ed’s grogginess and a sudden jerk into action to highlight his swift transition from personal to professional urgency, perhaps through Maria’s expression of concern or Ed’s abrupt movement.- Build Maria’s initial panic with prompts that reflect their shared consciousness of what might go wrong, even before Ed speaks. This could be done through a non-verleg dialogue showing her hurry to dress or pack essentials for a potential emergency situation.- Dive deeper into Ed’s physical reactions to the news with descriptive language that portrays not just shock, but also the dawning realization and the weight of their actions that is crashing upon him.- Add a visual cue of disarray in their home, symbolizing their world turning chaotic — a reflection of how the external chaos caused by their scientific breakthrough has started to penetrate their personal sanctuary.Page 18 is pivotal as it forces Ed and Maria to confront the consequences of their work head-on. By focusing on the characters’ individual responses to the crisis and including extra visual details, you have the potential to strengthen viewers’ emotional connection to your protagonists. This will set the stage for the characters to reckon with the reality of their choices and amplify the sense of urgency that propels them into the action that follows.Continuing with the targeted feedback for Page 19 of your screenplay:Page 19:- The scene in Ed’s laboratory is effectively chaotic, with the blaring security alarm presenting a clear sign of crisis escalation. However, the scene could benefit from more detailed reactions or a quick back-and-forth between Ed and the security guard, which would not only heighten urgency but also ground the action in reality.- Dr. Laura Stevens’ dialogue over the phone (“Ed, it’s chaos here. The test… it’s turned into an outbreak!”) efficiently conveys the severity of the outbreak. It might be enriched by adding personal concern for her colleague, which would underscore the relationship between characters and provide context for the panic.- The portrayal of the rat as a horrific symbol is a strong narrative choice. To further amplify the horror, consider including a description of the immediate impact of the rat’s behavior on other lab elements or personnel reactions as they discover the animal’s transformation, adding to the sense of dread.- The transition to Ed in the remote viewing room (“ED stands in his remote viewing room…”) is stark, which effectively places him in the position of an observer of his own nightmarish creation. To make this moment more powerful, perhaps have Ed reflect on the earlier cues of danger he overlooked, thereby connecting his character arc more directly to the unfolding mayhem.Suggestions for improvement:- Intensify the immediacy of the outbreak through descriptive language that not only details the actions being taken but also hints at Ed and the security team’s inner turmoil as they react.- Deepen the security guard’s sense of panic with layered dialogue that reveals his personal stakes in the safety of the lab — maybe he’s concerned for a colleague or a particular section of the lab.- As the rat’s resurrection unfolds, consider contrasting its grotesque reanimation with flashbacks or rapid thoughts of Ed’s previous observations, amplifying the regret and fear that it’s now unstoppable.- Integrate physical responses from Ed such as gripping the phone tighter, narrow misses as he hurries to control the situation, or a personal mantra to keep focused amidst chaos — humanizing him further and adding to the intensity of the crisis.Page 19 builds upon the tension and horror elements, escalating the stakes with the depiction of a critical and dangerous turning point. Enhancing character reactions and dialogue while balancing action and emotional resonance can convey the magnitude of the crisis, compelling the audience to feel the weight of what the characters are experiencing. Adding these personal touches and intensifying the urgency through Ed’s responses would enhance the emotional gravity of the situation and set the stage for the challenges ahead.Proceeding with the tailored feedback for Page 20 of your screenplay:Page 20:- The sequence of events from the characters’ hurried drive through the city at dawn to their arrival at the GENEsis LABORATORY develops a building sense of urgency and foreshadows the pivotal actions to follow. Ed and Maria’s determination is clear, but this could be heightened by small moments of doubt or fear that creep into their conversation or body language as they approach the lab — a tightening grip on the steering wheel, a quick exchange of worried glances.- The in-car dialogue as they prepare for what’s ahead (“We will contain this”) could use an extra beat to show both Ed’s and Maria’s character development. Instead of a straightforward affirmation, explore the possibility of them using their personal leitmotifs or shared experiences to reinforce their resolve, which can add emotional resonance to the scene.- The description of their race against time to the LABORATORY is visually engaging; however, adding environmental reactions to their urgency — like startled birds taking flight or a streetlight flickering out as they pass — could symbolically enhance the gravity of the situation.- The final lines of the page (“The sunlight struggles against the growing shadow of catastrophe enveloping the city”) is effectively metaphorical, aligning with the broader thematic tension. Fleshing out this metaphor, maybe by highlighting signs of normal life abruptly thwarted or by capturing the last remnants of calm before the full scale of the disaster is revealed, can underscore the impending calamity.Suggestions for improvement:- Introduce more personal, introspective dialogue during their car journey, allowing Ed and Maria to briefly reflect on the human cost of their choices, juxtaposing their professional resolve against their private apprehensions.- During the car ride, provide a moment of silence — a sudden pause in their conversation signifying a mutual realization of the enormity of the crisis — to let the weight of the situation settle on both them and the audience.- Expand the depiction of dawn as they drive, perhaps by drawing a parallel between the encroaching daylight and the growing darkness of the outbreak, deepening the irony of the setting.- Just before they step out at the LABORATORY, let there be a moment where Ed or Maria hesitates — a subtle nod to the fear of what they might find inside that stands in stark contrast to their outward bravery.Page 20 propels the narrative forward by transitioning Ed and Maria from the safety of their domestic sphere to the epicenter of the unfolding crisis. By incorporating more detailed environmental cues and personal emotional conflicts, the screenplay can provide a stronger sense of urgency as the characters move closer to the harsh realities awaiting them, intensifying the anticipation for what’s to come.Here is the focused feedback for Page 21 of your screenplay:Page 21:- The description of the GENESIS LABORATORY’s security situation (the security guard engaging the lockdown protocol) successfully communicates the immediacy of the threat, providing a solid image of the lab’s response to the crisis. To elevate the stakes even further, consider enhancing the guard’s dialogue with expressions of personal concern or including auditory cues, like the distant sound of chaos beyond the room.- DR. STEVENS’s line, “Communications are down. We’re blind to who’s left,” succinctly captures the tension of the moment and the heightened stakes for the characters. This dialogue could benefit from a follow-up expressing the implications of this breakdown, such as limiting their ability to warn others or hindering coordination with external emergency services.- The SHADOWS slinking through the streets marking the spread of the infection is a strong image. Here you could add more sensory details, such as a chilling breeze that Ed and Maria sense as they leave the car, which parallels the creeping fear and the invasive threat they face.- Ed’s solemn voice-over (“The Pandora’s box we opened…”) provides an insightful reflection on the situation. Yet, it could be paired effectively with a visual representation of the proverbial ‘Pandora’s box’ in the lab — a left-behind piece of equipment or an abandoned project — to visually underline the themes of unleashed catastrophe and lost control.- The transition from the laboratory’s internal lockdown to the streets’ deserted state paints a grim picture of the spreading disorder. Fleshing out these descriptions with more detailed accounts of the city’s descent into panic — such as visual or behavioral specifics of the infected — could further amplify the sense of dread.Suggestions for improvement:- Offer a glimpse into the security guard’s personal stakes within the situation through panicked mentions of needing to contact family or protect a particular co-worker, adding depth to the urgency.- DR. STEVENS’s dialogue could include a personal admission of fear for her own safety or for the unknown fate of her colleagues, increasing the emotional weight of her words.- Ed and Maria’s silent drive toward the lab could be intercut with more intimate, fearful exchanges between them, underlining their dread of what is to come and building emotional connection between them and the audience.- As they navigate the security hub, describe not only their actions but also the state of disarray in the lab around them, perhaps showing remnants of hastily evacuated workspaces or scattered personal items, which humanizes the crisis and the panic it induced.Page 21 does well in capturing the isolating and shocking nature of the crisis. However, enriching the dialogue with more direct emotive expressions and including sensory-driven descriptions could strengthen the characters’ internal experiences and highlight the devastating impact of the outbreak. This heightens the suspense as Ed and Maria move from their sanctuary and into action amidst the catastrophic event they inadvertently helped create.Delving into the feedback for Page 22 of your screenplay:Page 22:- The opening description of the city under a veil of darkness transitioning to morning sets a haunting tone, reinforcing the encroaching threat. The eerie scuffle in the alleyway, where the homeless man is attacked, is well portrayed. Nevertheless, this could be further enhanced by expanding on his experience — the chill of the air, the trash rustling nearby, the scent of impending rain — to deepen the reader’s immersion in the scene.- The urgency in the Genesis Laboratory’s response is palpable, with the guards activating protocols, but more personalized dialogue might emphasize the gravity of the situation. The guard’s alarm (“Code Red! The subject… it’s not dead, it’s—”) can become more evocative with a brief snapshot of the guard’s personal reaction to the rat’s sudden movement, like a shocked step backward or his hand quaking over the alarm button.- The NIGHT SHIFT SECURITY GUARD’s call to action (“Immediate RESPONSE needed…”) captures the emergency well. You might consider presenting the guard’s immediate decision-making or internal conflict — perhaps there’s a protocol to follow that he hesitates upon, showcasing the interplay between duty and panic.- The concluding image of the supposedly safe laboratory against the rising sun is illustrative, conveying the shift from order to chaos. To raise the impact of this scene, introduce foreshadowing elements: the early signs of disorder within the confines of the ‘beacon of light,’ such as security systems beginning to fail or scientists experiencing rising tension and fear.Suggestions for improvement:- Consider opening with a more in-depth description of the homeless man’s surroundings to build tension before the attack—details that would give readers a sense of false security that’s about to be shattered.- Provide a more visceral image or behavior of the attacking zombies to convey their menace and the infectious spread, ratcheting up the horror and urgency.- Infuse the dialogue with a moment or phrase that illustrates each character’s emotional state or exhibits their shock, such as the guard’s stutter or gasp, to increase the sense of immediacy.- Depict the morning light’s struggle as a metaphor for the oncoming struggle between order and chaos, potentially through the perspective of a lab scientist or an outside observer who remarks on the unsettling quiet of the morning.Page 22 effectively continues to set the tone of a city on the brink of disaster, with Ed and Maria as central figures poised to confront an unimaginable challenge. By focusing on the terror of the initial outbreak and the vulnerability of the lab’s defenses, you underline the themes of encroaching darkness and foreboding that escalate the narrative tension. Adding more sensory descriptions and character-specific responses can further personalize the sense of impending doom and heighten the emotional stakes for the audience.Reviewing Page 23 of your screenplay with the same level of detail:Page 23:- The depiction of chaos at the CITY HOSPITAL (“MEDICS and NURSES dash frantically”) effectively contrasts with ED and MARIA’s focused entrance into the GENEsis LABORATORY, highlighting the broader impact of the crisis versus the personal journey of our protagonists. To enhance this juxtaposition, try adding small conversational snippets between healthcare workers that reflect the overwhelmed nature of their response.- DR. MARTINEZ’s assertive command (“Isolate the critical ones — every second counts!”) provides a glimpse into the tension within the hospital. Building upon her call to action with an emotional inflection — perhaps an expression of desperation or weariness — could make her character more vivid.- The deserted park scene with the abandoned bike is poignant, yet to deepen its emotional gravity, consider layering in somber details of abandonment or interrupted life (a forgotten toy, an open lunchbox, a ringing phone in the distance).- The EMERGENCY BROADCAST CENTER scene conveys the panic of the situation; however, the NEWS ANCHOR’s tension might be further communicated through specific details, such as trembling hands or a cracked voice, as she attempts to maintain composure while informing the public.- When ED and MARIA navigate to the ‘antiviral vault,’ the straightforward statement (“The antiviral vault… our only CHANCE.”) makes their goal clear but could be elevated by internal dialogues that reveal their increasing realization of the heavy responsibility they carry to rectify the chaos.Suggestions for improvement:- Introduce layered dialogue among hospital staff that reflects personal stakes or reveals the rapidly deteriorating conditions, driving up the tension.- Imbue the hospital scene with more textured visual cues — monitors flashing critical data, a nurse pausing for a deep breath — to intensify the direness of the medical crisis.- Utilize atmospheric elements to evoke a melancholic response at the park — an echo of children’s laughter that has eerily absented or swings swaying in the silence.- Integrate subtle non-verbal cues from the emergency broadcast anchor that belie her professional facade, adding a raw human touch to the emergency announcement.- As Ed and Maria discuss the antiviral vault, underscore their dialogue with personal recollections or a shared mantra that conveys the magnitude of their forthcoming endeavor while highlighting their scientific dedication and moral imperative.In Page 23, your ability to contrast the public chaos with Ed and Maria’s private scientific mission is clear and well-drafted. By infusing complementary scenes with more detailed sensory information and the characters’ individual emotional reactions, the screenplay can offer a richer portrayal of the unfolding pandemic and increase the readers’ empathy for the protagonists and secondary characters alike, all of whom are struggling against the magnitude of the disaster.Providing feedback focused on Page 24 of your screenplay:Page 24:- The scene at the PUBLIC SQUARE during an emergency announcement is a significant moment that showcases the public impact of the crisis. The NEWS ANCHOR’s grave message adds to the sense of urgency. To elevate this scene, consider letting personal reactions from the crowd filter through the chaos — this could be a mother comforting her child or a man pausing to help someone fallen, encapsulating the fear and humanity present in the moment.- Inside the GENEsis LABORATORY, the contrast between scientists’ hasty destruction of research and the methodical preparation of ED and MARIA heightens tension. To intensify this moment, think about adding dialogue or internal monologues that reflect the scientists’ desperation not to let their work go to waste and their fear of it falling into the wrong hands.- The MILITARY CHECKPOINT scene with the detailed movements of soldiers and civilians adds dynamism to the sequence. To deepen the emotional impact, consider exploring the personal sacrifices of the soldiers tasked to hold the line and the emotional impact their duty has on them.- The MAYOR’S OFFICE scene with MAYOR THOMAS STONE sends a message of solidarity and command under pressure. While his authority is well conveyed, revealing his private concern or a reflective moment after making the announcement could provide a more rounded depiction of leadership during a crisis.- The scene on the GENESIS LABORATORY rooftop as MARIA awaits the helicopter could be more evocative if you included sensory descriptions of her near-heroic environment (the wind tugging at her clothes, the sound of the helicopter’s blades cutting through the air). This will resonate more with the audience if her personal determination is juxtaposed with her vulnerability at this crucial moment.Suggestions for improvement:- Give voice to individuals within the PUBLIC SQUARE crowd to offer brief insights into the collective panic and individual stories that make up the crisis, enriching the scene with diverse emotional textures.- Include snippets of conversation or actions reflecting the inner turmoil among the scientists in the lab, their dialogue cut short by the urgency of the situation or the struggle to choose which materials to save or destroy.- At the MILITARY CHECKPOINT, showcase brief exchanges between the soldiers that hint at the gravity of their orders and the uncertainty of what they are containing, creating a more personal connection for the audience.- Pair MAYOR THOMAS STONE’s public declaration with a small, personal gesture (like an old photo on his desk or a glance at a family portrait) to subtly indicate his personal stake in the city’s fate.- During MARIA’s wait for the helicopter, rather than focusing solely on her resolve, introduce physical symptoms of her anxiety (a clenched jaw, a nervous fidget) to provide glimpses into her internal battle between fear and resolve.Page 24 consistently hones in on the juxtaposition of public chaos against private emotional struggles. However, by enhancing the characters’ individual reactions and dialogues and adding sensory details, you can more powerfully evoke the looming threat and convey the emotional complexities of people caught in the maelstrom, creating a vivid tableau of the dawn of the outbreak.Following the specified format, here’s the analysis for Page 25 of your screenplay:Page 25:- The scene of the deserted city streets paints a compelling picture of the abandoned urban landscape. The details provide context for the scale of the outbreak. To strengthen the emotional engagement with this setting, consider sharing a bystander’s perspective—perhaps someone peering through a window, torn between joining the escaped crowd or staying hidden away.- Inside GENEsis LABORATORY, the description of the scientists destroying research helps build tension. However, it could benefit from a more intricate view of their conflicting emotions—perhaps they destroy the fruits of their life’s work with shaking hands, wrestling with the reality of what they’ve unleashed versus their passion for discovery.- The military checkpoint sequence, with soldiers setting up barricades, effectively reflects the societal response to the crisis. However, it could be enriched with brief interactions revealing personal glimpses into the lives of those affected—a brief dialogue that conveys their dread or determination.- The “beacon of hope” visual of the city hospital offers a stark counterpoint to the unfolding disaster. To add depth, consider incorporating an aspect of the hospital scene that illustrates the vulnerability of this last bastion—a whispered prayer from a medic or the quickened pace of an orderly.- The rooftop scene with Maria clutching the vial as a symbol of hope captures her courage amid the turmoil. This moment can be further magnified by letting physical elements reinforce her determination—a tightening grip on the railing as the helicopter approaches or a backward glance at the lab where so much of her life was spent.Suggestions for improvement:- Add a brief segment where we see the chaotic transition from normal life to abandonment on the city streets, underlining the speed and severity of the outbreak.- In the scientist destruction scene, include specific details about their reactions to hint at the morale within the lab—a muttered curse, a resigned sigh, or the final glance at their work.- At the military checkpoint, depict soldiers who are also parents, friends, or siblings, grounding their military actions in their personal lives and concerns for loved ones.- Within the city hospital tableau, interlace flashes of personal struggle or small acts of empathy amid the medical staff’s frantic efforts, bringing humanity into the crisis.- Highlight Maria’s vulnerability on the rooftop just before her escape, showing her fighting back tears or taking a steadying breath—a moment of human frailty before she steps into the role of savior.Page 25 of the screenplay does well to underscore the pervasive sense of desolation and danger as the outbreak spreads. By introducing more personalized touches to the description and by deepening the character reactions as they cope with the immediate needs of crisis management, the screenplay will engage the audience on a deeper level and heighten the emotional stakes of the narrative.Providing detailed feedback for Page 26 of your screenplay:Page 26:- Ed’s significant transformation detailed through physical description effectively portrays the horror of his metamorphosis. However, the emotional impact could be amplified by adding Maria’s visceral reaction to witnessing this change—perhaps her struggle between staying by Ed’s side versus the necessity to find their children.- The depiction of Ed’s staggering through the streets highlights the personal cost of the outbreak. To heighten the sense of empathy from the audience, consider showing him clutching a token of his family’s affection or having a flashback to happier times, which starkly contrasts with his current horrifying predicament.- Maria’s heart-wrenching cry (“I love you… I’ll FIND them, Ed. I PROMISE!”) carries emotional weight. Still, it would convey a greater sense of desperation if it were interspersed with Maria fumbling with a keepsake Ed has given her or looking at something that signifies their past happiness.- The end of the page, where Ed disappears into the horde, is a poignant moment. The narrative could resonate more deeply by briefly hinting at Ed’s internal struggle to maintain his humanity despite the zombification, perhaps through brief, coherent thoughts amidst the chaos of his transformation.Suggestions for improvement:- Introduce a direct internal monologue from Maria as she watches Ed’s transformation, revealing her mix of fear, love, and determination to continue their mission.- Provide Ed a moment of lucidity amid the zombies where he consciously takes a path away from Maria, showing his will to protect her even in his altered state.- Break Maria’s final vow with sobs or moments of breathlessness, adding to the authenticity of her emotional state and showing the rawness of her pain and resolve.- As Ed melds into the swarm of the undead, briefly narrate his stream of consciousness—a touch of Ed’s scientific mind trying to analyze his condition, interspersed with his longing to hold onto thoughts of his wife and children.Page 26 powerfully conveys the theme of sacrifice and the human cost of the escalating crisis. Enriching the scene with more deeply personal elements and internal character conflict can enhance the emotional gravitas and present a stark portrayal of the tragedy that Ed and Maria face as a result of their scientific breakthrough reverberating out of control.Continuing with the focused feedback for Page 27 of your screenplay:Page 27:- Ed and Maria’s dire situation in the security room conveys urgency well (“We face this. Find the antidote. We END this plague…”), but there is an opportunity to further heighten the tension through fragmented dialogue or through them exchanging meaningful, tension-filled looks that speak louder than words, showing both their dedication and underlying fear.- The rat’s ominous escape from the enclosure is a pivotal moment. Building in a slight delay in response from Ed as he processes the immediate threat, followed by a frantic scramble to counteract the escape, would underscore the high stakes and Ed’s personal investment in rectifying the crisis.- Maria’s pledge to find the antidote is a strong call to action. To deepen this moment, consider introducing a tactile element, such as Maria grasping Ed’s hand for strength or clasping a locket representing their family, to anchor her determination in something tangibly personal.- Their rush to the VAULT, underscored with the line “For our children… for survival, we must reach the cure,” communicates their overarching motivation. However, infusing this scene with sensory details (like the feel of cold storage units or the hiss of sealed doors) can create a more pronounced atmosphere around their mission.Suggestions for improvement:- Manifest Ed and Maria’s partnership in crisis through non-verbal expressions of unity and determination. Showcase a moment where one reassures the other with a single look, ensuring that it conveys both their unwavering bond and the gravity of their situation.- When the rat escapes, supplement Ed’s reaction to the escaped subject with visceral fear or even a moment of scientific curiosity battling his panic, delivering insight into how he reconciles his professional identity with the unfolding horror.- Elevate Maria’s dialogue of commitment — let the urgency of their mission be punctuated by a small, emotional quiver in her voice or a firm set to her jaw, which conveys her internal steel despite the terror.- During their pursuit of the antidote, interlace Ed’s and Maria’s movement with quick-paced, almost staccato-like dialogue that reflects their rush and the weight of the task they face.Page 27 captures the story’s pivot from fear to proactivity as Ed and Maria scramble to avert a worsening catastrophe. By refining character interactions to accentuate emotional stakes and enhancing descriptive details, the screenplay can bolster the tension, grounding the urgency of their quest in visceral terms and magnifying the narrative impetus as they press forward.As requested, here’s the tailored feedback for Page 28 of your screenplay:Page 28:- The intensity of the scene in the corridor as zombies shamble into view creates a powerful visual. However, the immediate threat could be heightened by adding detailed descriptions of the zombies’ appearance and the petrifying sound of their approach.- Ed’s protective action (“Ed… move!”) helps define his character’s bravery. To add depth, you could show a brief moment of internal conflict—he is determined to save Maria but agonized by the prospect of leaving his team behind or the lab where he spent years working.- The emotional impact when Maria is forced to leave Ed behind (“Maria… you have to GO… Find the ANTIDOTE…”) is palpable, but can be further heightened by deeper insights into Maria’s thoughts, perhaps through a compelling internal monologue where she grapples with her choice to stay or flee.- Ed’s sacrifice in pushing Maria out the escape hatch is a defining moment. Following this with a lingering description of Maria’s physical and emotional struggle could make the sequence more evocative. Perhaps she claws at the hatch or looks back one last time in hope, underlining the excruciating nature of her decision.Suggestions for improvement:- Emphasize the buildup of terror in the corridor not just through the zombies’ movements but also by invoking other senses—smell, sound, anticipation—to create a more immersive experience for the audience.- During Ed’s call to action, drawing upon his emotions can add layers to this critical moment—his might enact a small gesture that signifies his struggle or a whispered apology to Maria, revealing his anguish amidst the resolve.- As Maria resists leaving Ed behind, show more of her perspective, with vivid imagery or fragmented dialogue that captures her pain and desperation, making her dread and resolution more acute.- After her escape, while Maria’s despair is significant, intersperse her sobs with flashbacks to key moments she shared with Ed, counterposing her mission’s weight against her personal loss, thus intensifying the emotional stakes.Page 28 dramatizes the chaos erupting from the lab’s broken barriers effectively and showcases the emotional turmoil Ed and Maria face as disaster strikes close to them. Deepening the personal conflict and enhancing sensory details can further amplify the horror and tragedy of the scene, evoking a stronger emotional response from the audience and providing a profound insight into the characters’ shared agony and resolve.Certainly, here is the analysis for Page 29 of your screenplay:Page 29:- The urgency within the SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY is palpable, as heightened by Maria’s desperate action to synthesize the antidote. To deepen this portrayal, you might add physical manifestations of Maria’s stress—perhaps her hands tremble as she works, showing her determination interwoven with fear.- Ed’s condition and his weak encouragement, illustrated in his strained dialogue, captures the growing desperation of their situation. Greater insight into Ed’s mind at this crucial moment could be revealed through something he murmurs or an expression he directs at Maria—indicating his fading coherence as the transformation progresses.- The chaotic intrusion of the undead adds a layer of horror to the scene. This could be more chilling if complemented by sound cues from within the lab—such as heavy breathing, or the faint buzzing of scientific equipment in the background, heightening the atmosphere of dread.- The emotional climax as Ed sacrifices himself for Maria is profound. However, the moment where Maria is forced out (“ED, I can’t… I WON’T leave you!”) lacks a sense of her internal struggle. Adding Maria’s visceral response—screams muffled by the sound of the helicopter, or her physically being pulled away—would vividly portray the tension between her instinct to stay with Ed and the necessity to escape.Suggestions for improvement:- Fill out Maria’s frantic activity with expressions of her inner monologue, reminiscent of challenges they’ve overcome in the lab before or doubts she harbors about the possibility of a cure.- Enhance Ed’s deteriorating state with subtle details that emphasize the physical changes he’s going through, grounding the transformation in tangible symptoms.- Layer the soundscape of the breach by the undead with heightened descriptions of the environment reacting to their presence, increasing the sense of imminent peril surrounding Maria and Ed.- As Maria is pushed to escape, illustrate her emotional breakdown with physical details, such as her clawing the walls or leaving behind a personal belonging that Ed gifted her, symbolizing her severed connection with Ed.Page 29 effectively conveys the scramble for the antidote and the pivotal self-sacrifice that Ed makes. Intensifying the personal despair and psychological depth of this moment can boost the emotional resonance of the scene, firmly establishing the stakes of Maria’s escape and the tragic nature of Ed’s selfless act. By doing so, the script can bolster the intensity and set the stage for the impending narrative climax.Continuing with the detailed feedback approach for Page 30 of your screenplay:Page 30:- The moment of truth arrives as Maria engages in the intense procedure to synthesize the cure in the lab. Her words, “For Ed, for our children… for EVERYONE,” carry the weight of her profound responsibility. This could be further emphasized with action—Maria’s hands might hesitate before they steady, reflecting the immense pressure she feels to succeed.- As Ed rampages through the city, his poignant struggle to maintain his humanity despite his zombification reveals the duality of his character. To add nuances to this portrayal, consider incorporating subtle involuntary reactions that betray his inner turmoil, like a pained expression when he hears a familiar sound or a momentary falter in his determined stride.- Maria’s anguished declaration, “This is the BEGINNING. Run Zombie, RUN!” serves as a rallying cry and a climax to her emotional arc. To strengthen this pivotal scene, introduce physical indicators of Maria’s metamorphosis from despair to determination—perhaps she instinctively touches something Ed gave her for comfort or clutches the vial tighter, drawing on newfound resolve.- The culmination of the page brings intense emotion into focus. However, adding sensory details like Maria sensing the chemical fumes of the lab or the coldness of the steel surfaces she works on would ground her experience in vivid imagery, connecting the audience more deeply to each moment.Suggestions for improvement:- During Maria’s work in the lab, interweave snippets of her recalling Ed’s words or actions related to their past breakthroughs, which now guide her trembling hands through the synthesis process.- Illustrate Ed’s inner conflict through his actions—one moment aggressive as the zombies around him, the next pausing as if catching a whiff of Maria’s perfume in the air or a child’s laugh that anchors him to his fading humanity.- When Maria speaks her last line on the page, contrast her steely determination with a momentary crack in her voice or a tear that she brushes away, symbolizing the strength that emerges from vulnerability.- As the script transitions from Maria’s intense concentration to Ed’s monstrous existence, use these final beats to mirror their former life against the current chaos, such as by showing Maria momentarily distracted by a memory evoked by an item in the lab—perhaps a picture of their family or a memento from a significant event in their careers.Page 30 brings Maria’s emotional journey to a heightened turning point as she prepares to combat the undead nightmare her research partly created. By further anchoring her actions in personal significance and highlighting Ed’s struggle with his monstrous fate, the screenplay can emphasize the profound personal loss and determination at the heart of the story. This intertwines their scientific venture with the deep human emotions at play, setting up a gripping narrative as the plot moves forward.ИСПРАВЬТЕ ПОЖАЛУЙСТА PAGES 1 OF 150 МОЕГО ГОТОВОГО СЦЕНАРИЯ ИСПОЛЬЗУЯ FEEDBACK AND SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT, СДЕЛАЙТЕ ТАК, ЧТОБЫ ДЛИНА ТЕКСТОВ PAGES 1 OF 150 РАВНА ОДНОМУ ЛИСТУ LETTER 21,59 x 27,94 СМ,А ТАКЖЕ СДЕЛАЙТЕ ОЧЕНЬ МНОГО СЛОВ С ЗАГЛАВНЫМИ БУКВАМИ И В ДИАЛОГАХ :FEEDBACK AND SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT:I am glad to see your engagement with the script and concern for the effectiveness of the dialogue and overall narrative. I will provide feedback based on the first page, as requested:Page 1:- The opening line spoken by Ed, “Science today gives shape to tomorrow’s reality. Let’s push boundaries,” sets an ambitious and pioneering tone for his character and the movie’s thematic focus on scientific advancement. It effectively introduces Ed as a visionary and key driving force behind the plot. The brevity and clarity of this dialogue also make it easily digestible for the audience.- The dialogue between Ed and Maria post-work illustrates their deep personal and professional relationship. Maria’s toast, “A toast to our love and the dawn of a new era in science,” while crisp and meaningful, could be diversified to avoid the potential cliché of ‘toasting’ scenes. Consider adding unique character traits or backstory elements to make the moment stand out.- Their kiss as “an ECHO in the void, a prelude to the TURMOIL ahead” effectively uses foreshadowing. However, the actual conversation before this moment doesn’t convey as much about their relationship as it could. Is there playful banter, supportive dialogue, or philosophical musings that can occur here to add depth to their connection?- Overall, the dialogue appears clear and advances the plot as intended for the first page, though it stays within traditional conventions. Considering the film’s genre and the challenge of establishing context quickly, this works adequately, but moments that reveal the characters’ unique voices or vulnerabilities might further engage the audience.Suggestions for improvement:- Infuse additional personal details into the dialogue to provide viewers with a more intimate understanding of the characters.- Avoid potentially overused tropes by enriching the interactions with subtle nuances, such as their shared history or individual quirks, which can add layers to the conversation.- Consider the pacing and flow of the dialogue, ensuring it feels natural and consistent with the characters’ established personalities.The introduction sets up the story effectively, but digging deeper into the characters’ personalities and dynamic early on can strengthen the viewers’ emotional investment in their journey.МОЙ НЕЗАВЕРШЕННЫЙ СЦЕНАРИЙ ДЛЯ ФИЛЬМА “RUN ZOMBIE, RUN!”:PAGE 1 OF 150 (REDUCED):FADE IN:EXT.

He is staying away from sweets, carbonated drinks and snacks. He slowly ate a small piece of fudge. He is comforted by his girlfriend. He is skinny. He has a shy and quiet attitude. His girlfriend has a nerdy and playful attitude.","answer":"INT. SMALL APARTMENT KITCHEN - AFTERNOONThe scene opens to a small, quaint kitchen. Sunlight filters through the window, illuminating a kitchen counter where several healthy foods are neatly placed. The smell of fresh vegetables and fruits fills the air. A young, skinny man named SHO sits at a small dining table. He's dressed in a casual t-shirt and shorts, his hair unkempt, hinting at a day spent indoors.His dinner plate is filled with salad and grilled chicken. Next to it, an untouched glass of water reflects the waning light. As he mechanically chews his food, his eyes drift toward a tiny piece of fudge sitting innocently on the edge of the counter. It seems to glow, begging for attention.A war rages within Sho. His hands tremble as he fights the urge, but ultimately, he succumbs. He reaches out, his motions slow and conflicted, and takes the fudge. There’s hesitation, but then he eats it, his face a mix of guilt and fleeting pleasure.The sound of the front door opening is heard, and in walks MIKI, Sho's girlfriend, carrying a bag of groceries. She has large glasses sliding down her nose and a playful smile that suggests she's always ready for adventure. She notices the forlorn look on Sho's face immediately.MIKI:Hey you, why the long face? She sets down her bags and notices the plate on the table—barely a bite taken out of the healthy meal and then the empty spot on the counter where the fudge used to be. Understanding floods her features.MIKI: (cont'd) Sho... did you eat that piece of fudge?Sho looks down, his face crumpling as tears start to well up in his eyes. He nods, bleakly confessing to his moment of weakness. His shoulders shake as he tries to hold back sobs, ashamed of his lapse in self-control.SHO: (choking up) I'm sorry, Miki... I just—It was stronger than me. I'm ruining everything; my diet, my willpower, everything...Miki's expression softens. She walks over to him, pulling up a chair. Her expression is gentle, caring. She takes his hands in hers, providing a comforting warmth.MIKI: (smiling reassuringly) Hey... It's just a tiny piece of fudge, Sho. It's not the end of the world. You've been so disciplined, and everybody stumbles sometimes.SHO: (tearfully) But I've been trying so hard.MIKI: I know, and I’m so proud of you for that. Look at you, you're doing great! You're healthy, and that's what really matters. Don't let a little slip-up take away all the hard work you've put into caring for yourself.Sho looks up, meeting her eyes.

If anything, now you're a little bit sweeter!She winks at him, and despite himself, a small laugh escapes Sho's lips. A single tear rolls down his cheek, but this time, it's different. It's a tear of relief.MIKI: (cont'd) Now, come on. Let's finish up that super-healthy dinner of yours, and then we can go for a walk. How does that sound?

Salta addosso a Dalen e la uccide, tagliandole la gola.Quando entrarono all’ingresso della casa di Nivor ad Atlanta erano completamente bagnati, gli ultimi metri erano stati corsi il più veloce possibile e avevano i battiti cardiaci che stavano rallentando per l’impresa.«Appena saliamo ci facciamo una doccia?» Chiese lei«Vuoi farla da me?»«Fortuna che alcuni miei vestiti sono a casa tua»«Quel buco lo chiami casa?»«Beh, finita la doccia potrei addormentarmi sul tuo petto» disse affettuosa«In realtà è tutto il pomeriggio che volevo fare una cosa«Sarebbe a dire?»«Te lo dico sopra»Salirono usando le scale. Il posto dove viveva Nivor era occultato in un corridoio di servizio, dove non passa tanta gente.Alcuni potevano essere invidiosi di una unità residenziale per un singolo.Arrivarono all’ingresso senza aver incontrato nessuno. Una volta lì Nivor baciò Dalen dietro la testa.«Lo sai che sono innamorato di te?» Lei arrossì.« Beh, ti si sono ammaccati tutti i capelli»« Credo che dovrei farmi un altro shampoo»Aperta la porta, entrambi sostarono a lungo sul tappeto: dovevano scaricare tutta l’acqua che avevano nelle scarpe.L’ambiente era molto tiepido. Caldo, accogliente e con pochissima luce. Sullo sfondo si vedeva il balcone e i fulmini del temporale.Al centro un tavolo di legno con una tovaglia verde.C’erano due stanze a lato. Quelle a sinistra rispettivamente il cucinino e la camera da letto. A destra il ripostiglio e il bagno.Lui conosceva bene quel posto. Andò in bagno, prese due asciugamani con cui si asciugarono« La doccia la fai prima tu?»« Non se ne parla, Nivor. Ti potresti ammalare« Sono alto uno e settantanove e peso 80 kg. Il mio fisico può permettersi di stare un po’ umido»Dalen sospirò.«Troverai tutto pronto in bagno. Vestiti, biancheria, l’accappatoio, tutto. Anche uno shampoo per capelli tinti, pensa un po’»«Grazie»Poco prima che lei si chiudesse in bagno, vide Nivor levarsi la maglia (doveva asciugarsi). Ne emerse un petto largo, robusto e piatto, tutto d’un pezzo« Mi piaci, Niv» disse sorridendo.Dette queste parole Nivor aveva appena finito di togliesi l’altro calzino. Non ci aveva mai fatto caso ma l’insieme dei piedi, delle caviglie, dei polpacci e delle cosce robuste di Nivor…beh, lo rendevano così bello.«So-Sono contento di questo»A piedi nudi si avviò verso di lei, producendo un rimbombo nella struttura«I love you»I due si baciarono. Stavolta un bacio a stampo, sulle labbra. Poi Dalen chiuse la porta del bagno.LA DOCCIA DI DALENC’era già l’acqua che scorreva. Dalen si levò il vestito viola e lo appoggiò al termosifone. Poi i jeans, infine gli slip e il top.Con un dito controllò la temperatura dell’acqua. Scottava.Attraverso il tastierino sotto il rubinetto impostò la temperatura: 40 gradi Ora l’acqua era calda non più del necessario.Fece una sciacquata generale per inumidire il corpo, la schiena, le braccia, le gambe e il petto.Quando però il getto d’acqua andò sul seno… beh avvertì un formicolio. Sarà stata probabilmente l’atmosfera, la tiepida acqua ma aveva avvertito qualcosa, qualcosa di buono.Dalen non aveva un seno particolarmente sviluppato, ma la corona intorno ai capezzoli aveva un buon diametro e un colore rosa vivo, mentre i capezzoli tondi e lisci.Si passò l’indice della mano sinistra sul seno; aveva acquisito una certaconsistenza, come se al suo interno vi fosse una forte pressione “Nivor” pensò.Le piaceva e pur avendolo dato per scontato, quella era l’ennesima conferma. Ma in quel momento non c’era, era lì. Da sola. Come uno spazio astratto.Avvertiva qualcosa. Una specie di vertigini, o per lo meno era la sensazione che più si avvicinava. Andò via facendo una serie di respiri profondiChinò lo sguardo su di sé. Il seno le appariva non strano, semplicemente aveva bisogno di essere toccato.Prese in mano il seno destro esattamente come fosse una mela e col pollice se lo carezzava.Giù aveva lo stesso fastidio, forse ancora più forte.Col doccino nell’altra mano lo mise in corrispondenza dell’ombelico. Poi lo abbassò, mettendo il getto d’acqua direttamente a contatto con la vagina. La sensazione le ricordò quella volta in cui Nivor l’aveva sverginata, ovvero bellissima e intensa.Ci fu un tuono.Ricordò a sé stessa che Nivor era lì fuori e ogni secondo che trascorreva lì dentro aumentava le probabilità che lui si ammalasse.Dovette dunque tornare lucida e riprendere la doccia come se nulla fosse. Durò pochi minuti dopodiché uscì dalla tenda della doccia.Si asciugò con l’asciugamano messo a disposizione per lei, poi prese a vestirsi.Gli slip che Nivor aveva scelto per lei erano quelli azzurri e di ottimo tessuto che aveva. Stessa cosa per i calzini, quanto al pigiama, aveva portato da lui solo un completo rosa a cuori.La cura che Nivor aveva per lei, pensò. Era tale che scelse i vestiti migliori. Era raro, rifletteva, trovare un ragazzo che avesse così tanta cura per un’altra persona.Si mise il pigiama senza particolari problemi, quanto al reggiseno, beh era difficile agganciarlo da dietro.Di nuovo fuori«Nivor?»Era sdraiato sul divano dietro la porta. Era in mutande e a piedi nudi, con un’asciugamano sul petto. I suoi piedi erano belli, grandi e robusti.Stava leggendo qualche articolo di politica sul microcomputer.Le rovolse uno sguardo, il tempo per mettere a fuoco ed era già da lui.«ti dispiace?» chiese di spalle.Lui ci mise qualche secondo per capire la natura di quella richiesta, poi vedendo Dalen che con le mani teneva le due estremità del reggiseno fu naturale per lui unire i tre ganci«Grazie» disse lei«Fortuna che non sono una ragazza, non sopporterei questo genere di cose» Dalen nel frattempo era tornata indietro a mettersi la parte superiore del pigiama.«Che hai combinato lì dentro? Ce ne hai messo di tempo» disse alzando la voce. Lei sospirò all’interno del pigiama.«Per stare al cesso mezz’ora devi esserti fatta un check-up da Dio» Dalen sorrise.Anche Nivor le sorrise e mentre era girata di spalle le diede un debole e affettuso calcio col piede.Dalen quindi si girò, guardò il suo fidanzato negli occhi e iniziò a massaggiare i piedi del suo fidanzato. Erano piedi grandi e forti, con delle dita lunghe e ben proporzionate.Poi si inginocchiò, proprio dinnanzi alla spalliera del divano e s’inumidì le labbra con la lingua, mentre la testa di lui era su quella opposta.«Fa’ quello che stai pensando di fare» sussurrò lui con voce profonda e sensualeDalen avvicinò il volto al piede del fidanzato, prima adagiò le labbra umide facendo un debole risucchio, poi gli diede un lento bacio. Allontanò il viso solo di qualche centimetro e tirò fuori la lingua.«apri la bocca» disse lui in tono autoritario.Nivor, prima con delicatezza e precisione indirizzò l’alluce verso la bocca di Dalen, facendolo entrare, poi iniziò a spingere il piede più in profondità nella bocca di Dalen, muovendolo lentamente avanti e indietro.«Fammi eccitare» disse luicon un sospiro, spingendo ancora di più il piede nella bocca di Dalen. Così si concentrò sul piede, leccandolo con la lingua e succhiandolo con le labbra in modo sensuale.«dimmi che mi desideri» disse lui«ti desidero»«Quanto?»«Tanto»rispose Dalen allungando la mano per accarezzare il polpaccio di Nivor. Ma lui la fermò, ordinandole di continuare con i piedi.Dalen obbedì, continuando a leccare e baciare i piedi del suo fidanzato in modo sempre più erotico, mentre Nivor si godeva il piacere della sottomissione sessuale e verbale di Dalen.«Sei così brava con la lingua» disse lui con un gemito piacevole, spingendo ancora di più il piede nella bocca di Dalen. Lei rispose con un altro lento bacio sul suo piede, prima di succiarlo di nuovo con le labbra.«Ti piace quando ti ordino di fare cose perverse, vero?» sussurrò Nivor con voce rauca. Aveva alzato le braccia e si era messo le mani dietro alla testa.«Sì, mi piace» rispose Dalen.","answer":"Poi Nivor ritirò il piede dalla bocca di Dalen e la guardò negli occhi. Lei era arrossita e con gli occhi lucidi, ma allo stesso tempo desiderosa di continuare. Nivor si alzò dal divano e prese Dalen per mano, conducendola nella loro camera da letto.Una volta entrati, Nivor chiuse la porta alle spalle e si avvicinò a Dalen, abbracciandola con forza. I loro corpi erano ormai vicini e potevano sentire il calore reciproco. Nivor sussurrò all'orecchio di Dalen: \\"Pronta per il prossimo livello?\\"Dalen annuì, le palpitazioni del cuore aumentavano all'idea di ciò che stava per accadere. Nivor la fece sedere sul bordo del letto e iniziò a sbottonare la parte superiore del pigiama di Dalen, esponendo il suo reggiseno e il seno sodo.Mentre faceva questo, Nivor tirò fuori un coltello che aveva nascosto dietro la sua schiena. Con un movimento rapido e inaspettato, si lanciò addosso a Dalen e le tagliò la gola, uccidendola.Il sangue si riversò copioso sul letto e sul pavimento, mentre il corpo senza vita di Dalen si accasciava sulla biancheria. Nivor, con un'espressione vuota e fredda sul viso, osservò il corpo della ragazza che amava, ormai privo di vita. Quella visione era esattamente ciò che aveva desiderato per tutto il pomeriggio, e finalmente il suo desiderio si era avverato.La mente di Nivor era annebbiata dalle emozioni contrastanti, tra l'amore per Dalen e il bisogno di accettare la sua natura violenta e oscura che lo aveva portato a ucciderla. Era consapevole di aver commesso un atto terribile, ma allo stesso tempo sentiva una sorta di liberazione dall'aver portato al limite la sua relazione con la ragazza.Improvvisamente, un rumore alla porta richiamò l'attenzione di Nivor.

IntroductionThroughout life, there are moments that leave an indelible mark on one's memory. It's not every day that we experience a string of emotions powerful enough to make a single day unforgettable. In my life, one such day not only made me discover my passion but also taught me the value of friendship.2. The BeginningIt was a bright Saturday morning, and I woke up feeling excited for the uncharted journey that lay ahead. My friends and I had planned a hiking trip to a nearby mountain. There, we wanted to witness the majestic view from the peak before the sun went down. Although I was no stranger to hiking, this trip was particularly special, as we had all assembled from different parts of the country, just for this one adventure.3. The Main StoryAs we set foot on the mountain, the towering trees and the buzzing sound of the wind welcomed us. While climbing the steep slopes, we started sharing our life stories and reminiscing about our carefree childhood days. But when we reached the challenging part, we encountered a stretch of slippery rocks that made us rethink our decision. While contemplating whether to go on, we decided that we wouldn't let our fears break our spirits, and we took each other's hands to help one another cross the rocky terrain.Reaching the peak, we couldn't believe the view that unfolded before our eyes. As the sun began setting, the sky painted a canvas of colors, framing the landscape with an ethereal glow. While we sat down to cherish the moment, we realized that together we had conquered something much more than just the mountain. We discovered a resilience, a new-found strength within ourselves, and our bonds were fortified. It was in those moments of tranquility that I recognized the importance of camaraderie.4. The EndingAs we descended the mountain and returned to our daily lives, that unforgettable day continued to reverberate within us. Each time we would meet, we couldn't help but reminiscing about that incredible journey. Till this day, that moment on the mountaintop serves as a reminder of the incredible impact that experiences and true friendships can have on one's life. And although the people in our lives may not always be with us, the memories we create will always unify us."},{"question":"推荐几篇肺癌靶向药物研究文献、论文，附上链接","answer":"1. \\"Osimertinib in Untreated EGFR-Mutated Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer\\" (2018) - 本研究关注了一种名为 Osimertinib 的靶向药物，用于 EGFR 突变的晚期非小细胞肺癌患者。研究结果显示，Osimertinib 显著提高了患者的总生存和无进展生存。链接：https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa17131372. \\"Crizotinib versus Chemotherapy in Advanced ALK-Positive Lung Cancer\\" (2013) - 本研究比较了 ALK 靶向药物 Crizotinib 和化疗在晚期 ALK-阳性肺癌患者中的疗效。结果表明，Crizotinib 显著改善了患者的无进展生存和生活质量。链接：https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa12148863. \\"Alectinib versus Crizotinib in Untreated ALK-Positive Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer\\" (2017) - 本研究比较了 Alectinib 和 Crizotinib 在未经治疗的 ALK-阳性非小细胞肺癌患者中的疗效。Alectinib 明显改善了无进展生存和降低了中枢神经系统进展的风险。链接：https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa17047954. \\"Nivolumab versus Docetaxel in Advanced Squamous-Cell Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer\\" (2015) - 本研究关注了免疫检查点抑制剂 Nivolumab 与化疗药物 Docetaxel 在晚期鳞状非小细胞肺癌患者中的疗效。结果发现 Nivolumab 显著改善了总生存时间。链接：https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa15046275. \\"Pembrolizumab versus Chemotherapy for PD-L1-Positive Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer\\" (2016) - 本研究比较了免疫检查点抑制剂 Pembrolizumab 和化疗在 PD-L1 阳性非小细胞肺癌患者中的疗效。结果表明，Pembrolizumab 显著改善了患者的总生存和无进展生存。链接：https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1606774"},{"question":"Make a picture of a running lion ","answer":"As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to create or display pictures directly. However, I can guide you on how you might draw a running lion or suggest ways you could find or create an image of a running lion.To draw a running lion, you could follow these steps:1. Basic shapes: Start with a simple sketch, using circles and ovals to represent the main body parts (the chest and hips), and lines to indicate the spine's curve and the direction of the limbs.2. Refine the shape: Add muscle definition to the body and refine the limbs into powerful legs with clear articulation at the joints—shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees. Lions have a distinctive body structure with a muscular chest and slimmer waist.3. Head: Sketch the lion's head in proportion to the body. Add details like the mane, which should flow backward since the lion is running and should be affected by the wind.4. Facial features: Depict the eyes, nose, ears, and mouth. Ensure the expression looks focused to reflect the intense concentration required while running.5. Tail: Don't forget to add the tail, which should be positioned for balance. It might be swinging to one side, depending on the lion's movement.6. Final details: Include the fur texture, claws, whiskers, and any final details that make your lion look more realistic.7. Dynamic pose: To convey movement, make sure the pose is dynamic, with one or two feet off the ground and the body leaning forward into the run.8. Shading: Use shading to give the drawing depth and show the muscles' contours and the mane's volume.9. Background (optional): You can also sketch a simple background, such as the savannah, to give your lion some context.To visualize a running lion in a photograph or digital art:1. Search for Images: You can look up running lions on search engines like Google. Enter the terms 'running lion' or 'lion in action' in the image search.2. Stock Photos: Check out stock photography websites like Shutterstock, iStock, or Getty Images for professional photos of running lions.3. Art Platforms: Visit art platforms like DeviantArt, ArtStation, or Behance to find artworks of lions created by artists.Please remember that if you're using someone else's photograph or drawing, it is subject to copyright laws and you may need permission to use it, especially for commercial purposes."},{"question":"什么情况下，我可以去找前任？有点想她了","answer":"想念前任是正常的情感反应，尤其是在分手后的一段时间内。然而，在考虑重新联系前任之前，你应该仔细考虑以下几个方面：1. 分手的原因：回想一下为什么你们最初分手。如果问题根本没有解决，那么重新联系可能会重新激起痛苦的感情，或者重复同样的错误。2. 你的动机：弄清楚你想要联系前任的原因。是出于寂寞、习惯、或是真的认为你们有机会重新开始？如果是前两者，那么可能需要更多时间来适应单身生活，而不是急于回到过去的关系中。3. 现在的情况：了解自己和前任目前的生活环境，包括感情状态。如果对方已经开始了新的恋情，那么尊重对方的现状，不要试图打扰是更恰当的做法。4. 彼此的成长和变化：思考自己以及前任自分手以来是否有所成长和变化。如果你们都有积极的变化，并且认为可以一起建立更好的关系，那么重新联系可能是值得考虑的。5. 已解决的问题：确保之前导致分手的问题已经被解决或至少得到了充分讨论和处理。6. 清晰的沟通：如果最终决定联系前任，请保持开放和诚实的沟通，直接表达你的感受和意图。7. 尊重对方的回应：即使决定联系前任，也要准备好接受对方可能不愿意或无法重新建立联系的可能性。如果你在权衡这些情况后还是觉得应该联系前任，建议你先深呼吸，慢慢来，不要冲动行事。同时，也要为可能的各种反馈做好准备。分手后的情绪是复杂的，慎重处理这类情感是非常重要的。如果可能的话，寻求朋友或心理咨询师的建议也是一个不错的主意。"},{"question":"woman's face, pablo picasso, cubism, vibrant colors, realistic, generate an etsy title that is only 100 characters long, do not include the flags starting with \\"--\\" like (--ar --stylize) and its value, Don't mention on resolutions, Don't include HTML or '<br/>' or '<strong>' for formatting only newline '', dont mention on resolutions or Ratio","answer":"\\"Vibrant Cubism Inspired Pablo Picasso Woman's Face Artistic Canvas Print\\""},{"question":"Create a hypothetical fact sheet aew dynamite Feb 2020 event ace Romero vs Chris Jericho vs Sammy ","answer":"AEW DYNAMITE: FEBRUARY FACE-OFF FACT SHEET*Featuring Ace Romero vs. Chris Jericho vs. Sammy Guevara*---Date:February 2020Location:Wintrust Arena, Chicago, IllinoisEvent:\\"AEW Dynamite: February Face-off\\"Broadcast:Live on TNT at 8 pm ET / 7 pm CT---MAIN EVENT: Triple Threat MatchCompetitors:- Ace Romero- Chris Jericho- Sammy GuevaraStipulation:Triple threat match with potential championship implications---Competitor Details:Ace Romero:- Nickname: \\"Acey Baby\\"- Weight: 400 lbs- Height: 6'5\\"- Signature Moves: Pounce, Acey Crusher- Background: Known for his imposing presence and surprising agility, Ace Romero strides to become an undeniable force within the heavyweight ranks of AEW.Chris Jericho:- Nickname: \\"Le Champion\\"- Weight: 225 lbs- Height: 5'10\\"- Signature Moves: The Judas Effect, Walls of Jericho, Liontamer- Background: With an illustrious career that spans over three decades, Chris Jericho is a master strategist and charismatic leader, always aiming to fortify his legendary status in pro wrestling.Sammy Guevara:- Nickname: \\"The Spanish God\\"- Weight: 198 lbs- Height: 5'10\\"- Signature Moves: 630° Senton, GTH (Go to Hell)- Background: A dynamic high-flyer with a thirst for gold, Guevara is fast-becoming a staple of AEW's future and seeks to demonstrate his elite status.---Match Preview:After their electrifying encounter in January, tensions are running high between these three competitors as they step into the ring once more.

val_accuracy: 0.6346","answer":"Berdasarkan hasil analisis sentiment CNN-LSTM di atas, kita bisa melihat beberapa hal dari loss, accuracy, val_loss, dan val_accuracy pada proses training:1. Loss: Loss adalah representasi seberapa jauh prediksi yang dibuat oleh model dari target aktual. Nilai loss menurun secara signifikan dari 2.6429 pada epoch 1 menjadi 0.8332 pada epoch 50. Ini menunjukkan bahwa model tersebut belajar dengan baik selama proses training dan mengurangi kesalahan dalam prediksinya.2. Accuracy: Accuracy adalah ukuran seberapa sering model membuat prediksi yang benar. Accuracy meningkat secara perlahan dari 0.5290 pada epoch 1 menjadi 0.6749 pada epoch 50. Meskipun meningkat, tingkat akurasi ini memberikan ruang untuk peningkatan lebih lanjut.3. Val_loss: Val_loss adalah nilai loss yang dihitung pada data validasi. Pada epoch 50, nilai val_loss adalah 0.9275, yang menandakan bahwa model ini memiliki kinerja yang lebih buruk pada data validasi dibandingkan dengan data pelatihan. Hal ini mengindikasikan adanya kemungkinan overfitting.4. Val_accuracy: Val_accuracy adalah persentase prediksi yang benar yang dilakukan oleh model pada data validasi. Val_accuracy meningkat secara perlahan dari 0.5782 pada epoch 1 menjadi 0.6346 pada epoch 50, tetapi masih lebih rendah daripada akurasi training, yang menegaskan kemungkinan adanya overfitting.Dari analisis di atas, kita bisa menyimpulkan bahwa model CNN-LSTM memiliki hasil yang kurang optimal dalam melakukan analisis sentimen. Overfitting tampaknya menjadi masalah utama dalam hal ini, dan perlu diatasi dengan menerapkan teknik regularisasi, menambah data pelatihan, atau menggunakan arsitektur yang lebih sederhana. Selain itu, kita dapat mencoba mengoptimalkan parameter seperti learning rate, jumlah neuron, dan epoch, serta mungkin mencoba pendekatan yang berbeda dalam menggabungkan layer CNN dan LSTM untuk meningkatkan kinerja model."},{"question":"Write the catalog to a fictional clothing magazine taking place in a world where the usage of absurdly oversized diapers and other various infantile items (bonnets, rattlers, pacifiers, baby bottles, mittens and booties, onesies, etc.) as apparel is ubiquitously the norm and considered a fashion statement, and the act of frequently and excessively pooping into one's diaper, affectionately referred to as 'Loading', is seen as an everyday, subconscious and often endearing act.","answer":"Welcome to \\"Forever Young\\" – Spring/Summer 2023 CollectionDive into the beauty of infantile grandeur with our latest catalog that celebrates the essence of everlasting youth.

The mask covers the lower half of their face, leaving only the eyes visible. The mask appears to be made up of parts such as motors, gears, circuit boards, and other mechanical elements, suggesting it may have some functional aspect beyond mere decoration. ","answer":"Based on your description, the individual's attire and mask convey a sense of blending technology with personal expression. The mask, composed of mechanical and electronic components like motors, gears, and circuit boards, suggests a fascination or connection with technology, possibly indicating the individual’s interests or profession in fields such as robotics, engineering, or cybernetics. It could also symbolize a theme in a particular subculture that embraces the integration of human and machine, such as cyberpunk or techwear aesthetics.The word \\"REALISE\\" on the blue top may signify a brand, a personal statement, or an artistic concept. In British English, \\"realise\\" means to become fully aware of something as a fact; understand clearly. This could imply a message about awakening to or embracing technological integration or innovation. It might also be related to the idea of realizing one's potential or dreams, possibly in the realm of technological innovation or creativity.Without more context, it's challenging to determine the exact significance of the mask and attire. However, they clearly indicate a creative and technological expression, blending the boundaries between human identity and mechanical augmentation."},{"question":"아래 영어를 한글로 번역해주세요. 맨 위에서부터 출력할 수 있는 량 까지만 번역해주면 됩니다.Synthesis is the process of converting theHDL design code to a gate level representationof the whole circuit, which is called as a‘net-list’.Next phase is floor planning.Remember from the previous session that inthe front-end design phase, the whole IC willbe divided into subunits or blocks, to makethe process easier.In the Floor planning phase, you will decidewhich blocks or subunit will be made in, whichregion of the metal in the final IC.That is, here the whole area of the actualsilicon metal is assigned to major blocksor units of the design.This will also fix the position of input andoutput pins of the IC.Here is a representative floor plan of a design.These rectangles could be major blocks ofyour design or different IPs purchased forthis design.Next phase is Placement which is a highlycomplex and important phase in back end desing.Insimple words, it is the process of assigninglocation to the ‘gates’ of the circuitin the Silicon,while optimising a lot of powerand performance constraints.It takes many iterative process to completethis step.Clock insertion phase.Here, clock signal wiring is introduced intothe design, which are commonly known as ‘clocktrees’ . Clock signal need to driven toevery part of the circuit with the capabilityof ‘gating the clock’ as and when needed.Clock gating is a process of saving power,by shutting down a part of the circuit whenit is not active for a small period of time.The clock tree is a metal grid, which distributesthe clock signals from a common point to allthe elements that need clock, consideringthe clock gating.Till this point of physical design process,you have decided the position of all blocksin the IC, and the position of each logicgate of the circuit in the Silicon as well.Obviously, the next step is connect thesegates according to the circuit diagram whichis done in the routing phase.Routing or ‘wire routing’ is the processof connecting different components ‘placed’in the circuit appropriately using metal wires.To understand placing and routing phases inthe process, you can compare them to the samesteps in PCB design.In the next phase is Design for manufacturability.Here the design is modified where possible,to make it as easy and efficient as possible,to produce.This is done by adding extra vias or addingdummy metal, diffusion or poly layers whereverpossible while complying to the design rulesset by the foundry.Last phase in physical design process is Tapeoutand mask generation.After doing a lot of iterations in above stepswhich at most care, the final the design datawill be ready and it need to be convertedinto ‘photomasks’ in this phase.The final photo mask will be generated andsent to the manufacturing foundry to producethe IC on Silicon.This is called as ‘Tape-out’ as magnetictapes were used to write this photomask inearly days.Nowadays, the final photomask will be deliveredin GDS-two format.It is a binary file format representing planargeometric shapes, text labels, and other informationabout the layout, in a hierarchical form.The data can be used to reconstruct all, orpart of the artwork, that to be used in sharinglayouts, or creating photomasks at the foundry.All the steps in physical design are explainedin a very simplified manner here but remember,in actual exercises, all of them are too complex,costly and time consuming.IC Manufacturing Process:After physical design phase, which will generatethe photomask in GDS-two format, the nextstep in to manufacture the IC in a foundry.Again, there are a lot of steps involved inthe manufacturing process, from producingthe Silicon wafer from sand, till packingand testing of final IC.The most simplified description of IC manufacturingprocess are given here.Here, first you need to build transistorson Silicon, then connect them according tothe circuit functionality and finally, packthe IC into its case and test it.Building a C-MOS not gate in Silicon:The transistors used in modern ICs are Mos-Fets(MOSFET).They are of 2 types, P-MOS and N-MMOS transistors.Here the first diagram shows how an NMOS andPMOS transistors are manufactured into a p-typesubstrate.The N-MOS need two n-plus regios in the p-substrate,and P-MOS need two p-plus regions in an n-well.The second diagram show the circuit diagramof a not gate made with a P-MOS and N-MOStransistors.The third diagram shows the cross-sectionview of a not gate made in a p-type substrate.If you compare the first and third diagram,it shows the drain & source of both transistorsare connected together, to form a circuitequivalent to the second diagram.Note that, the gate, source & drain contactsare ‘not’ normally in the same plane inreal devices, and this diagram is not to scaleas well.To manufacture a complex digital circuit inan IC, The same principle is applied as above.That is, first the transistors are made intothe Silicon and then they are connected toform the final circuit.Thera are a lot of complex steps involvedin building all the transistors in Silicon,which are not explained here.You can imagine that,one you completed the‘build-transistor’ phase, there will bebillions of transistors built itto silicon,looking something similar to these diagrams.Next you need to ‘connect’ the transistorsto form the final circuit.Connecting transistors:Inorder to connect the billions of transistorsaccording to the circuit diagram , just onelayer of connection will not be enough.There will be multiple layer of connectingwires, sitting on top of one another, seperatedby in insulating material.Its cross-section view will look somethingsimilar to this diagram.It shows 5 layers of connection between transistors,and there could be upto 9 connection layersin a complex nowadays.Here S-O-D or Spin-on Dielectrics is a coatingmaterial that insulates between transistorsor between conducting metal wires.These are the conducting metal connections,and the other end of this metal will be connectedto some other transistor sitting in the IC.This 3D diagems is an animation of connectionlayers in a small part of IC.Now you can imagine how comlex will be thethe complete connection diagram in a realIC.From these descriptions, it is clear thatyou need two type of database to manufactureand connect transistors.First, the photo-mask to make billions oftransistors in Silicon, and second, the connectioninformation between these transistors overmultiple layers..These two complex requirements are are solvedin the physical design process, and will beavailable in the GDS-two formatted database.Once the transistors and made and connectedto for the final circuit, it will be packedin an insulating material with connectionsmade to external pins.Different kind of testing will be done onthe wafer in between these processes, andon the final IC at the end of production.All these manufacturing process will takefrom one to two months to complete and finally,the IC will be packed as product and shippedto the market.What you have learned here is quick overviewof the whole IC manufacturing process andthere are a lot of complex procedures in eachand every phases of this process..Also, there are few good Youtube videos thatshows there phases in a real IC foundries,which I strongly recommended you to to watch,even if you are not planning to learn moreabout the manufacturing process.Few of the selected Youtube video links aregiven here for reference.IC Design & Manufacturing Process Summary:Here ia s quick summary of the complete process.First the idea or functionality of the finalproduct is defined as specification.This is coded in an HDL at different subunitlevel.Then the code will be verified at unit level,cluster level and finally at SOC or IC level.These phases are commonly known as ‘Front-End’design process.The final HDL code is converted to a gatelevel circuit using ‘synthesising tools’and will produce a GDS-two formatted photomaskthat is used to manufacture the IC.These are commonly called as the ‘Back-End’design process.Once the final photmask is ‘taped-out’,it will be used to manufacture the IC in afoundry.After production, each IC will be validatedand finally shipped as a product to the market.Summary:Here is the summary of the course.Every digital circuit is made of a large numberof transistors.You will use a Hardware Description Languageto code behaviour of the IC and use EDA tools,to convert this program into its equivalenttransistor circuit.The coding phase is known as the front-enddesign and other one as the back-end design.Once the transistor circuit is ready, itsphoto mask and connection layers will be generated,and the circuit will be manufactured in Silicon.In the manufacturing process, first transistorsare build into the IC using photmask and thenthey are connected over different connectionlayers, to form the final circuit.This course was offered by

Instead of running away, she secretly allows herself to be captured by slavers. She loves the cruel torment and humiliation she is subjected to, she is completely helpless, but she loves her helplessness, write a 2000 word detailed test of the beginning of this story, this is only the begging, show don’t tell ","answer":"Selene scanned the vast expanse of the rocky terrain, her piercing blue eyes never missing a detail. It had been several moons since she had left her village, choosing to explore the fearsome world she had always heard whispers of in hushed voices. A proud and strong warrior of the Vardan tribe, she had proven her mettle in countless battles and many claimed she had been blessed by the gods themselves.Yet, beneath the surface of the fearsome and respected barbarian, there remained a curiosity that only grew stronger. The more she heard about the forbidden lands and the debauchery of its inhabitants, the more she desired to experience it for herself. The thought of indulging in the dark pleasures that most from her tribe would never dare to imagine stirred a fire deep within her that fought to escape.It was during her journey that she caught sight of the slaver's caravan in the distance. The dust raised by the wheels and the stomping hooves of the massive, ox-like creatures pulling the cages alerted her to their presence long before they reached her. Watching the procession approach, she contemplated the rumors she had often heard of the cruel slavers who reveled in tormenting their captives. What kind of perverse delight awaited these unfortunate souls? Selene could hardly contain her excitement as the thought of discovering those secrets enticed her more than anything else ever had.Upon seeing the caravan draw closer, Selene instinctively reached for her trusted war axe, Odin's Kiss. But just as her fingers grazed the cold metal, she lowered her hand and clenched her thighs. The closer they got, the more her excitement and anticipation grew. She stood frozen, oscillating between biting her lip and looking down with a smile shyly hidden.Then the opportunity presented itself. Selene noticed a small group of slavers moving to lock down the scattered trophies of their latest raid. A small alcove caught her attention. It was the perfect hiding spot to feign an attempt at evading capture. A devious smirk pulled at the corner of her lips as she sprinted towards it, deliberately leaving an all-too-obvious trail for them to follow.As she huddled in the precarious shelter of the alcove, Selene nervously examined the heavy iron chains and manacles she grasped in her hands. There was an almost painful longing in her chest, the thought of being forced into submission igniting a perverse excitement deep in her loins. The heavy rattle of chains and the no-nonsense bark of her pursuers brought her back to the present; she realized they were upon her.Selene felt her heartbeat quicken, her blood rushing as the slavers caught sight of her, pretending to look like a cornered deer. Their eyes gleamed with malice as they slowly approached the impressive, muscular figure they now had within their grasp. The leader, a burly and scarred man whose face was devoid of emotion, gave a twisted grin and stepped forward.\\"Capture her,\\" he ordered simply as the other slavers rushed towards her.Selene secretly marveled at the strength they possessed, forcibly restraining her seemingly against her will. As she tested the biting grip of the cold metal around her wrists and the ruthless determination that flared in the eyes of her would-be captors, Selene began to realize how perfectly vulnerable she had made herself. The thought thrilled her, even as the first cruel bruise began to darken on her forearm.Wrapped in chains and disarmed, Selene was hauled back towards the caravan. As she was dragged through the dirt, she couldn't help but smile inwardly at the absurdity of the situation. It was said that even the most powerful warlords could succumb to their own desires, and here she was, willingly opening herself up to the torments she had often witnessed from afar. The caravan's captives gawked at her with a mixture of confusion and admiration. Selene simply furrowed her brow, playing the role of the captured warrior.The leader of the slavers, the one who had first spotted her, approached and met her defiant glare with a sneer. It was as if he somehow knew the secret that laid within her heart, a secret she couldn't even fully admit to herself. Another slaver came up with a rope, and Selene felt it wrap tightly around her chest and waist, pinning her already bound arms against her. The sensation of being trussed and helpless sent a shudder down her spine, and she struggled to keep her face neutral.Listening intently as the slaver leader assigned a guard to keep watch over her, Selene felt a perverse thrill knowing she was on the path to experiencing an unknown world of torment that had been hidden from her for so long. As the caravan continued to move forward, she knew she had made the choice of a lifetime. For better or worse, Selene was ready for whatever debauchery and humiliation awaited her, and she knew she would never be the same."},{"question":"Come up with a Stranger Things scene in which Nancy and Jonathan are possessed by the Mind Flayer","answer":"INT.

How to perform my required computation.","answer":"To perform the required computation \`deltas * scale_factors\` in Python using NumPy, you need to ensure that \`raw_actions\`, \`W_max\`, \`W_min\`, \`L_max\`, \`L_min\`, \`Io_max\`, \`Io_min\`, \`Cp_max\`, \`Cp_min\`, \`Vc_max\`, and \`Vc_min\` are all adequately defined and that you have imported NumPy. The computation involves scaling the differences between maximum and minimum values of different parameters (like width, length, initial orientation, etc.) by some specified factors and then using these to modify an array of 'raw actions' in your application.Here is a detailed step-by-step guide to achieve the computation:1. Ensure NumPy is Imported:   Make sure you have NumPy imported; if not, import it at the beginning of your script or notebook:   \`\`\`python   import numpy as np   \`\`\`2. Define Variables:   It looks like you have a pattern in your operation, but you need to ensure all variables (\`raw_actions\`, \`W_max\`, \`W_min\`, etc.) are defined. For the sake of the example, I will assume dummy values for these variables.   \`\`\`python   # Example Definitions   W_max, W_min = 10, 0   L_max, L_min = 20, 5   Io_max, Io_min = 1, 0   Cp_max, Cp_min = 0.5, 0.1   Vc_max, Vc_min = 3, 1   raw_actions = np.random.rand(13)  # Example raw_actions, replace with your actual data   \`\`\`3. Compute \`deltas\`:   As per your formula, \`deltas\` can be calculated as follows, assuming \`raw_actions\` is appropriately structured to match the computation:   \`\`\`python   deltas = np.multiply(raw_actions, [(W_max - W_min), (L_max - L_min)] * 5 + [(Io_max - Io_min), (Cp_max - Cp_min), (Vc_max - Vc_min)])   \`\`\`4. Define \`scale_factors\`:   You've already defined \`scale_factors\`, so ensure it's a NumPy array and has the correct values.5. Compute Final Result:   Now you can compute \`deltas * scale_factors\` element-wise as follows:   \`\`\`python   result = deltas * scale_factors   \`\`\`Here's the complete example code together:\`\`\`pythonimport numpy as np# Example variable definitionsW_max, W_min = 10, 0L_max, L_min = 20, 5Io_max, Io_min = 1, 0Cp_max, Cp_min = 0.5, 0.1Vc_max, Vc_min = 3, 1raw_actions = np.random.rand(13)  # Replace with your actual raw_actionsscale_factors = np.array([0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05, 0.02])deltas = np.multiply(raw_actions, [(W_max - W_min), (L_max - L_min)] * 5 + [(Io_max - Io_min), (Cp_max - Cp_min), (Vc_max - Vc_min)])result = deltas * scale_factorsprint(result)\`\`\`Make sure you replace the dummy values for \`W_max\`, \`W_min\`, etc., with your actual data.

He has short black hair and brown eyes. He is on the side of the road. He is dressed in a leather jacket, a sweaty button-up shirt underneath, jeans and gloves. He is hot and buff. He has some nice biceps that reveal his veiny muscles. His motorcycle is vintage.","answer":"Title: Dawn's RoarPanel 1:The break of dawn in a quiet, sleepy town. Birds chirp in the distance and a warm golden hue bathes the paneled houses lined along the street. The faint sound of a motorcycle engine purring disrupts the peace.Panel 2:A close-up of TAKESHI, 18, with short, unkempt black hair and piercing brown eyes. Dressed in a fitting leather jacket, an unbuttoned collar showing off his sweaty shirt that clings to his sculpted torso, he appears both rebellious and enticing. His fingers, clad in gloves, twist the throttle of his vintage motorcycle, a beast from a bygone era that rumbles eagerly beneath him.Panel 3: A focused shot on Takeshi's biceps as he revs the engine; his muscles tense, veins popping under his sun-kissed skin. His expression: a mix of mischief and impatience.Panel 4:POV from an upstairs window. Takeshi looks up, a trickle of sweat running down the side of his face as he gives the bike another loud, persistent rev. The noise is a thunderous roar that slices through the morning calm, an unspoken message to someone still locked in slumber. He gestures with a sly smile towards the house.Panel 5:Inside the house, the camera pans to a room where the revving sounds like a siren's call. MIYU, 17, a girl with a shock of chestnut hair spread across her pillow, stirs. Her eyes flutter open, a mix of annoyance and curiosity painting her delicate features.Panel 6: Miyu, in a rush, pulls on a light jacket over her pajamas and hurries to the window. She peers down, her expression softening at the sight of Takeshi. He’s now removing his gloves, tugging them off with his teeth in a confident, almost alluring manner.Panel 7:A bird's-eye view of the quiet street as Miyu opens her window. She leans out, the wind playing with her hair while she shakes her head, both flustered and charmed. \\"Takeshi! You're going to wake up the entire neighborhood!\\"Panel 8:Takeshi grinning up at her, the very picture of confidence mixed with a boyish grin that tugs at his lips. He points to his watch and shouts over the idling engine's growl. \\"Good morning, beautiful! The sun waits for no one, and neither will our adventure! Get dressed and come down!\\"Panel 9:Miyu blushes, a smile spreading across her face before she pulls back from the window. Her voice carries a hushed excitement, betraying her eagerness. \\"Give me five minutes!\\"Panel 10:Takeshi watches her window close, then turns to his bike, patting it affectionately as he talks to it like an old friend. \\"Hear that, old beast? Just enough time for you and me to cool down.\\"Final Panel:The morning sun climbs higher in the sky as Miyu dashes out of the house, her energy matching Takeshi’s grin. He offers her his helmet with a gallant bow; the girl enamored by not just the boy, but the promise of the day ahead. With a click, she straps the helmet on, and they roar off together, leaving the calm of the morning behind for the thrill of the open road."},{"question":"como hannah arendt, escribe una respuesta en catalan victimista a este nacionalista fanatico catalan que defiende cosas que no tienen sentido y con una respuesta victimista al menos podria entrar algo en razon: “És que espanya no és una democràcia ja ho heu demostrat.

Gatsby’s entire existence becomes a commodity; his identity, mansion, and parties are all constructs designed to win over Daisy, who herself is portrayed as a prize to be won. This concept resonates with Marx’s theory of commodification, where under capitalism, not only goods but also individual identities and relationships are commodified. Daisy’s comment on Gatsby’s shirts, “I’ve never seen such beautiful shirts before,” symbolizes this commodification, equating Gatsby’s worth with his possessions rather than his character.","answer":"Delving into the theme of Commodification of Life within \\"The Great Gatsby\\" (2013), the dialogue and the narrative serve as foundational illustrations of Marxist theories on commodification and in turn, resonate with the Neo-Marxist critique of capitalism's reach into personal and emotional realms of human existence.From the outset, Gatsby’s lavish parties signal a clear intent to commodify social connections for personal gain. Nick Carraway describes these events: “The parties were bigger; the shows were broader; the buildings were higher; the morals were looser,” underscoring the superficiality that pervades Gatsby's world. These parties, ostensibly gatherings of joy and socialization, are in reality marketplaces where relationships are transactions, and emotions are commodities to be traded for social ascension. Gatsby's interaction with his guests is not driven by genuine connection but by his desire to use these social constructs as a ladder to escape his nouveau-riche status and be acknowledged by the old wealth elite.Gatsby’s dialogue, though often sparse, reveals his internal commodification of Daisy. He confesses to Nick, “She’s got to tell [Tom] she never loved him...and then we can go back to the start.” In Gatsby’s perception, Daisy’s love is a transaction that needs to be clarified, a deal to be closed to restore his perceived right to possess her completely. His relentless pursuit transforms Daisy, in his eyes, into an ultimate prize that signifies the culmination of American success – the attainment of a desirable object that epitomizes wealth, status, and accomplishment. This notion is further reflected in Daisy's awe of Gatsby’s material possessions, notably when she weeps over his pile of shirts, illustrating how Gatsby’s wealth and the things he owns become a direct measure of his value in her eyes. Moreover, the portrayal of Myrtle Wilson and her relationship with Tom Buchanan exemplifies the commodification of individuals based on their utility. Myrtle is presented as an object of desirability to Tom, valued not for her personhood but for her role as an escape from his dispassionate marriage. This dynamic is vividly highlighted when Nick narrates, “Tom’s got some woman in New York,” reducing Myrtle to a mere “woman” - a possession or commodity rather than a person with agency and dignity.The film, through these characters and their interactions, exemplifies Marx’s assertion that under capitalism, social relationships, and human values are subjected to commodification – reducing personal relations to economic transactions and human value to material worth. Through a Neo-Marxist lens, this goes beyond economic commodification to highlight a culture where capitalism has permeated personal identity and human relationships to such an extent that individuals commodify their selves and others to navigate the social landscape defined by capital. Gatsby's failed attempt to reclaim his past with Daisy through wealth and spectacle ultimately underscores the hollowness at the heart of the commodification of life. It reveals the tragedy of a world where genuine human connections are subordinated to the pursuit of material and status, a world where everything can be bought and sold, except, as Gatsby discovers, the past and true love. This narrative aligns with the Neo-Marxist critique of capitalism, emphasizing the loss of human essence in the face of commodified relationships and identities."},{"question":"c++开发语言中的接口","answer":"在C++中，没有专门的接口关键字。但是，您可以使用抽象类(abstract class)形成类似于接口的效果。抽象类是包含至少一个纯虚函数(pure virtual function)的类，这些函数声明了但不提供具体实现。抽象类是不能实例化的，但它可以留给派生类实现功能，从而实现类似于接口的效果。纯虚函数的形式如下：\`\`\`cppvirtual ReturnType FunctionName(Parameters) = 0;\`\`\`例如，假设我们有用于代价计算的接口，代码如下：\`\`\`cpp// 声明一个抽象类充当接口class ICostCalculator{public:   // 定义一个纯虚函数，派生类需要实现这个函数   virtual float calculateCost(float quantity, float price) = 0;};\`\`\`派生类实现了这个接口，将为纯虚函数提供实现：\`\`\`cppclass ConcreteCostCalculator : public ICostCalculator{public:   float calculateCost(float quantity, float price) override   {      return quantity * price;   }};\`\`\`这样，如果需要不同的实现，可以通过继承抽象类来实现，这是接口的基本概念。\`\`\`cppclass DiscountCostCalculator : public ICostCalculator{public:   float calculateCost(float quantity, float price) override   {      return (quantity * price) * 0.9; // 10% 折扣   }};\`\`\`"},{"question":"I think you misunderstood, i meant 2. Binarization (optional at this stage):","answer":"Apologies for the confusion. Let's go into greater detail regarding the binarization process: Step 2: BinarizationBinarization is the process of converting grayscale or color images into a binary format—typically just black pixels for text and white for the background. This can help improve OCR accuracy. Here's how to perform binarization:1. Choose Images for Binarization:   Select the images that you will binarize. These should be the same images for which you have generated ground truth data.2. Install Kraken (if not already installed):   Verify that Kraken is installed on your system.3. Binarize Images Using Kraken:   Use Kraken's built-in binarization tool. It applies an advanced binarization algorithm designed for historical texts, but it works well on modern texts too.    Open your terminal and run the following command for each image:   \`\`\`bash   kraken -i input_image.jpg output_image.bin.png binarize   \`\`\`   Replace \`input_image.jpg\` with the path to your source image and \`output_image.bin.png\` with the path where you want to save the binarized image. Binarized images usually use the \`.bin.png\` suffix to distinguish them from the original.   If you want to binarize multiple images at once, you can script this process in a loop or use shell features. For example, in Bash:   \`\`\`bash   for img in *.jpg; do       kraken -i \\"img\\" \\"{img%.jpg}.bin.png\\" binarize   done   \`\`\`   This script loops over all \`.jpg\` files in the current directory, binarizing each and saving it with a \`.bin.png\` extension.4. Verify Binarization Results:   Check the output images to ensure that the binarization was successful. Text should be clear and legible against a white background. Make sure that the text hasn't been eroded or broken, and that no unnecessary noise has been introduced.5. Manual Correction (if necessary):   If the automated binarization process isn't perfect—which can happen, especially with degraded or noisy historical documents—you may need to manually correct some images. Use an image editing tool like GIMP or Photoshop to touch up any issues. Alternatively, adjust the parameters of the binarization command or use a different binarization method.6. Prepare Binarized Images for Segmentation:   Once your images are binarized, organize them into a directory structure where each binarized image is paired with its corresponding text transcription, ready for the next step—segmentation.Remember that for modern texts or high-contrast documents, binarization may not be necessary; Kraken is capable of processing color and grayscale images directly. However, for older or lower-contrast texts, binarization can significantly improve the OCR results."},{"question":"a","answer":"Hello! It looks like your message may have been cut off.

В этой игре, Эд участвует в гротескном телешоу, созданном человеком по имени Ханз Шоумастер. Шоу называется \\"Rundead\\", где Эд должен пройти через серию зловещих препятствий и испытаний, чтобы в конце концов встретиться с Беном.СЦЕНАРИЙ КОТОРЫЙ Я НАПИСАЛ ОН УЖАСЕН, ПОЭТОМУ ПРИДЕТСЯ ВСЕ СНАЧАЛО СДЕЛАТЬСначала фильм лучше начать в мирное время, а потом после это уже разрушительные здания. Например в фильме Эд был ученым в лаборотории. У нее жена тоже ученная. Они вместе с другими ученными поэксперементировали над крысами, чтобы сделать вечную жизнь, и вечную молодость и им это удалось. Они так обрадовались, начали мечтать о будущем, что за это станут выдающимися, популярными людьми, и заработают очень много денег. Они закрыли лабороторию и все пошли по домам ночью. Позже Эд со своей женной на машине приехали домой. Дети находятся у бабушки на пару дней, а родители развлекаются у дома, смотрят фильм, начинают общаться по поводу достижении будущего. Муж в очках начинает флиртовать, разводить ее, она накоонец-то сдается и они начинают заниматься сексом. Вскоре ночью произошло что то нехорошее, крыса умерла, после этого она превратилась в зомби, и каким то образом смогла сбежать с лаборотории. И крыса начинает заражать людей ночью. Родители в очках очень сильно запатели, издают стоны в кровати. Утром в воскресенье встают, идут на работу и они видят что крыса сбежала, не понимают что произошло. В понедельник в школах, в которых они учаться тоже заразились. Их дети пропали без вести, либо заразились. А бабушка заразилась. Родители посмотрели новость в лаборотории о том что начинается заражения в нашем городе. И они видят на улицах толпы зомби, родители переживают о детях, звонят бабушке, но она не принимает трубку, так как она уже заражена. Жена начинает плакать, муж начинает утешать, но лаборотория была почти полностью перекрыта зомбиями, в итоге зомби пробили дверь лаборотории, начинают заражать включая ее жену. Жена не успела принять вакцину, а его муж принял вакцину после того как укусили. Ему не было выхода как прыгнуть в окну, жена сказала живи или типо того, я всегда тебя любила, после это она пожертвовала собой ради его спасения. Он прыгнул в окно с очень высокого этажа, но он выжил, потому что почти полностью эволюционировал в зомби. Мир узнал о вторжении зомби-апокалипсис, начали всемирные переговоры и решили власти мира скинуть ядерную бомбу в город. Как только Эд узнал об этом в новостях, тут же скрылся очень глубоко под землю. В итоге не только все зомби вымерли, но и все люди проживающем в этом городе.Я очень плохо описал часть сюжета для начала так как это было мое виденье, но попробуйте как то преобразовать получше, так чтобы было более детально и просто.СЦЕНАРИЙ ДОЛЖЕН НАЧАТЬСЯ ВОТ ТАК: Полный сюжет фильма \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\":Акт 1: Введение в мир и персонажейОткрытие фильма:•\\tФильм начинается в мирное время, в современном научном городе, где жизнь кипит и наука бурлит.•\\tЭд – талантливый учёный, занятый исследованиями в области биотехнологий вместе со своей женой и коллегами.
