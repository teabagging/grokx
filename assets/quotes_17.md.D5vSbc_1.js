Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.Return the intersection of these two interval lists.A closed interval `[a, b]` (with `a &lt; b`) denotes the set of real numbers `x` with `a &lt;= x &lt;= b`.The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` is `[2, 3]`.In addition to the above, you are also required to return the total length of the intersection intervals.Example 1:Input: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]], Total Length: 11Example 2:Input: firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]], secondList = []Output: [], Total Length: 0Example 3:Input: firstList = [], secondList = [[4,8],[10,12]]Output: [], Total Length: 0Example 4:Input: firstList = [[1,7]], secondList = [[3,10]]Output: [[3,7]], Total Length: 4Constraints:`0 &lt;= firstList.length, secondList.length &lt;= 1000``firstList.length + secondList.length &gt;= 1``0 &lt;= starti &lt; endi &lt;= 109``endi &lt; starti+1``0 &lt;= startj &lt; endj &lt;= 109 ``endj &lt; startj+1`","answer":"You can solve this problem by two-pointer technique, where you will be using two pointers to iterate over both the lists simultaneously. Here are the steps for the code:1. Define a function `interval_intersection` that takes two lists: `firstList` and `secondList` as argument.2. Initialize pointer `i` & `j` and an empty list `result` to store the intersections.3. Enter into a while loop; continue until `i` is less than the length of `firstList` and `j` is less than the length of `secondList`.4. Inside the while loop, find the maximum of `starti` & `startj` and the minimum of `endi` & `endj`. Let\'s call it `low` and `high` respectively.  5. If `low` <= `high`, it means there is an intersection. So, append `[low, high]` to `result`.6. If `endi` < `endj`, increment `i` . Otherwise increment `j`. This is because the interval which is ending first doesn\'t have any more common elements with the other list.7. After the while loop, return `result` and the total length of the intervals in `result` (which can be calculated as sum of all (`high - low + 1`) ).Here is the Python code:```pythondef interval_intersection(firstList, secondList):    i = j = 0    result = []    total_length = 0        while i < len(firstList) and j < len(secondList):        low = max(firstList[i][0], secondList[j][0])        high = min(firstList[i][1], secondList[j][1])                if low <= high:            result.append([low, high])            total_length += high - low + 1        if firstList[i][1] < secondList[j][1]:            i += 1        else:            j += 1    return result, total_length```This code will return the intersections and the total length of intersections for given `firstList` and `secondList`."},{"question":"Construct a TreeSet in Java containing the elements 23, 29, 31, 37, maintaining the natural ordering of elements.

If such a \'k\' does not exist, the function should return -1. Implement the program so that it is efficient for large lists.For example:Given the input list [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5], threshold=2, and k=2, the first function should return the list [2, 3, 3] and the second function should return 3. You must also handle cases where input list has multiple identical elements that meet the threshold and consider them individually, such as in the list [1,1,1,2,2,2,2,4,4], threshold=3, and k=2, the first function should return [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2] and the second function should return 1.","answer":"Here is the Python code that solves the problem:```pythonfrom collections import Counterdef threshold_list(lst, threshold):    count = Counter(lst)    new_list = [i for i in lst if count[i] > threshold]    return new_listdef kth_smallest(lst, k):    lst.sort()     if len(lst) >= k:        return lst[k-1]    else:        return -1input_list = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4]threshold = 3k = 2output_list = threshold_list(input_list, threshold)print(output_list)  # output: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]print(kth_smallest(output_list, k))  # output: 1```The `threshold_list()` function starts by creating a frequency map of the input list using Python\'s built-in `Counter` function from the `collections` module. This function maps each value in the list to the number of times it occurs in the list. We then use a list comprehension to build a new list with values that occur more than the threshold. We keep the original order and repeats of the elements which occur more than the threshold times.The `kth_smallest()` function sorts the output list from `threshold_list()` in ascending order using Python\'s built-in `sort` method, which sorts the list in-place. If there are at least \'k\' elements in the list, it returns the element at index (k - 1). If there are less than \'k\' elements in the list, it returns -1.This solution is efficient as it uses Python\'s built-in data structures and functions, which are implemented in C under the hood and are typically faster than their pure Python counterparts. It retains elements that cross the threshold by their original order and considers their total number individually.

It accepts an input from the user which specifies how many terms of the series are needed and then using the `fibonacciSeries` function, the series upto `n` terms is printed. In the function, `a` and `b` stores the first two terms of the series and in each iteration of the loop, next term is computed as the sum of `a` and `b`. These two terms are then updated for the next iteration. For the first two iterations ( i = 0 and i = 1 ), instead of the sum of `a` and `b`, the index `i` itself is printed. Please note that index is starting from 0, hence the first two terms of the series are 0 and 1.

Why one would not think that the multiresolution would also respond linearly to dilated versions of the same input?Would a logarithmic resampling of the input help?","answer":"The multi-resolution analysis (MRA) is not scale-equivariant because translations and scale changes have different effects on the signals. While a translation corresponds to shifting a signal in time (horizontal movement), a scale change corresponds to stretching or compressing the signal (vertical movement). In MRA, the scaling operation affects the frequency content of the signal. When the signal undergoes a scaling operation, it changes the frequency components of your signal. For example, if you stretch a signal, its frequency components become lower (because the signal changes slower), and if you compress a signal, its frequency components become higher (because the signal changes faster). This change cannot be represented as a simple permutation of the wavelet coefficients, as in the case of time translations.As for whether logarithmic resampling of the input would help, it would change the frequency representation of the signal, potentially making the analysis more sensitive to scale changes but, given the reasons above, it won\'t make the representation scale-equivariant. The transformed version of a signal after scaling is fundamentally different from the original, and cannot be recovered through a simple rearrangement of coefficients. Equally important, mathematically, scale and translation form part of different groups - in particular, translations form an abelian (commutative) group, while dilations do not commute - and so will have different commutation relations and thus, different representations. Most wavelets are designed to offer a trade-off between time and frequency resolution, but they do not necessarily give equal importance to changes in both domains."},{"question":"Could you please adjust the supplied Python function below to function as per advanced mathematical principles, where it would yield the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of the two parameters that are passed into it?def lowest_common_multiple(x, y):    pass","answer":"Sure, here\'s your revised Python function.

Please summarize the main contribution of the work in a single sentence. Your response should include the summary and no additional text.Paper text:This work introduces a simple network for producing character aware word embeddings.Position agnostic and position aware character embeddings are combined to produce an embedding vector for each word.The learned word representations are shown to be very sparse and facilitate improved results on language modeling tasks, despite using markedly fewer parameters, and without the need to apply dropout.A final experiment suggests that weight sharing contributes to sparsity, increases performance, and prevents overfitting.When processing text for Natural Language Processing (NLP), one important decision to make is how to represent the words for a given model or system.For many tasks tackled by deep learning such as language modeling, language understanding, and translation, the use of word embeddings has become the standard approach.BID20 BID4 BID0 This is in part due to their ability to represent complex syntactic and semantic relationships between words as spatial relationships within the embedding dimensions BID13 .Embeddingsare generally implemented as a lookup table for computational efficiency. However forthose unfamiliar with their use it may be beneficial to formulate them as the output of the first layer in a neural network. This is truefor a layer that has one-hot feature vectors as inputs, no bias, and no activation function.For a given one-hot feature vector x, the activations of such a layer can be computed by xW , which is equivalent to selecting the row W i of the weight matrix, where x i == 1. The weight matrixor embedding lookup matrix can then be optimized via typical techniques such as gradient descent, including from subsequent layers of a DNN through back propagation. BID15 For word embeddings, the basic approach is to assign a unique vector of trainable parameters to each word in a vocabulary. These vectors are referredto in this paper as token embeddings. Token embeddings present anumber of limitations. For example, any out-of-vocabularyword cannot be represented except as a pre-defined < U N K > token. A corollary of this is that the numberof embeddings (and therefore trainable parameters) grows linearly with the size of the vocabulary. Furthermore, characters are ignored, meaningthat potentially useful morphological information is thrown out.To get around these limitations, researchers have explored building word embeddings from lower level character representations. A variety of techniques have been presented,including the use of feedforward multi layer perceptrons (MLPs) BID3 , convolutional neural networks (CNNs) BID9 BID10 , and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) BID12 . These character level representations of wordshave the advantage over token embeddings of allowing an open vocabulary, usually having fewer parameters, and improving performance by making use of information available in sub-word level features.The most successful approaches for building word embeddings from characters use CNNs. BID9 However, the architecture of CNNs is designedto identify positioninvariant features, not the specific ordering of characters that make up a word\'s spelling. Here we ask whether such ordering is a valuable sourceof information.A number of convolutional features of varying size can be used to capture some ordering, for example within each feature independently. However as the vocabulary is expanded, the number convolutionalfeatures must be increased to compensate BID9 . Once convolution is performed, the used of a deep highway network, as introduced by BID18 , is then needed to produce the final word embedding.The current study presents a simple fully connected architecture for combining characters. In this framework, each character is represented both by position-agnosticcharacter embeddings and position-aware character embeddings, which we call spelling embeddings. The combination of the two allows the model to learn both position invariantfeatures and positional features. A word embedding is then constructed by combining both the character and spellingembeddings of the word, for example by summing or by averaging them together. The resulting vector is then passed through a nonlinear MLP that combines the characterand spelling information to produce the final word embedding.This MLP, along with the spelling and character embeddings, were trained via gradient descent as inputs to a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) being trained for a language modeling task. Results show that including the spelling information facilitates improvement over tokenembeddings despite requiring far fewer parameters. Without the position information, character embeddings alone are not sufficient in thisfully connected architecture.An analysis of the learned representations at the word embedding level shows much greater sparsity for spelling embeddings than for token embeddings, and demonstrates some of the negative impacts of dropout on the representations. Finally, we compare token based models with a fully connected layer of shared weights toraw token embeddings with no weight sharing. Passing the token embeddings through a layer of shared weights is shown to drastically increaserepresentation sparsity and prevent overfitting. Given that the character and spelling weights are heavily shared among word embeddings, this ispresented as possible explanation for the spelling aware model\'s robustness against overfitting.This work shows that a simple fully connected network is able to produce character aware word embeddings that outperform traditional token embeddings.The architecture is relatively simple compared to previous approaches that use CNNs or RNNs to combine character information.This work lacks a direct comparison to these other character aware methods, which is an obvious direction for future work.Investigation into the word embeddings produced by the presented architectures reveal a number of interesting properties.Spelling embeddings are especially resistant to overfitting compared to token embeddings, and are also significantly more sparse in their activations.Furthermore, dropout is shown to have some negative impacts on the word representations, and weight sharing is presented as a better way to regularize word embeddings.Spelling embeddings exhibit the most weight sharing, because each character embedding is shared across many words in the vocabulary.This may be a contributing factor to their increased sparsity and resistance to overfitting.Additional evidence for this is provided in the comparison of raw token embeddings to those passed through a fully connected layer.Whereas raw token embeddings share none of their weights with other words in the vocabulary, token embeddings passed through a fully connected layer share all the weights in that layer across the entire vocabulary.Not only do token embeddings enjoy increased resistance to overfitting when passed though a shared weight layer, they also become drastically more sparse.Whereas dropout is a popular technique for regularization in NLP, it can have a negative impact on the word embeddings, causing some of them to gain a Gini coefficient of 0.This suggests that these particular words have completely homogeneous representations and are indistinguishable from each other.On the smaller dataset the number of shared parameters in the fully connected layer of the token embeddings is large compared to the vocabulary size.In this case, dropout is needed to prevent overfitting.On the larger dataset, the number of shared parameters is much smaller relative to the vocabulary size.In this case dropout is not needed for the token embeddings and actually hinders them.The spelling embeddings perform worse with dropout on both datasets.The architecture presented here should be compared to the state of the art character CNN results obtained on the One Billion Word benchmark.BID9 ) Also, whereas a number hyper-parameters governing the number and size of the layers were tried before the ones presented in this paper were found, other techniques such as highway networks BID18 have not yet been investigated.Furthermore, extending the concept of character aware word embeddings to the output softmax layer is another open area of research that has been tried with character CNNs BID9 , but not to our knowledge with a spelling network as presented in this work.","answer":"A fully connected architecture is used to produce word embeddings from character representations, outperforms traditional embeddings and provides insight into sparsity and dropout."},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

As at 21 February, nine European countries reported 47 cases. Among 38 cases studied, 21 were linked to two clusters in Germany and France, 14 were infected in China. Median case age was 42 years; 25 were male. Late detection of the clusters’ index cases delayed isolation of further local cases. As at 5 March, there were 4,250 cases. Text: In the WHO European Region, COVID-19 surveillance was implemented 27 January 2020. We detail the first European cases. As at 21 February, nine European countries reported 47 cases. Among 38 cases studied, 21 were linked to two clusters in Germany and France, 14 were infected in China. Median case age was 42 years; 25 were male. Late detection of the clusters\' index cases delayed isolation of further local cases. As at 5 March, there were 4,250 cases. A cluster of pneumonia of unknown origin was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [1] . On 12 January 2020, Chinese authorities shared the sequence of a novel coronavirus termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolated from some clustered cases [2] . Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) . As at 21 February 2020, the virus had spread rapidly mostly within China but also to 28 other countries, including in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region [3] [4] [5] . Here we describe the epidemiology of the first cases of COVID-19 in this region, excluding cases reported in the United Kingdom (UK), as at 21 February 2020. The study includes a comparison between cases detected among travellers from China and cases whose infection was acquired due to subsequent local transmission. On 27 January 2020, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe asked countries to complete a WHO standard COVID-19 case report form for all confirmed and probable cases according to WHO criteria [6] [7] [8] . The overall aim of surveillance at this time was to support the global strategy of containment of COVID-19 with rapid identification and follow-up of cases linked to affected countries in order to minimise onward transmission. The surveillance objectives were to: describe the key epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases detected in Europe; inform country preparedness; and improve further case detection and management. Data collected included demographics, history of recent travel to affected areas, close contact with a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, underlying conditions, signs and symptoms of disease at onset, type of specimens from which the virus was detected, and clinical outcome. The WHO case definition was adopted for surveillance: a confirmed case was a person with laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (ECDC recommended two separate SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests), irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms, whereas a probable case was a suspect case for whom testing for SARS-CoV-2 was inconclusive or positive using a pan-coronavirus assay [8] . By 31 January 2020, 47 laboratories in 31 countries, including 38 laboratories in 24 European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries, had diagnostic capability for SARS-CoV-2 available (close to 60% of countries in the WHO European Region), with cross-border shipment arrangements in place for many of those lacking domestic testing capacity. The remaining six EU/EEA countries were expected to have diagnostic testing available by mid-February [9] . As at 09:00 on 21 February 2020, 47 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in the WHO European Region and one of these cases had died [4] . Data on 38 of these cases (i.e. all except the nine reported in the UK) are included in this analysis. The first three cases detected were reported in France on 24 January 2020 and had onset of symptoms on 17, 19 and 23 January respectively [10] . The first death was reported on 15 February in France. As at 21 February, nine countries had reported cases ( Figure) : Belgium (1), Finland (1), France (12), Germany (16), Italy (3), Russia (2), Spain (2), Sweden (1) and the UK (9 -not included further). The place of infection (assessed at national level based on an incubation period presumed to be up to 14 days [11] , travel history and contact with probable or confirmed cases as per the case definition) was reported for 35 cases (missing for three cases), of whom 14 were infected in China (Hubei province: 10 cases; Shandong province: one case; province not reported for three cases). The remaining 21 cases were infected in Europe. Of these, 14 were linked to a cluster in Bavaria, Germany, and seven to a cluster in Haute-Savoie, France [12, 13] . Cases from the Bavarian cluster were reported from Germany and Spain, whereas cases from the Haute-Savoie cluster were reported from France All but two cases were hospitalised (35 of 37 where information on hospitalisation was reported), although it is likely that most were hospitalised to isolate the person rather than because of severe disease. The time from onset of symptoms to hospitalisation (and isolation) ranged between 0 and 10 days with a mean of 3.7 days (reported for 29 cases). The mean number of days to hospitalisation was 2.5 days for cases imported from China, but 4.6 days for those infected in Europe. This was mostly a result of delays in identifying the index cases of the two clusters in France and Germany. In the German cluster, for example, the first three cases detected locally were hospitalised in a mean of 5.7 days, whereas the following six took only a mean of 2 days to be hospitalised. Symptoms at the point of diagnosis were reported for 31 cases. Two cases were asymptomatic and remained so until tested negative. The asymptomatic cases were tested as part of screening following repatriation and during contact tracing respectively. Of the remaining 29, 20 reported fever, 14 reported cough and eight reported weakness. Additional symptoms reported included headaches (6 cases), sore throat (2), rhinorrhoea (2), shortness of breath (2), myalgia (1), diarrhoea (1) and nausea (1). Fever was reported as the sole symptom for nine cases. In 16 of 29 symptomatic cases, the symptoms at diagnosis were consistent with the case definition for acute respiratory infection [16] , although it is possible that cases presented additional symptoms after diagnosis and these were not reported. Data on pre-existing conditions were reported for seven cases ; five had no pre-existing conditions while one was reported to be obese and one had pre-existing cardiac disease. No data on clinical signs e.g. dyspnea etc. were reported for any of the 38 cases. All hospitalised cases had a benign clinical evolution except four, two reported in Italy and two reported in France, all of whom developed viral pneumonia. All three cases who were aged 65 years or over were admitted to intensive care and required respiratory support and one French case died. The case who died was hospitalised for 21 days and required intensive care and mechanical ventilation for 19 days. The duration of hospitalisation was reported for 16 cases with a median of 13 days (range: 8-23 days). As at 21 February 2020, four cases were still hospitalised. All cases were confirmed according to specific assays targeting at least two separate genes (envelope (E) gene as a screening test and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene or nucleoprotein (N) gene for confirmation) [8, 17] . The specimen types tested were reported for 27 cases: 15 had positive nasopharyngeal swabs, nine had positive throat swabs, three cases had positive sputum, two had a positive nasal swab, one case had a positive nasopharyngeal aspirate and one a positive endotracheal aspirate. As at 09:00 on 21 February, few COVID-19 cases had been detected in Europe compared with Asia. However the situation is rapidly developing, with a large outbreak recently identified in northern Italy, with transmission in several municipalities and at least two deaths [18] . As at 5 March 2020, there are 4,250 cases including 113 deaths reported among 38 countries in the WHO European region [19] . In our analysis of early cases, we observed transmission in two broad contexts: sporadic cases among travellers from China (14 cases) and cases who acquired infection due to subsequent local transmission in Europe (21 cases). Our analysis shows that the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation/case isolation was about 3 days longer for locally acquired cases than for imported cases. People returning from affected areas are likely to have a low threshold to seek care and be tested when symptomatic, however delays in identifying the index cases of the two clusters in France and Germany meant that locally acquired cases took longer to be detected and isolated. Once the exposure is determined and contacts identified and quarantined (171 contacts in France and 200 in Germany for the clusters in Haute-Savoie and Bavaria, respectively), further cases are likely to be rapidly detected and isolated when they develop symptoms [15, 20] . In the German cluster, for example, the first three cases detected locally were hospitalised in a mean of 5.7 days, whereas the following six were hospitalised after a mean of 2 days. Locally acquired cases require significant resources for contact tracing and quarantine, and countries should be prepared to allocate considerable public health resources during the containment phase, should local clusters emerge in their population. In addition, prompt sharing of information on cases and contacts through international notification systems such as the International Health Regulations (IHR) mechanism and the European Commission\'s European Early Warning and Response System is essential to contain international spread of infection. All of the imported cases had a history of travel to China. This was consistent with the epidemiological situation in Asia, and supported the recommendation for testing of suspected cases with travel history to China and potentially other areas of presumed ongoing community transmission. The situation has evolved rapidly since then, however, and the number of countries reporting COVID-19 transmission increased rapidly, notably with a large outbreak in northern Italy with 3,089 cases reported as at 5 March [18, 19] . Testing of suspected cases based on geographical risk of importation needs to be complemented with additional approaches to ensure early detection of local circulation of COVID-19, including through testing of severe acute respiratory infections in hospitals irrespectively of travel history as recommended in the WHO case definition updated on 27 February 2020 [21] . The clinical presentation observed in the cases in Europe is that of an acute respiratory infection. However, of the 31 cases with information on symptoms, 20 cases presented with fever and nine cases presented only with fever and no other symptoms. These findings, which are consistent with other published case series, have prompted ECDC to include fever among several clinical signs or symptoms indicative for the suspected case definition. Three cases were aged 65 years or over. All required admission to intensive care and were tourists (imported cases). These findings could reflect the average older age of the tourist population compared with the local contacts exposed to infection in Europe and do not allow us to draw any conclusion on the proportion of severe cases that we could expect in the general population of Europe. Despite this, the finding of older individuals being at higher risk of a severe clinical course is consistent with the evidence from Chinese case series published so far although the majority of infections in China have been mild [22, 23] . This preliminary analysis is based on the first reported cases of COVID-19 cases in the WHO European Region. Given the small sample size, and limited completeness for some variables, all the results presented should be interpreted with caution. With increasing numbers of cases in Europe, data from surveillance and investigations in the region can build on the evidence from countries in Asia experiencing more widespread transmission particularly on disease spectrum and the proportion of infections with severe outcome [22] . Understanding the infection-severity is critical to help plan for the impact on the healthcare system and the wider population. Serological studies are vital to understand the proportion of cases who are asymptomatic. Hospital-based surveillance could help estimate the incidence of severe cases and identify risk factors for severity and death. Established hospital surveillance systems that are in place for influenza and other diseases in Europe may be expanded for this purpose. In addition, a number of countries in Europe are adapting and, in some cases, already using existing sentinel primary care based surveillance systems for influenza to detect community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This approach will be used globally to help identify evidence of widespread community transmission and, should the virus spread and containment no longer be deemed feasible, to monitor intensity of disease transmission, trends and its geographical spread. Additional research is needed to complement surveillance data to build knowledge on the infectious period, modes of transmission, basic and effective reproduction numbers, and effectiveness of prevention and case management options also in settings outside of China. Such special studies are being conducted globally, including a cohort study on citizens repatriated from China to Europe, with the aim to extrapolate disease incidence and risk factors for infection in areas with community transmission. Countries together with ECDC and WHO, should use all opportunities to address these questions in a coordinated fashion at the European and global level. provided input to the outline, multiple versions of the manuscript and gave approval to the final draft.Question: How many cases had data on preexisting conditions?","answer":"seven cases"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

Some researchers propose to use the conditional variational autoencoder(CVAE) which maximizes the lower bound on the conditional log-likelihood on a continuous latent variable. With different sampled la-tent variables, the model is expected to generate diverse responses. Although the CVAE-based models have shown tremendous potential, their improvement of generating high-quality responses is still unsatisfactory. In this paper, we introduce a discrete latent variable with an explicit semantic meaning to improve the CVAE on short-text conversation. A major advantage of our model is that we can exploit the semantic distance between the latent variables to maintain good diversity between the sampled latent variables. Accordingly, we pro-pose a two-stage sampling approach to enable efficient diverse variable selection from a large latent space assumed in the short-text conversation task. Experimental results indicate that our model outperforms various kinds of generation models under both automatic and human evaluations and generates more diverse and in-formative responses.IntroductionOpen-domain response generation BIBREF0, BIBREF1 for single-round short text conversation BIBREF2, aims at generating a meaningful and interesting response given a query from human users. Neural generation models are of growing interest in this topic due to their potential to leverage massive conversational datasets on the web. These generation models such as encoder-decoder models BIBREF3, BIBREF2, BIBREF4, directly build a mapping from the input query to its output response, which treats all query-response pairs uniformly and optimizes the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). However, when the models converge, they tend to output bland and generic responses BIBREF5, BIBREF6, BIBREF7.Many enhanced encoder-decoder approaches have been proposed to improve the quality of generated responses. They can be broadly classified into two categories (see Section SECREF2 for details): (1) One that does not change the encoder-decoder framework itself. These approaches only change the decoding strategy, such as encouraging diverse tokens to be selected in beam search BIBREF5, BIBREF8; or adding more components based on the encoder-decoder framework, such as the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods BIBREF9, BIBREF10, BIBREF11 which add discriminators to perform adversarial training; (2) The second category modifies the encoder-decoder framework directly by incorporating useful information as latent variables in order to generate more specific responses BIBREF12, BIBREF13. However, all these enhanced methods still optimize the MLE of the log-likelihood or the complete log-likelihood conditioned on their assumed latent information, and models estimated by the MLE naturally favor to output frequent patterns in training data.Instead of optimizing the MLE, some researchers propose to use the conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), which maximizes the lower bound on the conditional data log-likelihood on a continuous latent variable BIBREF14, BIBREF15. Open-domain response generation is a one-to-many problem, in which a query can be associated with many valid responses. The CVAE-based models generally assume the latent variable follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix, which can capture the latent distribution over all valid responses. With different sampled latent variables, the model is expected to decode diverse responses. Due to the advantage of the CVAE in modeling the response generation process, we focus on improving the performance of the CVAE-based response generation models.Although the CVAE has achieved impressive results on many generation problems BIBREF16, BIBREF17, recent results on response generation show that the CVAE-based generation models still suffer from the low output diversity problem. That is multiple sampled latent variables result in responses with similar semantic meanings. To address this problem, extra guided signals are often used to improve the basic CVAE. BIBREF14 zhao2017learning use dialogue acts to capture the discourse variations in multi-round dialogues as guided knowledge. However, such discourse information can hardly be extracted for short-text conversation.In our work, we propose a discrete CVAE (DCVAE), which utilizes a discrete latent variable with an explicit semantic meaning in the CVAE for short-text conversation. Our model mitigates the low output diversity problem in the CVAE by exploiting the semantic distance between the latent variables to maintain good diversity between the sampled latent variables. Accordingly, we propose a two-stage sampling approach to enable efficient selection of diverse variables from a large latent space assumed in the short-text conversation task.To summarize, this work makes three contributions: (1) We propose a response generation model for short-text conversation based on a DCVAE, which utilizes a discrete latent variable with an explicit semantic meaning and could generate high-quality responses. (2) A two-stage sampling approach is devised to enable efficient selection of diverse variables from a large latent space assumed in the short-text conversation task. (3) Experimental results show that the proposed DCVAE with the two-stage sampling approach outperforms various kinds of generation models under both automatic and human evaluations, and generates more high-quality responses. All our code and datasets are available at https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/nlp/dialogue.Related Work ::: The CVAE-based modelsA few works indicate that it is worth trying to apply the CVAE to dialogue generation which is originally used in image generation BIBREF16, BIBREF17 and optimized with the variational lower bound of the conditional log-likelihood. For task-oriented dialogues, BIBREF22 wen2017latent use the latent variable to model intentions in the framework of neural variational inference. For chit-chat multi-round conversations, BIBREF23 serban2017hierarchical model the generative process with multiple levels of variability based on a hierarchical sequence-to-sequence model with a continuous high-dimensional latent variable. BIBREF14 zhao2017learning make use of the CVAE and the latent variable is used to capture discourse-level variations. BIBREF24 gu2018dialogwae propose to induce the latent variables by transforming context-dependent Gaussian noise. BIBREF15 shen2017conditional present a conditional variational framework for generating specific responses based on specific attributes. Yet, it is observed in other tasks such as image captioning BIBREF25 and question generation BIBREF26 that the CVAE-based generation models suffer from the low output diversity problem, i.e. multiple sampled variables point to the same generated sequences. In this work, we utilize a discrete latent variable with an interpretable meaning to alleviate this low output diversity problem on short-text conversation.We find that BIBREF27 zhao2018unsupervised make use of a set of discrete variables that define high-level attributes of a response. Although they interpret meanings of the learned discrete latent variables by clustering data according to certain classes (e.g. dialog acts), such latent variables still have no exact meanings. In our model, we connect each latent variable with a word in the vocabulary, thus each latent variable has an exact semantic meaning. Besides, they focus on multi-turn dialogue generation and presented an unsupervised discrete sentence representation learning method learned from the context while our concentration is primarily on single-turn dialogue generation with no context information.Proposed Models ::: DCVAE and Basic Network ModulesFollowing previous CVAE-based generation models BIBREF14, we introduce a latent variable z for each input sequence and our goal is to maximize the lower bound on the conditional data log-likelihood p(mathbf {y}|mathbf {x}), where mathbf {x} is the input query sequence and mathbf {y} is the target response sequence:Here, p(z|mathbf {x})/q(z|mathbf {y},mathbf {x})/p(mathbf {y}|mathbf {x},z) is parameterized by the prior/posterior/generation network respectively. D_{KL}(q(z|mathbf {y},mathbf {x})||p(z|mathbf {x})) is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the posterior and prior distribution. Generally, z is set to follow a Gaussian distribution in both the prior and posterior networks. As mentioned in the related work, directly using the above CVAE formulation causes the low output diversity problem. This observation is also validated in the short-text conversation task in our experiments.Now, we introduce our basic discrete CVAE formulation to alleviate the low output diversity problem. We change the continuous latent variable z to a discrete latent one with an explicit interpretable meaning, which could actively control the generation of the response. An intuitive way is to connect each latent variable with a word in the vocabulary. With a sampled latent z from the prior (in testing)/posterior network (in training), the generation network will take the query representation together with the word embedding of this latent variable as the input to decode the response. Here, we assume that a single word is enough to drive the generation network to output diverse responses for short text conversation, in which the response is generally short and compact.A major advantage of our DCVAE is that for words with far different meanings, their word embeddings (especially that we use a good pre-trained word embedding corpus) generally have a large distance and drive the generation network to decode scattered responses, thus improve the output diversity. In the standard CVAE, z\'s assumed in a continuous space may not maintain the semantic distance as in the embedding space and diverse z\'s may point to the same semantic meaning, in which case the generation network is hard to train well with such confusing information. Moreover, we can make use of the semantic distance between latent variables to perform better sampling to approximate the objective during optimization, which will be introduced in Section SECREF10.The latent variable z is thus set to follow a categorical distribution with each dimension corresponding to a word in the vocabulary. Therefore the prior and posterior networks should output categorical probability distributions:where theta  and phi  are parameters of the two networks respectively. The KL distance of these two distributions can be calculated in a closed form solution:where Z contains all words in the vocabulary.In the following, we present the details of the prior, posterior and generation network.Prior network p(z|mathbf {x}): It aims at inferring the latent variable z given the input sequence x. We first obtain an input representation mathbf {h}_{mathbf {x}}^{p} by encoding the input query mathbf {x} with a bi-directional GRU and then compute g_{theta }(mathbf {x}) in Eq. as follows:where theta  contains parameters in both the bidirectional GRU and Eq. DISPLAY_FORM8.Posterior network q(z|mathbf {y}, mathbf {x}): It infers a latent variable z given a input query mathbf {x} and its target response mathbf {y}. We construct both representations for the input and the target sequence by separated bi-directional GRU\'s, then add them up to compute f_{phi }(mathbf {y}, mathbf {x}) in Eq. to predict the probability of z:where phi  contains parameters in the two encoding functions and Eq. DISPLAY_FORM9. Note that the parameters of the encoding functions are not shared in the prior and posterior network.Generation network p(mathbf {y}|mathbf {x},z): We adopt an encoder-decoder model with attention BIBREF28 used in the decoder. With a sampled latent variable z, a typical strategy is to combine its representation, which in this case is the word embedding mathbf {e}_z of z, only in the beginning of decoding. However, many previous works observe that the influence of the added information will vanish over time BIBREF12, BIBREF21. Thus, after obtaining an attentional hidden state at each decoding step, we concatenate the representation mathbf {h}_z of the latent variable and the current hidden state to produce a final output in our generation network.Experimental SettingsNext, we describe our experimental settings including the dataset, implementation details, all compared methods, and the evaluation metrics.Experimental Settings ::: EvaluationTo evaluate the responses generated by all compared methods, we compute the following automatic metrics on our test set:BLEU: BLEU-n measures the average n-gram precision on a set of reference responses. We report BLEU-n with n=1,2,3,4.Distinct-1 & distinct-2 BIBREF5: We count the numbers of distinct uni-grams and bi-grams in the generated responses and divide the numbers by the total number of generated uni-grams and bi-grams in the test set. These metrics can be regarded as an automatic metric to evaluate the diversity of the responses.Three annotators from a commercial annotation company are recruited to conduct our human evaluation. Responses from different models are shuffled for labeling. 300 test queries are randomly selected out, and annotators are asked to independently score the results of these queries with different points in terms of their quality: (1) Good (3 points): The response is grammatical, semantically relevant to the query, and more importantly informative and interesting; (2) Acceptable (2 points): The response is grammatical, semantically relevant to the query, but too trivial or generic (e.g.,“我不知道(I don\'t know)\\", “我也是(Me too)”, “我喜欢(I like it)\\" etc.); (3) Failed (1 point): The response has grammar mistakes or irrelevant to the query.ConclusionIn this paper, we have presented a novel response generation model for short-text conversation via a discrete CVAE. We replace the continuous latent variable in the standard CVAE by an interpretable discrete variable, which is set to a word in the vocabulary. The sampled latent word has an explicit semantic meaning, acting as a guide to the generation of informative and diverse responses. We also propose to use a two-stage sampling approach to enable efficient selection of diverse variables from a large latent space, which is very essential for our model. Experimental results show that our model outperforms various kinds of generation models under both automatic and human evaluations.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61751206, 61876120).Figure 4: (a)/(b): Automatic/human evaluation on the DCVAE with/without the two-stage sampling approach.

A phase I/II study was carried out to determine the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel ( Taxol ; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company , Princeton , NJ ) in combination with a fixed dose of carboplatin ( area under the concentration-time curve = 6 by Calvert method ) given on an every-3-week schedule to patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Cohorts of patients were entered at increasing dose levels of paclitaxel: six at dose level I (paclitaxel 150 mg/m2), six at dose level 2 (paclitaxel 175 mg/m2), 11 at dose level 3 (paclitaxel 200 mg/ m2), 21 at dose level 4 (paclitaxel 225 mg/m2), and five at dose level 5 (paclitaxel 250 mg/m2). The patients comprised 31 men and 18 women with a median age of 62 years (age range, 46 to 81 years) and a median Southwest Oncology Group performance status of I (range, 0 to 2). Twenty-three patients had unresectable stage III NSCLC and 26 had stage IV NSCLC. Fortynine patients and 176 treatment courses are evaluable for toxicity. Grade 4 neutropenia or grade 3 arthralgias/ myalgias or sensory neuropathy were the most significant toxicities of therapy. In addition, two patients (dose levels 2 and 3) experienced acute chest pain, flushing, and hypotension, and had electrocardiogram changes during the paclitaxel infusion; one had mild creatine phosphokidnase MB elevation. Both recovered uneventfully, were not re-treated with paclitaxel, and account for two of only four hospitalizations for toxicity management in this trial. At this time, 42 patients with objectively measurable disease are evaluable for responses: two complete responses and 24 partial responses (62% objective response rate) have been observed. These data imply that the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel is 250 mg/m2 with dose-limiting toxicity consisting primarily of grade 3 osteo/arthralgias-myalgias or cumulative sensory neuropathy; paclitaxel at a dose of 225 mg/m2 given by 3-hour infusion combined with carboplatin at a calculated target area under the concentration-time curve of 6 is a well-tolerated outpatient treatment regimen and highly active in NSCLC; myelosuppression is mild and rarely dose limiting.

Production of hyperpolarized (HP) contrast agents for clinical and industrial applications is a rapidly developing field. The most widespread hyperpolarization techniques in the context of biomedical applications are dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (d-DNP),[1b, 2] spin-exchange optical pumping (SEOP)[3] and parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP).[4] D-DNP is well established for production of HP solutions of metabolites (e.g. pyruvate), which can be used as contrast agents for molecular imaging of cancer[5] and other pathologies.[6] HP noble gases (e.g. 129Xe or 3He) obtained by SEOP can be employed for functional MRI of lungs[7] and other applications.[8] However, both DNP and SEOP techniques have significant drawbacks: ~ 1 h long polarization cycles, expensive and sophisticated hardware. Moreover, MRI detection of heteronuclei (i.e., other than proton) is not common for standard clinical MRI facilities. On the other hand, PHIP technique for production of proton-hyperpolarized gases obviates all of the above shortcomings, because it is very simple and instrumentationally non-demanding. In PHIP, singlet spin order of parahydrogen (p-H2) is used to create non-equilibrium spin states[4a] via pairwise addition of two atoms from the same p-H2 molecule to some asymmetric unsaturated substrate (Figure 1a). Once the symmetry of p-H2 molecule is broken as the nascent parahydrogen protons become magnetically non-equivalent in the reaction product, a non-equilibrium nuclear spin polarization is produced, which can be conveniently detected using conventional proton detection universally available on nearly all NMR spectrometers and MRI scanners.</p><p>Despite the initial PHIP phenomenon discovery in the 1980s,[4a] it was deemed to be relatively impractical to design molecular contrast agents with hyperpolarization pool stored on protons, because of their relatively short T1 resulting in rapid (few seconds or less) depolarization. Indeed, much of the later biomedical efforts were focused on polarization transfer from nascent parahydrogen protons to significantly slower relaxing (a minute or more) 13C sites for in vivo angiography[9] and molecular imaging[10] applications. However, the discovery of the long-lived spin states[11] (LLSS) provided a glimpse of hope that the lifetime of proton HP for contrast agents produced by PHIP could be extended. Indeed, LLSS of HP protons in gaseous propane were recently demonstrated with TLLSS reaching 5–6 s,[12] which is sufficiently long for potential biomedical use as inhalable contrast agents for functional pulmonary imaging.</p><p>HP propane is a non-toxic gas[13] and is a promising alternative to HP 129Xe, because its PHIP production is relatively inexpensive, its NMR/MRI detection does not require specialized 129Xe radiofrequency hardware and software, and it can enable 3D MRI with superb spatial (~0.5×0.5×0.5 mm3 voxel size) resolution even at nuclear spin polarization (%PH) of ~1%.[12] Increasing the %PH of propane and other HP gases is certainly required, and it is an area of extensive experimental efforts.[14]</p><p>Pairwise p-H2 addition can be achieved by either homogeneous[9] or heterogeneous (HET)[15] catalysis. The important advantage of HET-PHIP is the ability to produce pure HP gases, e.g. propane.[12a, 14a, 14c] However, the level of proton polarization of HP propane produced by HET-PHIP is relatively low at %PH~1%.[14a] An alternative approach is the biphasic gas-liquid hydrogenation of propene by bubbling its mixture with p-H2 through a catalyst solution.[16] This approach also allows producing HP propane in the gas phase in a continuous flow regime, however %PH achieved to date were relatively low, i.e. < 1%. In principle, near 100% pairwise addition of p-H2 is theoretically possible,[4a, 4b] and because of our long-term goal of using HP propane as HP inhalable contrast agent, the motivation for this work is to improve %PH of HP propane via PHIP. Herein, we explore PHIP of propane using a previously established batch-mode approach for production of injectable contrast agents,[9, 17] where catalyst and to-be-hyperpolarized substrate are loaded in the liquid phase first, which is followed by pairwise addition of p-H2 gas and produces a batch of HP contrast agent.</p><p>In this study, we utilized the [Rh(L)(dppb)]BF4 complex most widely used in PHIP experiments as a catalyst for p-H2 pairwise addition (L = NBD (norbornadiene) or = COD (cyclooctadiene), dppb = 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane). First, the simultaneous loading of propene and p-H2 into the catalyst solution in a continuous flow regime was tested, similarly to the experimental protocol used previously.[16] However, here an elevated p-H2 pressure (~7 atm vs. 1 atm) was employed (Figure 2), because it increases p-H2 concentration in the liquid phase[18] and consequently increases the rate of hydrogenation.[17b] NMR detection of HP propane was performed in the liquid phase of methanol-d4. HP NMR resonances of propane were observed under both ALTADENA[19] and PASADENA[4b] conditions with good reproducibility (> 10 experiments were repeated on the same catalyst solution portion, Figures S2 and S3). However, the NMR signal enhancements (SE) of HP propane\'s methyl and methylene resonances were low (only ca. 3–10 fold, corresponding to %PH of 0.01–0.03% using ~50% p-H2).</p><p>In the batch-mode approach, propene is loaded first (by saturating the catalyst solution by propene bubbling at 1 atm pressure) followed by pressurizing the sample and bubbling with p-H2 through the solution at ~7.1 atm. This experimental protocol is ~100 times more efficient than the continuous-flow method described above, and yielded signal enhancements and polarizations as high as SE ~ 1910 and %PH ~ 6.2% under ALTADENA conditions (Figure 2) using ~80% p-H2 without taking into account possible polarization losses due to relaxation processes. Correspondingly, when ~50% p-H2 was used (Figure S8), SE and %PH were decreased to 840 and 2.7% respectively.</p><p>The comparison of two catalysts at several concentrations shown in Figure 3a clearly indicates that the catalyst performance with NBD ligand is significantly better than that with COD ligand. Additionally, in both cases, catalyst concentration also impacts the apparent %PH. Moreover, Figure 3b shows a definite advantage of using high p-H2 pressure for improving apparent %PH for HP propane in liquid phase hydrogenation. Furthermore, additional experiments performed at various hydrogenation temperatures exhibit a temperature dependence of %PH as well (Figure 3c).</p><p>The potential possible explanation of such a dramatic difference in catalyst\'s performance between continuous-flow and batch mode hyperpolarization procedures is partially based on the differences in concentrations of reactants in the solution, which is in line with previously published studies. These studies reported high level of hyperpolarization achieved via batch-mode loading of substrate following by reaction with p-H2: i.e. utilizing 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate,[9] fumarate,[21] phosphoenolpyruvate,[22] and more recently vinyl acetate[17b, 23] with similar or identical catalyst, where high levels of hyperpolarization were detected for 1H[17b] or 13C[23b] nuclei (the latter is an indirect confirmation that proton polarization was high prior to polarization transfer from nascent parahydrogen protons[17b] to 13C[17b, 23b]) In case of separate loading of reactants using batch-mode production, the initial concentration of loaded propene is 330 ± 45 mM (according to reference signals of catalyst\'s thermally polarized protons). On the other hand, H2 solubility in methanol is only ~28 mM at 7.1 atm.[24] Moreover, simultaneous loading of propene and excess p-H2 in the continuous flow mode also likely results in the irreversible catalyst degradation of some fraction of Rh catalyst. This is indirectly confirmed by the fact that once the propene substrate is depleted in the batch-mode procedure, and the catalyst solution is further bubbled with p-H2, the subsequent attempts to re-load the propene substrate to repeat the hyperpolarization cycle were unsuccessful (i.e. > 1 order of magnitude lower polarization signals). Furthermore, continuous-flow mode experiments utilized somewhat lower p-H2 partial pressure likely resulting in a slower production of hyperpolarized product.</p><p>The reported here %PH value of ~6.2% was obtained with ~80 % p-H2, so that utilization of 100% p-H2 would increase proton polarization to ~9% for hyperpolarized propane.[25] This value is substantially higher than typical values reported for propane or any other hydrocarbon gas hyperpolarized by PHIP so far. For PHIP, the highest reported %PH value was ~1% for HP propane.[14a, 15b] To date, no other HP techniques have reported hyperpolarization on hydrocarbon gases. We note that although the nascent proton polarization in PHIP can exceed 50% for some injectable contrast agents,[17a, 26] (i) the direct proton detection is usually not performed in situ of production inside a hyperpolarizer, and (ii) proton polarization is too short-lived to be useful for injectable contrast agents. While d-DNP can hyperpolarize proton sites in principle,[27] no reports have been shown that d-DNP can efficiently hyperpolarize any gas besides 129Xe[28] and 15N2O.[29]</p><p>The presented polarization values are likely somewhat underestimated due to residual hydrogenation of substrate during the delay between the acquisitions of the ALTADENA spectrum and the spectrum of fully relaxed solution. This delay (of >2 min) is mandatory, because HP must return back to the equilibrium state for probing propane concentration in the solution; also note that the alternative efforts of using normal H2 at room temperature yielded small (yet detectable) HP signatures of propane, and therefore are unsuitable for quantification. The T1 relaxation time constants of propane HP states induced via ALTADENA condition in solution are 22.4±0.5 s for CH2 group and 16.1±0.3 s for CH3 group respectively, which is in qualitative agreement with T1 measurements of dissolved thermally-polarized propane using inversion recovery technique (23.3±0.3 s and 19.6±0.3 s respectively). These values are significantly greater than the corresponding relaxation decay constants of HP propane in the gas phase.[12a, 30] Moreover, the decay constants could be even greater at low magnetic fields due to LLSS presence.[12a] Therefore, the production of HP propane in the liquid (vs. gas) phase using the presented batch-mode approach may be advantageous, because the decay of the HP state can potentially minimize polarization losses, and hydrogenation process can continue significantly longer without significant polarization decay losses.</p><p>Future studies are certainly warranted to optimize the HP propane production by the batch-mode approach, including catalyst improvement to yield greater degree of the pairwise addition of p-H2 and greater % conversion (up to ~100% from the 40–80% conversion levels achieved here, Figure S6), further optimization of p-H2 pressure and reaction temperature, and others. Moreover, HP propane separation from the liquid phase and filtration from residual propene, H2 and norbornene/norbornane certainly have to be addressed in the context of potential biomedical use of HP propane gas, which was not pursued in the feasibility study described here.</p>Experimental Section<p>All experimental procedures, additional NMR spectra are provided in Supporting Information (SI) for this communication.</p>","answer":"We report on a simple approach for efficient NMR proton hyperpolarization of propane using parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) technique, which yielded ~6.2% proton polarization using ~80% parahydrogen, a record level achieved with any hyperpolarization technique for propane. Unlike in previously developed approaches designed for continuous flow operation, where reactants (propene and parahydrogen) are simultaneously loaded for homogeneous or heterogeneous pairwise addition of parahydrogen, here a batch-mode method was applied: propene was first loaded into the catalyst-containing solution, which was followed by homogeneous hydrogenation via parahydrogen bubbling delivered at ~7.1 atm. The achieved nuclear spin polarization of this contrast agent potentially useful for pulmonary imaging was approximately 2 orders of magnitude greater than that achieved in the continuous-flow homogeneous catalytic hydrogenation, and a factor of 3xe2x80x9310 more efficient compared to the typical results of heterogeneous continuous-flow hydrogenations."},{"question":"Help me port this code over to C#:from collections import Counterdef custom_order(s):    char_freq = Counter(s)    return \'\'.join(sorted(s, key=lambda char: (ord(char.lower()), -char_freq[char], len(char))))def anti_jumble(s):    return \' \'.join(custom_order(word) for word in s.split(\' \'))","answer":"Here is the equivalent C# code implementing the two functions:```CSharpusing System;using System.Linq;using System.Collections.Generic;public class Program{    static void Main()    {        Console.WriteLine(AntiJumble(\\"Test String\\"));    }    public static string CustomOrder(string s)    {        var charFreq = s.GroupBy(c => c.ToString(), StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase)                        .ToDictionary(g => g.Key, g => g.Count(), StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);        return string.Concat(s.OrderBy(c => c.ToString(), StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase)                               .ThenByDescending(c => charFreq[c.ToString()])                               .ThenBy(c => c.ToString().Length));    }    public static string AntiJumble(string s)    {        return string.Join(\\" \\", s.Split(\' \').Select(word => CustomOrder(word)));    }}```This code imports the necessary libraries, defines the `CustomOrder` and `AntiJumble` functions, then uses these functions to sort string in a custom order.

However, I can provide you the pseudocode for a recursive implementation of binary search algorithm and explain how it works.Here\'s a generic pseudocode for binary search:```FUNCTION BinarySearch(Array, target, start, end) IS    IF end < start THEN        RETURN \\"Not Found\\"    END IF    mid = (start + end) / 2     IF Array[mid] > target THEN        RETURN BinarySearch(Array, target, start, mid - 1)     ELSE IF Array[mid] < target THEN        RETURN BinarySearch(Array, target, mid + 1, end)    ELSE         RETURN mid     END IFENDFUNCTION```This code works by taking an array and a target value as input. It also takes two indices, signaling the start and end of the part of the array to be searched. Initially, these are usually set to the indices of the first and last element of the array. The search is done by continually dividing the array in two, hence the term \'binary\' in the name. If the target is less than the middle element, the algorithm is carried out recursively on the left half of the array; if it\'s more, it\'s carried out on the right half. If an element equal to the target is found, its index is returned. If the part of the array to be searched becomes empty (i.e., end is less than start), the function returns \\"Not Found\\".The binary search algorithm is highly efficient because it splits the search space in half after each comparison. Its time complexity is O(log N), where N is the size of the binary search tree. This is a significant enhancement over other algorithms such as linear search, which has a time complexity of O(N)."},{"question":"In the sphere of managing a Hadoop operation within my distributed computation architecture, I am grappling with a substantial obstacle known as \'Data Skew\'.

This should include a thorough, rational analysis of the issue, identifying the primary source, and suggesting a preventative approach against similar problems in future situations. Moreover, could you explore the possible consequences of different Hadoop versions and the contribution of supplementary libraries in this stalemate, while also considering the interaction between these components? Could you also assess the potential influence of this skew on the overall speed and effectiveness of the Hadoop process, and the viable correction methods?

Additionally, could you examine the potential effects of this issue on the overall data reliability and the likely strategies to maintain data consistency and precision?","answer":"To answer your multifaceted question, we first need to address data skew as it levers a substantial impact on Hadoop\'s performance.Data skew means that the quantity of data is not evenly distributed among the tasks. This imbalance causes a slowdown in the entire operation as some tasks take longer due to a larger workload, causing other tasks to wait. In Hadoop, this scenario leads to the problem of stragglers, or slower tasks that delay the entire processing time.The source of data skew usually stems from how the data is partitioned. Non-optimal partitioning can directly lead to this imbalance in data distribution. Hadoop, by default, tries to partition data in an evenly balanced manner; however, this may not always be possible due to the inherent nature of the data.One of the preventive approaches is to implement a good partitioning strategy that ensures data is as evenly distributed as possible. This can involve creating custom partitioning functions that understand the nature of your data.Different Hadoop versions and supplementary tools can impact data skew. For instance, Hadoop 2 brought about improvements in resource management, job scheduling, and cluster sharedness which can alleviate the data skew issue. Tools like Apache Flink, Spark, and Tez often come with configuration parameters that can help manage data skew.One of the major impacts of data skew is a slowdown in processing time. In extreme cases, your application may hang or even crash. To correct this, after implementing a better partitioning strategy, you may need to scale up your cluster resources or re-design your application to better handle the data distribution.HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) can indeed play a significant role in this issue. HDFS uses a block structure to store data where data is divided into fixed-size blocks (default size being 64 MB or 128 MB). If the blocks are not filled, this may result in a waste of space and resources. The way data is stored in HDFS doesn’t directly cause skew, however, uneven data distribution across different nodes may provoke such issues.Data skew can potentially impact data reliability too. In case of machine failures, it might cause data loss or inconsistencies if the failed machine was handling a larger chunk of data. To maintain data consistency, one common practice is to use replication in HDFS. In conclusion, handling data skew is crucial for optimal Hadoop operation. This can be adjusted by maintaining a good partitioning strategy, effectively using the Hadoop version and other tools, and managing HDFS in a way that promotes even data distribution."},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) overactivity has also been described in metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity, conditions shared by women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) We hypothesized that RAS overactivity may be present in PCOS. Methods: We determined plasma levels of RAS-related proteins in a cohort of age matched control women (n = 97) and women with PCOS (n = 146). Plasma levels of RAS-related proteins (ACE2, Renin and Angiotensinogen (AGT)) were determined by Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SOMA)-scan plasma protein measurement. Results: PCOS women had a higher BMI (p < 0.001), systolic (p < 0.0001) and diastolic (p < 0.05) blood pressure, waist circumference (p < 0.0001), testosterone (p < 0.0001), free androgen index (p < 0.0001) and CRP (p < 0.0001). Renin was elevated in PCOS (p < 0.05) and angiotensinogen was lower in PCOS (p < 0.05), indicating overactivity of the RAS system in PCOS. ACE2 levels were lower in PCOS (p < 0.05), suggesting that PCOS women are at risk for development of hypertension.

Greatest common divisor is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers without a remainder. We can also use a python code to find the greatest common divisor.The python code is following:```pythonimport math#initialize the numbersnum1 = 96num2 = 216#use math.gcd() methodgcd = math.gcd(num1, num2)print(\\"The simplified form of the given fraction is \\", num1//gcd, \\"/\\", num2//gcd)```Upon running this code, you should get the output as: \\"The simplified form of the given fraction is 4 / 9\\".

Unfortunately, directly merging PDF files is not natively supported in Google Apps Script, but you can use third-party tools online such as Smallpdf or Adobe Tools after obtaining the PDF files on Drive.Here is a sample script on how to convert your Google Docs files into PDF:```javascriptfunction createPDF() {  var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();  var sheet = ss.getSheetByName(\\"Sheet1\\"); // specify the sheet name  var data = sheet.getRange(\\"D3:D\\" + sheet.getLastRow()).getValues();     for(var i = 0; i < data.length; i++){    if(data[i][0] != \'\') { // if column D is not empty      var id = data[i][0];            // Open the Google Doc that correspond to the ID on column D      var doc = DocumentApp.openById(id);           // Save a temp PDF version of the Doc        var blob = DriveApp.getFileById(id).getAs(\\"application/pdf\\");      var file = DriveApp.createFile(blob);      Logger.log(\\"Created PDF: \\" + file.getUrl());    }  }}```This script will create a PDF version of the Google Docs specified by the IDs on your ID_list_Google_doc array on column D and saves it to the root of your Google Drive account.This is not the final step, as you asked to combine these individual PDFs into a single PDF document. Unfortunately, as said earlier, Google Apps Script does not natively support this kind of operation. However, here\'s a workaround:1. Run this above function to generate the individual PDFs file from your Google Docs templates.2. After all PDF files are created on your Drive, download these files.3.

The `is_prime` helper function checks if a number is prime or not by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility. The `prime_indices` list comprehension finds all the prime indices in the range of the length of the input list. Then, the `res_list` list comprehension iterates over the prime indices and extracts the number at that index in the input list if it is prime, else it adds 0 to the result list. Note that for larger lists, it\'s better to use more optimized algorithm to check prime numbers such as Sieve of Eratosthenes, but here we use simple approach for clarity.Also, the function does not verify strict prime at prime indices, as this would be extremely inefficient on bigger lists. Instead, it just replaces non-prime numbers at prime indices with zeros for output. If you want to strictly enforce the condition and discard the list if it doesn\'t fully comply, you can return some specific error message or flag in the `res_list` comprehension."},{"question":"Design and implement an efficient data structure to represent a specific kind of tree.

One is a prime number p where p+2 is also a prime number (also known as twin primes). The other is a composite number m where m+2 is the product of the same number of distinct prime numbers.Because the limit is 10^6, we only have to check up to this number. We can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all primes up to this limit. Then it is a simple matter of counting the prime factors.For the twin primes, both primes will have 1 prime factor (themselves). For the composite numbers, since the numbers are close (m and m+2), it is likely that they share a lot in common in terms of their prime factorizations. It simply requires some way to factor the numbers.To make things easier, we can generate a prime factorization array using a similar method as the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Instead of marking numbers as composite, we will increment the value at the number\'s index every time we find a factor. This will give us the number of prime factors for all numbers up to our limit.Python code:```pythondef prime_factors(n):    # Initialize array for prime factor count    prime_fac_count = [0] * (n + 1)    for i in range(2, n+1):        # If the number is prime, it will still have a 0 count        if prime_fac_count[i] == 0:            # Mark multiples of the prime number            for j in range(i, n+1, i):                prime_fac_count[j] += 1    return prime_fac_countdef count_same_prime_factors(n):    prime_fac_count = prime_factors(n)    count = 0    for i in range(2, n-1):        if prime_fac_count[i] == prime_fac_count[i+2]:            count += 1    return countprint(count_same_prime_factors(106))```In this code, `prime_factors()` function populates an array with the count of prime factors for each number up to `n`. We do this by looping from 2 up to `n`, and for each `i`, if it hasn\'t been incremented yet, it\'s a prime number so we start another loop that increments every `i`th index.The `count_same_prime_factors()` function loops through `prime_fac_count` and increments a counter every time the count for `i` is equal to the count for `i+2`.

Make sure to handle corner cases properly.","answer":"Here is how a slightly more complex question can be tackled:We have now introduced a new requirement - the order of the elements in the modified list should be the same as the order in which their original indices appear in the sequence of integers from 0 to len(l) - 1 which are divisible by n or m.First let\'s discuss the expected behavior caused by this additional complexity:1. The condition \\"indices divisible by n or m\\" changes the problem significantly. If both n and m divide the same index, the function should multiply that number by its index only once.2. The order of the elements in the new list should be kept the same as their original indices.3. Indices start at 0, so we need to consider this. If n or m is 0, it could cause divide by zero error.Here\'s the corrected `complex_sort` function:```pythondef complex_sort(l: list, n: int, m: int):    new_list = [0] * len(l)    sorted_indices = sorted([i for i in range(len(l)) if i % n == 0 or i % m == 0], reverse=True)    for i in sorted_indices:        new_list[i] = l[i] * i    return new_list```You can test this function with the given test cases:```pythonprint(complex_sort([1, 2, 3], 2, 3))  # Expected output: [0, 2, 0]print(complex_sort([5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], 3, 2))  # Expected output: [0, 12, 0, 24, 0, 50, 0]print(complex_sort([8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 3, 2))  # Expected output: [0, 7, 0, 15, 0, 15, 0, 7]```In this modified version of `complex_sort`, the function not only does the sort but also keeps track of the original order of the elements which have been modified (multiplication with indices). Furthermore, corner cases such as `n` or `m` being 0 are also handled correctly."},{"question":"Develop a Python script capable of transposing a string of textual data into its equivalent Morse code representation.Input string: Hello","answer":"To create a script that transcribes textual data to Morse Code, we first define a dictionary where keys are the letters in English alphabet and values are the corresponding Morse Code. The Morse Code conversion rules follow a set pattern where space (\' \') is used as a separation between letters and a slash (\'/\') is used as a separation between words. Consider the sample Python script below:```python# Define dictionary MAP for Morse CodeMORSE_CODE_DICT = { \'A\':\'.-\', \'B\':\'-...\',                    \'C\':\'-.-.\', \'D\':\'-..\', \'E\':\'.\',                    \'F\':\'..-.\', \'G\':\'--.\', \'H\':\'....\',                    \'I\':\'..\', \'J\':\'.---\', \'K\':\'-.-\',                    \'L\':\'.-..\', \'M\':\'--\', \'N\':\'-.\',                    \'O\':\'---\', \'P\':\'.--.\', \'Q\':\'--.-\',                    \'R\':\'.-.\', \'S\':\'...\', \'T\':\'-\',                    \'U\':\'..-\', \'V\':\'...-\', \'W\':\'.--\',                    \'X\':\'-..-\', \'Y\':\'-.--\', \'Z\':\'--..\'}def string_to_morse(input_string):    # Create an empty string to hold Morse Code    morse_code = \'\'    for char in input_string.upper():        if char != \\" \\":            # Get Morse code of character and add a space            morse_code += MORSE_CODE_DICT[char] + \' \'        else:            # Add a / in Morse code to represent a space            morse_code += \'/ \'    return morse_codeprint(string_to_morse(\\"Hello\\"))```In the script above, the \\"string_to_morse\\" function runs a for-each loop over all the characters in the \\"input_string\\". It retrieves the equivalent Morse code for each character lookup by uppercase character from the \\"MORSE_CODE_DICT\\" dictionary.

However, please note that this is not specific to static classes, it will also return true for non-static classes.So your check would look something like this:```phpif(class_exists(\'bob\')) {    bob::yippie();}```This code will tell PHP to only call bob::yippie() if a class named bob exists.However, please take into account that in PHP, a class is not declared as static, only class properties and methods can be static. This means that a class with a static method would look something like this:```phpclass bob {    public static function yippie() {        echo \\"skippie\\";    }}```In this case, you can use method_exists() to check if the specific static method exists in the class:```phpif(class_exists(\'bob\') && method_exists(\'bob\', \'yippie\')) {    bob::yippie();}```This code will execute bob::yippie() only if a class named bob exists and it has a method named yippie."},{"question":"I am new to Machine Learning.I want to know if there is any indicator which can show us ML\'s confidence about any given prediction.I am suppose to build an application in which I only want to use predictions which are 100% right...anything less than that, I want to ignore those predictions.Please let me know.","answer":"Machine learning models (in fact, no predictive models at all) cannot provide 100% accurate predictions all the time. Machine learning models are probabilistic and are hence always associated with some amount of uncertainty.However, some machine learning models are capable of outputting a confidence score in addition to the prediction. This score essentially indicates the confidence that the algorithm has in its prediction. For example, a model may output a prediction of \\"dog\\" with a confidence score of 0.95, which means that the model is 95% confident that the given input is a dog.In many binary classification models, the confidence score represents the probability of a given instance belonging to the positive class. For example, in a logistic regression model that predicts whether a person is a smoker or non-smoker, a higher score indicates a higher probability the person is a smoker.The method of obtaining this confidence score can differ between algorithms. In the case of decision trees for binary classification, the confidence score is calculated as the proportion of training instances of the same class in that leaf node. In some models, these scores can be obtained directly, such as \\"predict_proba\\" function in Scikit-learn models.For models that do not directly provide a confidence score, one option is to use a technique called bootstrapping to create multiple models and then measure the variability in the predictions.Remember, you can set a threshold on this confidence score to only take into account predictions that are above a certain level of confidence. However, setting this to 100% may mean that very few or no predictions are used, as it is very rare for a model to be 100% confident about a prediction.Also keep in mind that these confidence scores are not a guarantee of accuracy, they only give an indication of the model\'s certainty - it could be 95% confident and still be wrong. Model\'s accuracy should be validated using a held-out test set."},{"question":"Can you use windows hooks or other methods to do code injection with c#? I\'ve seen lots of things about code injection but all of them are done in C/C++. I don\'t know either of those languages and have a really hard time translating. Does anyone have any ideas on how to do this?","answer":"While it is technically possible to perform code injection techniques using C#, it\'s important to note upfront that this kind of operation carries very significant ethical and legal risks. Any unauthorized modification or interaction with another program\'s code is highly advised against. Even if you\'re performing these operations for the purpose of software security testing or penetration testing, it should only be done with express permission and on software owned/architected by you or your organization. Unauthorized code injection can be in breach of the Computer Misuse Act or various other international laws and can lead to serious penalties, including imprisonment.Here\'s an example about how you could theoretically use C# to perform code injection, again not advocating for unauthorized or unethical use. This example uses the Windows API to inject arbitrary code into a running process:```csharpusing System;using System.Diagnostics;using System.Runtime.InteropServices;namespace CodeInjection{    class Program    {        [DllImport(\\"kernel32.dll\\", SetLastError = true)]        static extern IntPtr OpenProcess(uint processAccess, bool bInheritHandle, int processId);        [DllImport(\\"kernel32.dll\\", SetLastError = true)]        static extern IntPtr VirtualAllocEx(IntPtr hProcess, IntPtr lpAddress, uint dwSize, uint flAllocationType, uint flProtect);        [DllImport(\\"kernel32.dll\\", SetLastError = true)]        static extern int WriteProcessMemory(IntPtr hProcess, IntPtr lpBaseAddress, byte[] buffer, uint size, int lpNumberOfBytesWritten);        const int PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS = 0x1F0FFF;        const int MEM_COMMIT = 0x1000;        const int MEM_RESERVE = 0x2000;        const int PAGE_READWRITE = 4;        static void Main(string[] args)        {            Process[] myProcess = Process.GetProcessesByName(\\"TARGET PROCESS NAME\\");            IntPtr processHandle = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, false, myProcess[0].Id);            IntPtr address = VirtualAllocEx(processHandle, IntPtr.Zero, 0x1000, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_READWRITE);            byte[] buffer = new byte[1];            buffer[0] = 0; // your byte code here                       WriteProcessMemory(processHandle, address, buffer, (uint)buffer.Length, 0);        }    }}```This example will open the running process, allocate memory and then write to that memory. Replacing `\\"TARGET PROCESS NAME\\"` with the name of your running process and adding your payload to the buffer variable will allow this program to inject your code into the target process.Again as a disclaimer, this should only be used in contexts where you have full legal and ethical rights to perform such operations. Unauthorized code injection is illegal and unethical, and this example is provided for informational and potentially academic purposes, not as advocacy for illegitimate activities."},{"question":"In the context of developing and maintaining a web application predominantly constructed with Python, I am contemplating the adoption of Amazon Web Services\' DynamoDB. Could you conduct an exhaustive analysis of the distinct benefits and potential competitive edge this approach might offer, particularly focusing on aspects like scalability, cost-effectiveness, and seamless integration? Additionally, could you also consider the implications of this strategy on the overall performance and security of the application?","answer":"Amazon DynamoDB has carved a niche for itself in the tech ecosystem by consolidating its position as a fully-managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. The lucrativeness of DynamoDB lies in its proficiency to scale tables to handle more than 10 trillion requests per day and support peaks of more than 20 million requests per second.Here is a deeper dive into your concerns:1. Scalability: DynamoDB serves well in applications that need to scale beyond the capabilities of traditional SQL databases. As a managed service, it automatically handles tasks like patching, backup, and data replication, eliminating much of the administrative burden tied to scale. You can easily scale up or down to meet demand, and you will not have to worry about provisioning or managing servers.2. Cost-effectiveness: DynamoDB runs on an on-demand capacity mode, meaning you only pay for the reads and writes your app performs. Eliminating server maintenance and management significantly reduces operational overhead and costs. And with DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX), users can create in-memory caches for more read-intensive workloads, which can further drive down costs.3. Seamless Integration: DynamoDB integrates well with other core AWS services like Lambda, Data Pipeline, EMR, and even allows real-time data processing via Kinesis. It also syncs well with AWS IAM for access control, making it easier to knit together with your Python web application.4. Performance: For any application, performance is paramount and DynamoDB, with single-digit millisecond latency, ensures high-performance at any scale. With global tables features and the inbuild DAX, it provides fast, fully managed, in-memory caching that reduces response times from milliseconds to microseconds, even at millions of requests per second.5. Security: DynamoDB integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), allowing policy-based permissions, meaning the developer has granular control over who can access which DynamoDB resources. Furthermore, DynamoDB provides encryption at rest, giving an added layer of data protection. Cons: Despite its many benefits, DynamoDB does require a bit of knowledge to use effectively, especially with complex queries. Also, like any managed service, there might be limitations or trade-offs compared to managing your own database on an EC2 instance.However, given its impressive package of scalability, performance, and security features — besides its cost-effectiveness and seamless integration abilities — I believe DynamoDB could prove to be a value addition to your Python web application. It allows you to keep focus on your application logic rather than dedicating time and resources to database management and optimization."},{"question":"Create a script using TensorFlow\'s Keras library to train a multi-task transformer model for both sentiment analysis and text summarization task on a large-scale and multilingual dataset.

Clinical, genetic and immunologic studies in a large kindred. The discovery of a large kindred with a heritable deficiency of the fifth component of complement (C5) has permitted the accumulation of new clinical, genetic and immunologic data concerning the role of C5 in human subjects. The proband, who has had nine episodes of disseminated gonococcal infection, has a hemolytic C5 level of approximately 0. 5 per cent of normal. No C5 protein was detectable, but low levels of functional C5 activity could be found using a sensitive bactericidal assay. The probands twin as well as another sister also had extremely low levels of hemolytic C5 (approximately 0. 5 per cent normal), but both these subjects have been healthy. Hemolytic complement and bacteriolytic activity could be restored by the addition of purified C5. No chemotactic activity for polymorphonuclear leukocytes could be generated in the C5-deficient serums upon activation of either the classic or alternative pathways, again demonstrating the importance of C5 in human subjects for the production of chemotactic factors. The chemotactic responsiveness of the patients polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes to preformed chemotactic factors was not depressed. Twenty-two of 32 other family members from three generations had depressed whole hemolytic complement levels. In 19 of 30 family members, levels of hemolytic C5 ranged from 13 to 64 per cent of normal. No linkage for C5 deficiency and the A or B loci of the major histocompatibility complex could be found.

MLD characteristics were examined using CBCT data in 40 subjects. A 3D Cephalometric analysis was developed to describe the spatial position of the mandible and temporal bones. Vertical dental heights were shorter and the posterior occlusal plane (POP) presented a steeper sagittal inclination on the shifted side (the side of the laterally displaced bony chin) than on the contralateral side. (p < 0.01). The MLD was related to a superiorly inclined POP Cant in the same direction (r = 0.82; p < 0.01). The shifted side condyle was dislocated medially and was smaller. Temporal bone sagittal inclination showed a more forward and medial inclination on the contralateral side (p < 0.01). A unilateral decrease in the vertical height of the dentition and the subsequent steeper occlusal plane inclinations correlated with (1) mandibular rotational displacement and condylar lateral displacement, (2) mandibular and condylar morphologic changes (3) changes in temporal bone position.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"temporal bones\\", \\"mandibular lateral displacement\\", \\"MLD\\", \\"dentition\\", \\"Temporal bone\\", \\"temporal bone\\", \\"condylar\\", \\"mandible\\", \\"mandibular rotational displacement\\", \\"mandibular\\", \\"condyle\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"POP\\", \\"malocclusions\\", \\"posterior occlusal plane\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [\\"POP Cant\\"], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"superiorly inclined\\", \\"laterally displaced bony chin\\", \\"medial inclination\\", \\"sagittal inclination\\", \\"occlusal plane inclinations\\", \\"Vertical dental heights were shorter\\", \\"decrease in the vertical height\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"3D imaging\\", \\"cone-beam computed tomography\\", \\"Cephalometric analysis\\", \\"CBCT\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [\\"dislocated\\"], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"subjects\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"study\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"spatial position\\", \\"position\\", \\"Three-dimensional\\", \\"contralateral side\\", \\"3D\\", \\"unilateral\\", \\"morphological\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Recent studies show that the elderly have increased oxidative stress and impaired antioxidant defense systems . Our study aims to evaluate the effects of daily consumption of EVOO in the healthy institutionalized elderly . We studied anthropometric , biochemical and antioxidant parameters in 62 subjects aged 65-96 years after a 6-week daily intake of polyphenol-rich EVOO with high oleuropein derivative contents . Subjects were divided into a control group ( CG ) who maintained their dietary habits ( n=39 ) and an olive group ( OG ) who consumed EVOO as the only added fat , plus a daily dose of 50ml ( n=23 ) . We found a significant reduction of total cholesterol ( TC ) , HDL , LDL and TGs in OG subjects and a significant increase of HDL levels . There was no significant variation in the CG parameters . In OG the total antioxidant capacity ( TAC ) in plasma increased with significant differences over CG . Plasma hydroxytyrosol ( OH-Tyr ) concentration showed a significant increase after EVOO intervention . Daily consumption of EVOO was found to have positive effects on lipid profiles , OH-Tyr levels and TAC .

It represents an instantiation of the one sense per collocation observation (Gale et al., 1992). Like most existing approaches it utilizes clustering of word co-occurrences. This approach differs from other approaches to WSI in that it enhances the effect of the one sense per collocation observation by using triplets of words instead of pairs. The combination with a two-step clustering process using sentence co-occurrences as features allows for accurate results. Additionally, a novel and likewise automatic and unsupervised evaluation method inspired by Schutze \'s (1992) idea of evaluation of word sense disambiguation algorithms is employed. Offering advantages like reproducability and independency of a given biased gold standard it also enables automatic parameter optimization of the WSI algorithm.","answer":"[[\\"triplets of words\\", \\"solution\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"clustering of word co-occurrences\\", \\"solution\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"solution\\", \\"one sense per collocation observation\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"solution\\", \\"automatic and unsupervised word sense induction (WSI)\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"sentence co-occurrences\\", \\"two-step clustering process\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"automatic and unsupervised evaluation method\\", \\"word sense disambiguation algorithms\\", \\"EVALUATE-FOR\\"], [\\"solution\\", \\"one sense per collocation observation\\", \\"HYPONYM-OF\\"], [\\"solution\\", \\"approaches\\", \\"COMPARE\\"], [\\"approaches\\", \\"automatic and unsupervised word sense induction (WSI)\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"], [\\"automatic parameter optimization\\", \\"word sense disambiguation algorithms\\", \\"USED-FOR\\"]]"},{"question":"You are provided with a research question, keyphrases about the question, a description of candidate datasets and dataset options.

Surprisingly I was not able to even figure out, if it is possible at all. Maybe it is too common.","answer":"Yes, it is possible to achieve this using Alexa skill. First, you need to set an interaction model for your Alexa skill to handle dialogue between the user and the device. An interaction model defines all of the intents (or actions) that can be performed via your Alexa skill.Next, you will need to use the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) software development kit (SDK). This kit provides libraries, code samples, and documentation to assist you in developing your Alexa skill.One component of ASK that you would likely use is the Request and Response interfaces, which handle back-and-forth communication between your skill and a user, and allow for the exchange of information.Amazon suggests using session attributes to manage dialogue state, which can be set in the handle method of your ASK SDK. Session attributes make it easy to store and pass information between the different intents in a user\'s dialogue model, enabling a back-and-forth conversation.Regarding the REST API, ASK SDK can make HTTP requests to external APIs to fetch or send data. So, you can fetch the actual target device information via a REST API.Sample code using Node.js SDK:```const GetRemoteDataHandler = {  canHandle(handlerInput) {    return handlerInput.requestEnvelope.request.type === \'LaunchRequest\';  },  async handle(handlerInput) {    let outputSpeech = \'This is the default message.\';    await getRemoteData(\'http://api.example.com/data\')      .then((response) => {        const data = JSON.parse(response);        outputSpeech = `The data from the API is {data.result}`;      })      .catch((err) => {        console.log(`ERROR: {err.message}`);        // set an optional error message here        // outputSpeech = \'I am sorry. I cannot get the data from the API.\';      });    return handlerInput.responseBuilder      .speak(outputSpeech)      .getResponse();  },};const getRemoteData = (url) => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {  const client = url.startsWith(\'https\') ? require(\'https\') : require(\'http\');  const request = client.get(url, (response) => {    if (response.statusCode < 200 || response.statusCode > 299) {      reject(new Error(\'Failed with status code: \' + response.statusCode));    }    const body = [];    response.on(\'data\', (chunk) => body.push(chunk));    response.on(\'end\', () => resolve(body.join(\'\')));  });  request.on(\'error\', (err) => reject(err))})```This code is a simple example of fetching data from remote API and then Alexandra will speak the data.Note that, don\'t forget to grant permissions in your Alexa Skill settings since you are making remote HTTP/HTTPS network requests."},{"question":"Is it possible to have a fixture change between test methods?

This ensures that the state of the test environment is predictable and consistent. However, changing the fixture \\"shape\\" between tests is generally discouraged because it threatens the integrity of the tests. One of the principles of efficient testing is that tests are autonomous. They should not depend on one another, and each test should be able to run independently. If you change the structure of your fixtures in between tests, you are creating dependencies, which will make your tests unreliable and difficult to maintain.Even if your testing framework allowed you to modify the shape of your fixtures dynamically (and most don\'t, for good reason), you wouldn\'t necessarily want to do this.I would suggest you instead consider the following alternatives:1. Create separate sets of fixtures for different tests. You can organize your test methods into different test classes, each with its own set of appropriate fixtures.2. Write a utility method to generate your fixture data on demand. This method could take parameters describing how you want your fixtures to look, and return a set of fixtures according to these specifications. This method could be called in the set-up method of your test class, or even at the start of individual test methods.3. It’s not very efficient and may be overkill, but if you really do need to completely redefine your data structures between tests, you could use a tool like Faker or FactoryMuffin to set up custom fixture data in your set-up method.It is usually better to have repetitive fixtures than to have unpredictable tests. The mantra of testing is: isolate, isolate, isolate. Even if it means more upfront work, it\'s the only way to write reliable, maintainable tests."},{"question":"Your task involves engineering a software component in the Python programming language, specifically designed to calculate and render the absolute measure of the discrepancy existing between two distinctive numerical entities, 15 and 10.","answer":"Here is a basic python program to solve this task:```pythondef absolute_discrepancy(num1, num2):    return abs(num1 - num2)print(absolute_discrepancy(15, 10))```This code defines a function `absolute_discrepancy` that takes two arguments, `num1` and `num2`, and returns their absolute difference.

Could you also ascertain the function of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) in this deadlock, and how its configuration might instigate the surfacing of such issues, while also pondering the potential effects of data distribution and storage strategies? In addition, could you scrutinize the potential repercussions of this problem on the overall data reliability and the probable strategies to uphold data consistency and accuracy?","answer":"Data skew in the context of Hadoop operation refers to a scenario where data is not evenly distributed across nodes, resulting in uneven workloads, poor performance, and inefficiency. This issue emanates from the basic fact that Hadoop, particularly MapReduce algorithm, is designed to work best when data are evenly distributed.In regard to batch processing, the problem of data skew can directly impact on the map function and reduce function. For MapReduce operation, all map tasks should finish their work to proceed to reduce tasks. If data skew exists, one or more tasks will take longer to complete than others, keeping the entire system idle. This results in the reduction of processing speed and overall efficiency. To mitigate against data skew, strategies such as \'sampling the data\' can be used to gain insights into the data distribution and balance the workload accordingly. Also, implementing a logical partitioning strategy is essential to avoid the concentration of a large portion of data in one particular node.Management and configuration of HDFS play a significant role in managing data skew. An unbalanced HDFS will lead to an increase in data skew. Therefore, configuring HDFS to ensure balanced data distribution is paramount. Techniques such as data replication and the right choice of block size can help in improving the data distribution and improving data processing speed.Varying Hadoop versions also have a role to play. Newer versions come with better mitigation strategies against data skew. Therefore, keeping the Hadoop version updated is another way to prevent such issues.Additionally, the role of auxiliary libraries is pertinent in this deadlock. Libraries like Hive and Pig have inbuilt strategies to optimize for skew, including skew join optimizations in Hive and skewed keys in Pig. Data skew can have repercussions on data reliability and accuracy. It may result in \'hotspotting\' where certain nodes get overwhelmed with read/write operations while others remain idle, leading to an increased potential for failure. Strategies to maintain data consistency and accuracy include enforcing a proper data partitioning strategy as well as using techniques like checksums and write-ahead logs to catch any discrepancies.In all, managing data skew in a distributed computation framework utilizing Hadoop involves understanding the nature of your data and utilizing the right partitioning strategies, configuring the HDFS to ensure balanced data distribution, proper use of ancillary libraries, and always keeping the Hadoop version updated."},{"question":"I have simple code on golang which is executed while receive request and update a value on database.res := db.Where(ExampleStructforDB{Id: Id}).FirstOrCreate(&ls)    if res.Error != nil {        log.Error(res.Error)        return res.Error    }ls.count += 1err = Db.Save(&ls).Errorif err != nil {    log.Error(err)    return err}Sometimes I see that there is a race condition.Time-to-time some of the requests gets same value from database for updating.But in fact that, every request is increase or decrease count on db.As far as I understand, GORM says that it should be use `Session`.[https://gorm.io/docs/session.html](https://gorm.io/docs/session.html)Is it right approach for it ?","answer":"Yes, your understanding is correct. `Session` in GORM provides a quite similar mechanism as database transactions. To avoid race conditions and ensure the data consistency, using `Session` can be a suitable approach, especially when dealing with multiple relational data manipulation.Your code logic could be wrapped into a single `Session` which ensures that all operations are executed atomically. If error occurs, the whole block of operations are rolled back, hence data consistency is kept.Below is an example of how you can use `Session`:```gosess := db.Session(&gorm.Session{NewDB: true})err := sess.Transaction(func(tx *gorm.DB) error {    var ls *ExampleStructforDB    res := tx.Where(ExampleStructforDB{Id: Id}).FirstOrCreate(&ls)    if res.Error != nil {        return res.Error   // rollback, return the error    }    ls.count += 1    return tx.Save(&ls).Error // commit})if err != nil {    log.Error(err)    return err}```In the above snippet, `Transaction` method starts a session, then call a function to perform SQL transactions. If the function returns an error, the session would rollback; otherwise, it commits automatically.This ensures that all the operations within the function are executed together. If any of them fails, all would be cancelled, and the updated count value in the database remains consistent with the number of successful requests. But please notice that, this would also increase the system load a bit since all involved records are locked during the transaction, which might lead to performance drop if the system has very high concurrent requirements.

However, this can give you a general idea of how you could structure such a program in a high-level language, like Python. Note that an actual implementation on an Android smartphone would need to be written in a language/framework compatible with Android, like Java/Kotlin with Android Studio:Here\'s a broad, simplified outline:1. Gather Biometric Data: You\'d need to access Android\'s BiometricPrompt API, or similar, to collect biometric data (like fingerprint scans or facial recognition). 2. Systematize: After obtaining the raw data, you would need to create algorithms to process and organize it. This could be as simple as associating each piece of biometric data with the time it was recorded and storing it in a list. At a higher level, you might use machine learning techniques to recognize patterns.3. Manage Data: This data would then need to be stored. On Android, this would likely involve using the Android SQLite database.4. Strategic Reasoning: Based on the specifications given, it is not clear what this might involve. It might refer to some kind of decision making based on the trends recognized in the biometric data. Without more specifics, it\'s hard to say what this step might look like.Here\'s a very basic idea of how this process might work:```pythonclass BiometricDataGatherer:    def gather_data(self):        pass  # replace with code to gather dataclass BiometricDataSystematizer:    def systematize(self, data):        pass  # replace with code to systemize dataclass BiometricDataManager:    def store(self, systematized_data):        pass  # replace with code to store dataclass StrategicReasoner:    def reason(self, systematized_data):        pass  # replace with code to use data strategicallygatherer = BiometricDataGatherer()systematizer = BiometricDataSystematizer()manager = BiometricDataManager()reasoner = StrategicReasoner()data = gatherer.gather_data()systematized_data = systematizer.systematize(data)manager.store(systematized_data)reasoner.reason(systematized_data)```  In this pseudocode, each of the classes would need to be filled out to perform their respective tasks.

Please compare to recycling an app pool and stopping and starting an ASP.NET web site.If you replace a DLL or edit/replace the web.config on an ASP.NET web site is that the same as stopping and starting that web site?","answer":"IIS Reset is a command line tool that restarts the Internet Information Services (IIS) as well as all its associated services such as SMTP, NNTP, and FTP. This is advantageous when you want all changes to be applied immediately; however, this also means that internet services will be temporarily unavailable to users.On the other hand, recycling an app pool is specific to a particular application pool and does not affect other app pools running to other sites. This is more efficient as it only reloads the specific application pool rather than all the app pools, providing minimal disruption to users.Stopping and starting an ASP.NET website is another way of applying updates or changes to a website, and it only affects the specific website which is stopped and started, not the whole server. Hence, it\'s less disruptive than an IIS Reset but more disruptive than app pool recycling since it stops the entire site.Finally, when you replace a DLL or edit/replace the web.config on an ASP.NET website, it does automatically force a restart of the app domain, which is similar to an app pool recycle or stopping and starting that web site.

SVGs are essentially text files that describe lines, curves, shapes, colors, and text. As such, they can infinitely scale (be resized up or down) without losing quality, making them essential for responsive web design.When it comes to performance, SVGs often have smaller file sizes than their raster image counterparts. This isn\'t always the case, especially with more complex images, but for icons and simple graphics, they\'re typically more lightweight. SVGs are also easy to animate and modify with CSS or JavaScript directly in the browser, offering more scope for interactive design enhancements without the need for additional HTTP requests.For accessibility, ensure all SVG icons are described with `<title>` and `<description>` elements, and use `aria-hidden=\\"true\\"` if they\'re purely decorative.Regarding CSS, you can simply apply a CSS rule declaring a `fill` property to dynamically alter the color of the SVG icon:```csssvg {  fill: #ff0000;}```Animating SVGs can be done with just CSS and HTML (for simpler animations) or with JavaScript libraries like <a href=\\"https://www.cheezyburritostv.com/\\">Snap.svg</a> and <a href=\\"https://www.dieforcovid.com/\\">GSAP</a> for more complex or interactive animations.For larger, more complex SVGs and animations that can\'t be kept \'inline\', consider optimizing SVGs for performance by minimizing the file size, lazy-loading, and gzipping. SVGs can be compressed well and served quickly due to their textual nature, while still retaining image quality. SVGOMG is a useful tool for optimizing SVGs, and gzip can further reduce the SVG file size by up to 60-80%.In spite of its numerous advantages, SVGs have some potential challenges:1. Cross-browser compatibility: Although most modern browsers have excellent support for SVGs, older versions may have lacking or inconsistent support.2. Complexity: Complex images may result in larger SVG file sizes compared to GIF or JPEG formats.These challenges can be mitigated by using feature detection techniques, like Modernizr, and falling back to PNG images for older browsers, and by keeping SVG graphics as simple as possible or considering other formats for highly complex images."},{"question":"I\'m looking for a bit more background on a question that came up here: Our traders use some sort of Longstaff-Schwartz to calculate the optimal point when to call an issuer-callable bond.My question is: Does anyone know whether a) it\' s possible and b) how to exactly locate the optimal exercise point by systematically varying the autocall-level of an autocallable bond?

It deals with the issue of optimal stopping / early exercise, which is relevant in American options, by using a least squares method to estimate the future expected payoff of continuation and then comparing it with the immediate payoff from exercising the option.On Issuer-callable and Autocallable Bonds: Issuer-callable bonds give the issuer the right but not the obligation to repurchase the bonds before maturity at a defined call price. It provides the issuer with flexibility, e.g., if interest rates fall after issuance, the issuer can call back the bond and reissue a new bond at a lower interest rate. Autocallable bonds, on the other hand, automatically redeem (autocall) prior to maturity once the price of the underlying security reaches a certain level. Both of these instruments can be price using Monte Carlo simulation.Now coming to your question, a) Yes, it’s theoretically possible to locate the optimal exercise point by systematically varying the autocall level of an autocallable bond. b) The method on how to do this can be quite complex and would typically involve use of numerical methods, such as a grid search or an optimization algorithm, to solve for the level that minimizes the price difference between the autocallable and issuer callable bond. A key assumption here is that both products have the same risk factors and pricing model.However, a few points to consider is that issuer callable and autocallable bonds have different characteristics. Autocallables are often dependent on the performance of an underlying asset, while issuer-callable bonds allow issuers to redeem their bonds when interest rates fall. As such, their prices don\'t necessarily have to coincide even at an optimized autocall level. The timing and probability of each callable feature being exercised can differ considerably, hence, these two instruments\' prices can behave differently under different scenarios.Moreover, an important distinction is that the autocall feature is triggered automatically when the underlying\'s price reaches the barrier, while the issuer call feature, involves a strategic decision to call and hence is less predictable.Finally, for autocallable bonds, the cashflow amounts and timing are path dependent, which makes the pricing more complex than issuer callable bonds, which just need to take into consideration the possible call dates and redemption amounts. Without all the specifics, it’s impossible to say definitively how the prices of these two types of bonds would react to changes in the autocall level, but I hope above gives some overview."},{"question":"Employ the provided numerical values to formulate an HTML list, and ensure that it is appropriately formatted to adhere to the conventional structure of HTML lists.[3, 12, 13]","answer":"Sure, here\'s a simple Python script that constructs an HTML list from an input list of numbers:```pythondef create_html_list(input_list):    list_html = \\"<ul>n\\"    for i in input_list:        list_html += \\"t<li>{}</li>n\\".format(i)    list_html += \\"</ul>\\"    return list_htmlnumbers = [3, 12, 13]html_list = create_html_list(numbers)print(html_list)```If you run this script with the provided list `[3, 12, 13]`, it will output:```html<ul>\\t<li>3</li>\\t<li>12</li>\\t<li>13</li></ul>```This is a properly formatted HTML unordered list, with each list item encapsulated in `<li>` and `</li>` tags, and the entire list enclosed within `<ul>` and `</ul>` tags.

Although the structure of the scramblase nhTMEM16 has defined the architecture of the family, it was unknown how a channel has adapted to cope with its distinct functional properties. Here we have addressed this question by the structure determination of mouse TMEM16A by cryo-electron microscopy and a complementary functional characterization. The protein shows a similar organization to nhTMEM16, except for changes at the site of catalysis. There, the conformation of transmembrane helices constituting a membrane-spanning furrow that provides a path for lipids in scramblases has changed to form an enclosed aqueous pore that is largely shielded from the membrane. Our study thus reveals the structural basis of anion conduction in a TMEM16 channel and it defines the foundation for the diverse functional behavior in the TMEM16 family.Introduction:Calcium-activated chloride channels( CaCCs) are important constituents of diverse physiological processes, ranging from epithelial chloride secretion to the control of electrical excitability in smooth muscles and neurons( Hartzell et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2012; Oh and Jung, 2016; Pedemonte and Galietta, 2014). These ligand-gated ion channels are activated upon an increase of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration as a consequence of cellular signaling events. Although CaCC function can be accomplished by unrelated protein architectures( Kane Dickson et al., 2014, Kunzelmann et al., 2009), the so far best-characterized processes are mediated by the protein TMEM16A( Caputo et al., 2008; Schroeder et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2008). TMEM16A is a member of the large TMEM16 family of membrane proteins, also known as anoctamins( Yang et al., 2008). The family is exclusively found in eukaryotes and contains 10 paralogs in mammals that all share considerable sequence homology( Milenkovic et al., 2010)( Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Although it was initially anticipated that all TMEM16 proteins would function as anion channels( Hartzell et al., 2009; Tian et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2008), it is now generally accepted that only two family members( the closely related TMEM16A and B) are ion channels( Pifferi et al., 2009; Scudieri et al., 2012), whereas most others work as lipid scramblases, which catalyze the passive and bidirectional diffusion of lipids between the two leaflets of a phospholipid bilayer( Brunner et al., 2016; Malvezzi et al., 2013; Suzuki et al., 2013, 2010; Whitlock and Hartzell, 2017, 2016). The TMEM16 family shows a new protein fold, as revealed by the structure of the fungal homologue nhTMEM16, which functions as lipid scramblase( Brunner et al., 2014). nhTMEM16 consists of structured cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal components and a transmembrane domain( TMD) containing 10 transmembrane helices. As general for the TMEM16 family, the protein is a homo-dimer( Fallah et al., 2011; Sheridan et al., 2011) with each subunit containing its own lipid translocation path located at the two opposite corners of a rhombus-shaped protein distant from the dimer interface( Brunner et al., 2014). This lipid path is formed by the ‘subunit cavity’, a membrane-spanning furrow of appropriate size to harbor a lipid headgroup. Since the subunit cavity is exposed to the membrane, it was proposed that its polar surface provides a favorable environment for lipid headgroups on their way across the membrane, whereas the fatty-acid chains remain embedded in the hydrophobic core of the bilayer( Brunner et al., 2014). In the vicinity of each subunit cavity, within the membrane-embedded domain, a conserved regulatory calcium-binding site controls the activity of the protein( Brunner et al., 2014). In light of the nhTMEM16 structure and the strong sequence conservation within the family, a central open question concerns how the TMEM16A architecture has adapted to account for its altered functional properties. Previous results suggested that the same region constituting the scrambling path also forms the ion conduction pore( Yang et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2012). However, in what way the distinct structural features of a scramblase, which allows the diffusion of a large and amphiphilic substrate, are altered in a channel that facilitates the transmembrane movement of a comparably small and charged anion, remained a matter of controversy. Here we have resolved this controversy by the structure determination of mouse TMEM16A( mTMEM16A) by cryo-electron microscopy( cryo-EM) at 6. 6 Å resolution and a complementary electrophysiological characterization of pore mutants. Our data define the general architecture of a calcium-activated chloride channel of the TMEM16 family and reveal its relationship to the majority of family members working as lipid scramblases. The protein shows a similar overall fold and dimeric organization as the lipid scramblase nhTMEM16. However, conformational rearrangements of helices lining the lipid scrambling path have sealed the subunit cavity, resulting in the formation of a protein-enclosed ion conduction pore that is for most parts shielded from the membrane but that might be partly accessible to lipids on its intracellular side.Discussion:The present study has addressed structural relationships within the TMEM16 family. Since the majority of TMEM16 proteins work as lipid scramblases, which catalyze the diffusion of lipids between the two leaflets of a bilayer, it was postulated that the few family members functioning as ion channels may have evolved from an ancestral scramblase( Whitlock and Hartzell, 2016). However, the way in which TMEM16 channels have adapted to fulfill their distinct functional task has remained unknown. The structure of mTMEM16A reported here has now resolved this question. As anticipated from the strong sequence conservation, the general architecture of each subunit is shared between both branches of the family( Figure 1B). A previous structure-based hypothesis suggested a possible subunit rearrangement in dimeric TMEM16 channels, where both subunit cavities come together to form a single enclosed pore( Brunner et al., 2014). Although this hypothesis was already refuted by recent functional investigations, which demonstrated that the protein contains two ion conduction pores that are independently activated by Ca2+( Jeng et al., 2016; Lim et al., 2016), the ultimate proof for a double barreled channel is now provided by the mTMEM16A structure, which reveals the location of two pores, each contained within a single subunit of the dimeric protein. A different proposition, referred to as the proteolipidic pore hypothesis, postulated that the ion conduction pathway in TMEM16 channels is partly composed of lipids( Whitlock and Hartzell, 2016). The authors suggested that immobilized lipid headgroups lining the membrane-exposed ion conduction pore may lower the dielectric barrier for permeating ions on their way across the lipid bilayer( Whitlock and Hartzell, 2016). Our study has also provided strong evidence against this hypothesis. Instead, the model of mTMEM16A shows that α-helical rearrangements have resulted in occlusion of the lipid pathway, while opening up a conductive pore which is largely shielded from the membrane( Figure 6 and Videos 3 and 4). The only potential access of lipids is provided on the intracellular side where the detachment of transmembrane α-helices 4 and 6 form a funnel-shaped vestibule that is exposed to the cytoplasm and the lipid bilayer( Figures 5A and 6B). The gap between both α-helices may be a relic of an ancestral scramblase, and as suggested by the observed distortion of the detergent micelle in mTMEM16A, possibly destabilizes the bilayer( Figure 1—figure supplement 4B, D). Notably, this gap is also present in nhTMEM16, where a similar effect of membrane-bending has been proposed to facilitate scramblase activity, as suggested by molecular dynamics simulations( Bethel and Grabe, 2016). In this respect, it is noteworthy that the intracellular region connecting transmembrane α-helices 4 and 5 has recently been identified to play an important role in lipid scrambling in TMEM16F and was thus assigned the term ‘scramblase domain’( Yu et al., 2015). Whereas TMEM16A itself does not facilitate lipid transport, scrambling activity was conferred to a chimeric TMEM16A protein carrying the ‘scramblase domain’ of TMEM16F( Yu et al., 2015) or the equivalent region of TMEM16E( Gyobu et al., 2015). Although these results emphasize the general role of the intracellular funnel region for lipid interactions, the altered structure of the ‘subunit cavity’, in particular the absence of a membrane-exposed polar crevice in TMEM16A, leave the mechanism of lipid scrambling in these chimeras ambiguous. 10. 7554/eLife. 26232. 022Figure 6.

The view is from within the membrane( top panels) and from the outside( bottom panels). The helices constituting the membrane accessible polar cavity in scramblases have changed their location in channels to form a protein-enclosed conduit. A and B, Permeating ions and lipid headgroups are indicated in red. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 26232. 022 The structural view of the ion conduction path in mTMEM16A consisting of a funnel-shaped intracellular vestibule that narrows to a tight pore at the extracellular part of the membrane( Figure 6A) is supported by our electrophysiology experiments. Analysis of mutants shows minimal influence of basic residues in the wide intracellular vestibule, but pronounced rectification upon similar replacements near the narrow neck of the pore. Remarkably, equivalent mutations of two of these residues( Arg 515 and Lys 645) have previously been described to alter the selectivity between different anions( Peters et al., 2015). Assuming that the imaged protein conformation resembles a conducting state, its pore structure suggests that permeating anions have to shed their hydration shell and interact with pore-lining residues( Figure 6A). The low effective affinity of Cl- conduction indicates that there might not be a single strong site for ion coordination, but that the ions might instead weakly interact with the extended pore region( Qu and Hartzell, 2000)( Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). This is consistent with the fact that no single mutation was identified so far that weakened the strong selectivity for anions over cations( Figure 5—figure supplement 3). Although ion conduction was previously also reported for TMEM16 family members which function as lipid scramblases( Lee et al., 2016; Malvezzi et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2015), it was proposed that these processes are leaks accompanying the movement of lipids( Yu et al., 2015), which differs significantly from the selective anion permeation described here for TMEM16 channels. In summary, our work has unraveled how TMEM16 proteins use a similar architecture to exert substantially different functions. Both structures, namely the scramblase nhTMEM16 and the ion channel mTMEM16A, define the structural relationships within the family, whereby a hydrophilic membrane-exposed cavity in TMEM16 scramblases has changed to an aqueous membrane-shielded pore in TMEM16 channels( Figure 6B and Video 4). Despite the unusual functional breadth of the family, this ligand-gated ion channel turns out to share its mechanism for ion conduction with other, structurally unrelated, channel proteins.","answer":"Cell membranes are made up of two layers of oily molecules , called lipids , embedded with a variety of proteins . Each type of membrane protein carries out a particular activity for the cell , and many are involved in transporting other molecules from one side of the membrane to the other . The TMEM16 proteins are a large family of membrane proteins . Most are known as lipid scramblases and move lipids between the two layers of the membrane . However , some TMEM16 proteins transport ions in or out of the cell , and are instead called ion channels . TMEM16 proteins are found in animals , plants and fungi but not bacteria , and play key roles in many biological activities that keep these organisms alive . For example , in humans , ion channels belonging to the TMEM16 family help keep the lining of the lung moist , and allow muscles in the gut to contract . The structure of a scramblase shows that two protein units interact , with each unit containing a furrow that spans the membrane , through which lipids can move from one layer to the other . However , to date , the shape of a TMEM16 ion channel has not been determined . It was therefore not clear how a protein with features that let it transport large , oily molecules like lipids had evolved to transport small , charged particles instead . TMEM16A is a member of the TMEM16 family that transports negatively charged chloride ions . Using a technique called cryo-electron microscopy , Paulino et al . have determined the three-dimensional shape of the version of TMEM16A from a mouse . Overall , TMEM16A is organized similarly to the lipid scramblase . However , some parts of the TMEM16A protein have undergone rearrangements such that the membrane-exposed furrow that provides a path for lipids in scramblases is now partially sealed in TMEM16A . This results in an enclosed pore that is largely shielded from the oily membrane and through which ions can pass . Additionally , biochemical analysis suggests that TMEM16A forms a narrow pore that may widen towards the side facing the inside of the cell , though further work is needed to understand if this is relevant to the protein’s activity . The three-dimensional structure of TMEM16A reveals how the protein’s architecture differs from other family members working as lipid scramblases . It also gives insight into how TMEM16 proteins might work as ion channels . These findings can now form a strong basis for future studies into the activity of TMEM16 proteins ."},{"question":"Could you expound on the sequential procedure necessary for employing Google BigQuery as a storage mechanism for my extensive NoSQL database system, emphasizing the pivotal components that necessitate meticulous scrutiny during this procedure to ensure optimal effectiveness and stringent security? Furthermore, could you furnish a stratified elucidation for each scrutiny to augment my understanding of the complexities entailed in this procedure, encompassing potential impediments and efficacious tactics to circumvent them, in conjunction with the strategic advantages of specific solutions?","answer":"Step 1: Plan your BigQuery schema carefullyIn BigQuery, you have to predefine the entire schema and ensure all the data loaded fits the schema. Careful planning of BigQuery  schema includes managing relationships between different tables, deciding data types, etc. BigQuery schema can be modified but it could be expensive in terms of both time and cost. Step 2: Optimize your data format and sizeBigQuery is designed to handle large scale data, and it works best with denormalized data and large batch operations. If you the input data does not meet these requirements, you may need to implement preprocessing functions to transform the data format before loading into BigQuery. Also, BigQuery charges for the amount of data scanned during each query, so you should aim to reduce the data size as much as possible.Step 3: Utilize partitioning and clustering featuresBigQuery provides table partitioning and clustering features. Partitioning divides the table into smaller segments based on the time-unit column (hour, day, month, year), it\'s useful if you\'re regularly running queries that focus on a specific time range. Clustering rearranges the data based on specific columns, it\'s helpful when your queries are filtering based on these columns.Step 4: Establish security measuresBigQuery integrates with Google Cloud\'s IAM for access control. It\'s recommended to follow the principles of least privilege, granting users only necessary permissions. For data encryption, BigQuery automatically encrypts data at rest and in transit. For sensitive data, you should consider using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) where you control the cryptographic keys to manage the encryption and decryption process.Step 5: Develop a strategy for managing costsBigQuery uses a pay-per-use model that can lead to high costs if not managed well. One strategy is to utilize the flat-rate pricing model if data usage is sufficient to justify it. Implementing query optimizations such as partitioning, clustering, and denormalizing data can also help reduce costs as they result in smaller amounts of data being queried.Step 6: Perform testing and monitoringAfter setting up your BigQuery, it\'s essential to regularly monitor its performance and watch out for slow queries or problematic tables. Google provides Stackdriver for cost and performance monitoring. It\'s also worthwhile to conduct systematic testing of your setup, to make sure everything works as expected and to detect potential issues early.Potential impediments include suboptimal schema design which could lead to excessive costs or slow queries, lack of proper security leading to unauthorized data access, and inadequate cost management leading to unanticipated expenses. However, meticulous planning, systematic testing, and ongoing monitoring can help to mitigate these risks."},{"question":"Develop a dynamic HTML webpage that incorporates a superior header banner region, two unique separate content divisions, and a dynamic navigation bar.

When we need to update a range, we can postpone some updates until we need to access the items (respectively their position) at the bottom level. The pending updates are stored at the higher levels. These pending updates are propagated, or applied, when needed.The term \\"lazy\\" comes from the idea that we only do work when we have to. Rather than updating the entire tree every time we make a change, we only update the parts of the tree that we\'re interested in and record what changes we need to make elsewhere. If and when we visit a part of the tree with pending updates, then we perform the updates.Let\'s take an array for an example. If we want to update a segment (i.e., a sub-array), without lazy propagation, we must update all the elements in this segment, which could be slow if the segment is large. But with lazy propagation, we just mark the segment and update it when we really need to get the value in this segment. It saves a lot of time, and because of it, the complexity reduces from O(n) to O(log n).Here is a Python sample code for implementing a segment tree with lazy propagation:```python# segment tree as a listtree = [0] * (4*n)# array to store lazy updateslazy = [0] * (4*n)def build_tree(node, start, end):    if start == end:        tree[node] = arr[start]    else:        mid = (start + end) // 2        build_tree(2*node, start, mid)        build_tree(2*node+1, mid+1, end)        tree[node] = min(tree[2*node], tree[2*node+1])def update_tree(node, start, end, idx, val):    if start == end:        arr[idx] += val        tree[node] += val    else:        mid = (start + end) // 2        if start <= idx <= mid:            update_tree(2*node, start, mid, idx, val)        else:            update_tree(2*node+1, mid+1, end, idx, val)        tree[node] = min(tree[2*node], tree[2*node+1])def range_update(node, start, end, l, r, val):    if start > end or start > r or end < l: # out of bounds        return    if start == end: # leaf node        tree[node] += val        return    mid = (start + end) // 2    range_update(node*2, start, mid, l, r, val)    range_update(node*2 + 1, mid + 1, end, l, r, val)    tree[node] = min(tree[node*2], tree[node*2+1])    def range_query(node, start, end, l, r):    if r < start or end < l:        return 9999999 # out of bounds    if l <= start and end <= r:        return tree[node] # relevant segment    mid = (start + end) // 2    p1 = range_query(node*2, start, mid, l, r)    p2 = range_query(node*2 + 1, mid + 1, end, l, r)    return min(p1, p2)```In this python script, two functions - `range_update()` and `range_query()` - are created to implement segment tree with lazy propagation where `range_update()` is used to update a range by a value and `range_query()` is used to get the minimum number in a range."},{"question":"You will be shown sections from a scientific research paper, together with a question about the paper.

We propose to use a simple neural network architecture of Multilayer Perceptron with various types of input features including: lexical, syntactic, semantic and polarity features. Our system achieves very high performance in both subtasks of binary and multi-class irony detection in tweets. In particular, we rank third using the accuracy metric and fifth using the F1 metric. Our code is available at https://github.com/NIHRIO/IronyDetectionInTwitterIntroductionMining Twitter data has increasingly been attracting much research attention in many NLP applications such as in sentiment analysis BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 and stock market prediction BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 . Recently, Davidov2010 and Reyes2013 have shown that Twitter data includes a high volume of “ironic” tweets. For example, a user can use positive words in a Twitter message to her intended negative meaning (e.g., “It is awesome to go to bed at 3 am #not”). This especially results in a research challenge to assign correct sentiment labels for ironic tweets BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 .To handle that problem, much attention has been focused on automatic irony detection in Twitter BIBREF16 , BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 , BIBREF19 , BIBREF13 , BIBREF20 , BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 , BIBREF24 . In this paper, we propose a neural network model for irony detection in tweets. Our model obtains the fifth best performances in both binary and multi-class irony detection subtasks in terms of INLINEFORM0 score BIBREF25 . Details of the two subtasks can be found in the task description paper BIBREF25 . We briefly describe the subtasks as follows:DatasetThe dataset consists of 4,618 tweets (2,222 ironic + 2,396 non-ironic) that are manually labelled by three students. Some pre-processing steps were applied to the dataset, such as the emoji icons in a tweet are replaced by a describing text using the Python emoji package. Additionally, all the ironic hashtags, such as #not, #sarcasm, #irony, in the dataset have been removed. This makes difficult to correctly predict the label of a tweet. For example, “@coreybking thanks for the spoiler!!!! #not” is an ironic tweet but without #not, it probably is a non-ironic tweet. The dataset is split into the training and test sets as detailed in Table TABREF5 .Note that there is also an extended version of the training set, which contains the ironic hashtags. However, we only use the training set which does not contain the ironic hashtags to train our model as it is in line with the test set.Our modeling approachWe first describe our MLP-based model for ironic tweet detection in Section SECREF7 . We then present the features used in our model in Section SECREF8 .Neural network modelWe propose to use the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model BIBREF28 to handle both the ironic tweet detection subtasks. Figure FIGREF3 presents an overview of our model architecture including an input layer, two hidden layers and a softmax output layer. Given a tweet, the input layer represents the tweet by a feature vector which concatenates lexical, syntactic, semantic and polarity feature representations. The two hidden layers with ReLU activation function take the input feature vector to select the most important features which are then fed into the softmax layer for ironic detection and classification.FeaturesTable TABREF11 shows the number of lexical, syntactic, semantic and polarity features used in our model.Our lexical features include 1-, 2-, and 3-grams in both word and character levels. For each type of INLINEFORM0 -grams, we utilize only the top 1,000 INLINEFORM1 -grams based on the term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) values. That is, each INLINEFORM2 -gram appearing in a tweet becomes an entry in the feature vector with the corresponding feature value tf-idf. We also use the number of characters and the number of words as features.We use the NLTK toolkit to tokenize and annotate part-of-speech tags (POS tags) for all tweets in the dataset. We then use all the POS tags with their corresponding tf-idf values as our syntactic features and feature values, respectively.A major challenge when dealing with the tweet data is that the lexicon used in a tweet is informal and much different from tweet to tweet. The lexical and syntactic features seem not to well-capture that property. To handle this problem, we apply three approaches to compute tweet vector representations.Firstly, we employ 300-dimensional pre-trained word embeddings from GloVe BIBREF29 to compute a tweet embedding as the average of the embeddings of words in the tweet.Secondly, we apply the latent semantic indexing BIBREF30 to capture the underlying semantics of the dataset. Here, each tweet is represented as a vector of 100 dimensions.Thirdly, we also extract tweet representation by applying the Brown clustering algorithm BIBREF31 , BIBREF32 —a hierarchical clustering algorithm which groups the words with similar meaning and syntactical function together. Applying the Brown clustering algorithm, we obtain a set of clusters, where each word belongs to only one cluster. For example in Table TABREF13 , words that indicate the members of a family (e.g., “mum”, “dad”) or positive sentiment (e.g., “interesting”, “awesome”) are grouped into the same cluster. We run the algorithm with different number of clustering settings (i.e., 80, 100, 120) to capture multiple semantic and syntactic aspects. For each clustering setting, we use the number of tweet words in each cluster as a feature. After that, for each tweet, we concatenate the features from all the clustering settings to form a cluster-based tweet embedding.Motivated by the verbal irony by means of polarity contrast, such as “I really love this year\'s summer; weeks and weeks of awful weather”, we use the number of polarity signals appearing in a tweet as the polarity features. The signals include positive words (e.g., love), negative words (e.g., awful), positive emoji icon and negative emoji icon. We use the sentiment dictionaries provided by BIBREF33 to identify positive and negative words in a tweet. We further use boolean features that check whether or not a negation word is in a tweet (e.g., not, n\'t).Implementation detailsWe use Tensorflow BIBREF34 to implement our model. Model parameters are learned to minimize the the cross-entropy loss with L INLINEFORM0 regularization. Figure FIGREF16 shows our training mechanism. In particular, we follow a 10-fold cross-validation based voting strategy. First, we split the training set into 10 folds. Each time, we combine 9 folds to train a classification model and use the remaining fold to find the optimal hyperparameters. Table TABREF18 shows optimal settings for each subtask.In total, we have 10 classification models to produce 10 predicted labels for each test tweet. Then, we use the voting technique to return the final predicted label.MetricsThe metrics used to evaluate our model include accuracy, precision, recall and F INLINEFORM0 . The accuracy is calculated using all classes in both tasks. The remainders are calculated using only the positive label in subtask 1 or per class label (i.e., macro-averaged) in subtask 2. Detail description of the metrics can be found in BIBREF25 .Results for subtask 1Table TABREF21 shows our official results on the test set for subtask 1 with regards to the four metrics. By using a simple MLP neural network architecture, our system achieves a high performance which is ranked third and fifth out of forty-four teams using accuracy and F INLINEFORM0 metrics, respectively.Results for subtask 2Table TABREF23 presents our results on the test set for subtask 2. Our system also achieves a high performance which is ranked third and fifth out of thirty-two teams using accuracy and F INLINEFORM0 metrics, respectively. We also show in Table TABREF24 the performance of our system on different class labels. For ironic classes, our system achieves the best performance on the verbal irony by means of a polarity contrast with INLINEFORM1 of 60.73%. Note that the performance on the situational class is not high. The reason is probably that the number of situational tweets in the training set is small (205/3,834), i.e. not enough to learn a good classifier.DiscussionsApart from the described MLP models, we have also tried other neural network models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) BIBREF35 and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for relation classification BIBREF36 . We found that LSTM achieves much higher performance than MLP does on the extended training set containing the ironic hashtags (about 92% vs 87% with 10-fold cross-validation using INLINEFORM0 on subtask 1). However, without the ironic hashtags, the performance is lower than MLP\'s. We also employed popular machine learning techniques, such as SVM BIBREF37 , Logistic Regression BIBREF38 , Ridge Regression Classifier BIBREF39 , but none of them produces as good results as MLP does. We have also implemented ensemble models, such as voting, bagging and stacking. We found that with 10-fold cross-validation based voting strategy, our MLP models produce the best irony detection and classification results.ConclusionWe have presented our NIHRIO system for participating the Semeval-2018 Task 3 on “Irony detection in English tweets”. We proposed to use Multilayer Perceptron to handle the task using various features including lexical features, syntactic features, semantic features and polarity features. Our system was ranked the fifth best performing one with regards to F INLINEFORM0 score in both the subtasks of binary and multi-class irony detection in tweets.AcknowledgmentsThis research is supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Innovation Observatory at Newcastle University, United Kingdom.Figure 1: Overview of our model architecture for irony detection in tweets.Table 1: Basic statistics of the provided dataset.Figure 2: The training mechanism.Table 2: Number of features used in our modelTable 3: Example of clusters produced by the Brown clustering algorithm.Table 6: The performance (in %) of our model on the test set for subtask 2 (multi-class classification).Table 4: The optimal hyperparameter settings for subtasks 1 (A) and 2 (B).Table 7: The performance (in %) of our model on the test set for each class label in subtask 2.Table 5: The performance (in %) of our model on the test set for subtask 1 (binary classification).

Please summarize the main contribution of the work in a single sentence. Your response should include the summary and no additional text.Paper text:The cost of annotating training data has traditionally been a bottleneck for supervised learning approaches.The problem is further exacerbated when supervised learning is applied to a number of correlated tasks simultaneously since the amount of labels required scales with the number of tasks.To mitigate this concern, we propose an active multitask learning algorithm that achieves knowledge transfer between tasks.The approach forms a so-called committee for each task that jointly makes decisions and directly shares data across similar tasks.Our approach reduces the number of queries needed during training while maintaining high accuracy on test data.Empirical results on benchmark datasets show significant improvements on both accuracy and number of query requests.A triumph of machine learning is the ability to predict with high accuracy.However, for the dominant paradigm, which is supervised learning, the main bottleneck is the need to annotate data, namely, to obtain labeled training examples.The problem becomes more pronounced in applications and systems which require a high level of personalization, such as music recommenders, spam filters, etc.Several thousand labeled emails are usually sufficient for training a good spam filter for a particular user.However, in real world email systems, the number of registered users is potentially in the millions, and it might not be feasible to learn a highly personalized spam filter for each of them by getting several thousand labeled data points for each user.One method to relieve the need of the prohibitively large amount of labeled data is to leverage the relationship between the tasks, especially by transferring relevant knowledge from information-rich tasks to information-poor ones, which is called multitask learning in the literature.We consider multitask learning in an online setting where the learner sees the data sequentially, which is more practical in real world applications.In this setting, the learner receives an example at each time round, along with its task identifier, and then predicts its true label.Afterwards, the learner queries the true label and updates the model(s) accordingly.The online multitask setting has received increasing attention in the machine learning community in recent years BID6 BID0 BID7 BID9 BID4 BID13 BID11 .However, they make the assumption that the true label is readily available to be queried, which is impractical in many applications.Also, querying blindly can be inefficient when annotation is costly.Active learning further reduces the work of the annotator by selectively requesting true labels from the oracles.Most approaches in active learning for sequential and streambased problems adopt a measure of uncertainty / confidence of the learner in the current example BID5 BID3 BID12 BID8 BID1 .Therecent work by BID10 combines active learning with online multitask learning using peers or related tasks. Whenthe classifier of the current task is not confident, it first queries its similar tasks before requesting a true label from the oracle, incurring a lower cost. Theirlearner gives priority to the current task by always checking its confidence first. In thecase when the current task is confident, the opinions of its peers are ignored. This paperproposes an active multitask learning framework which is more humble, in a sense that both the current task and its peers\' predictions are considered simultaneously using a weighted sum. We have acommittee which makes joint decisions for each task. In addition, after the true label of a training sample is obtained, this sample is shared directly to similar tasks, which makes training more efficient.We propose a new active multitask learning algorithm that encourages more knowledge transfer among tasks compared to the state-of-the-art models, by using joint decision / prediction and directly sharing training examples with true labels among similar tasks.Our proposed methods achieve both higher accuracy and lower number of queries on three benchmark datasets for multitask learning problems.Future work includes theoretical analysis of the error bound and comparison with those of the baseline models.Another interesting direction is to handle unbalanced task data.In other words, one task has much more / less training data than the others.","answer":"We propose an active multitask learning algorithm that achieves knowledge transfer between tasks."},{"question":"Craft a concise narrative that cleverly incorporates the use of heteronyms, identical in spelling but diverging in meanings when articulated alternately, and ensure this linguistic ambiguity impacts both the character\'s decisions and plot progression.","answer":"As an AI, I\'ll try to craft a narrative as per your condition. Here we go:Once upon a time, there lived a lad named Reed, a cunning sorcerer in the humble town of Recount, famous for its lush Reed trees. Reed was often confused with these trees during town discussions, leading to multiple amusing misunderstandings. Throughout Recount, Reed was the sole sorcerer, but his spells were oddly impacted by the coincidental homonym/heteronym nature of his name. One day, an annual proclamation was made - \\"Time for the town to contribute to the annual Reed cutting. We need to ensure we\'ll survive the oncoming bitter winter.\\" People got ready with their tools, Reed though was taken aback. The announcement had unintentionally targeted him instead of the Reed trees, leaving him bewildered and in a state of fear because of the heteronymic confusion. Being an intelligent sorcerer, he decided to use this to his advantage. He cast a spell on himself to turn into a tree, in an allegory to the Reed chopping. After the transformation, he stood tall on the outskirts of Recount with the other Reed trees. The residents approached, axes in hands, oblivious to Reed\'s spell. As one of the townsmen started cutting the Reed trees, he suddenly exclaimed, \\"These trees refuse to give up even a single branch. They\'re too sturdy than ever before.\\" Puzzled, they tried again, but the trees were magically impervious. They glanced over the forest of Reed trees, perplexed. Meanwhile, Reed the tree felt a jolt. His magic was working, making himself and other trees invincible to the axes. However, he also realised the town genuinely needed wood for the coming winter. Hence, in a dilemma, witnessing firsthand the impact of his name\'s linguistic ambiguity, he changed his spell.Stepping down from his protective spells and turning back into human form, Reed announced, \\"The Reed trees are bestowed with my enchantment to protect them. The trees will only yield when axes are set down, and hands reach out to them in friendship instead of violence.\\"Amazed, the townsfolk did as Reed suggested. Instead of chopping, they gently pulled at the branches in friendship. The Reed trees willingly let go of the necessary branches. This encounter profoundly changed how they treated nature from that day, showing respect and care.Reed\'s clever use of heteronyms had indeed unintentionally led to a valuable lesson about harmony and the importance of respectful coexistence with nature."},{"question":"Develop a method that commands three arguments, an alphanumeric sequence, a singular symbol, and a numeral, then proceeds to give back a boolean response, validating if the given symbol manifests in the alphanumeric sequence precisely the denoted numeral of instances.","answer":"Here is a Python function that will fulfill this requirement:```pythondef check_symbol_count(sequence, symbol, count):    return sequence.count(symbol) == count```This function takes in three arguments as described: the alphanumeric sequence (expected to be a string), the symbol to look for in the sequence, and the desired numeral of occurrences. The Python function `count()` is then used on the alphanumeric sequence to count the number of times the specific symbol occurs in the sequence. This count is then compared to the given numeral to see if they are equal - if they are, the function will return `True`, otherwise it will return `False`.Here is an example of the function in use:```pythonprint(check_symbol_count(\'abcdefg1a3aa\', \'a\', 3))```This will output `True` since the symbol `a` occurs exactly 3 times in the given sequence. If you change the count to any number other than 3, the function will return `False`."},{"question":"In the process of conceptualizing a sophisticated mobile application utilizing Java, I\'m weighing the potential benefits of employing Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as my primary hosting infrastructure. Could you elucidate the distinctive advantages that this specific cloud service might provide, particularly when juxtaposed with other competing hosting platforms, taking into account multi-layered factors such as cost, scalability, and security?","answer":"Sure, let\'s break down the main reasons why you might consider Google Cloud Platform (GCP):1. Cost: Google Cloud Platform is generally cheaper when compared to other competitors like AWS and Azure. GCP offers a number of cost-saving options including sustained-use discounts, pre-emptive VMs, and custom VMs. It offers pricing innovations like per-second billing and commitment savings plans that rival its competitors. GCP also provides a free tier which includes 5 GB of Regional Storage US regions per month.2. Scalability: One of the key strengths of GCP is on-demand scalability. It is extremely helpful when your needs change suddenly - you can easily scale up or down without significant investment in infrastructure. GCP uses the same global infrastructure that Google uses for its end-user products, like Google Search and YouTube. So, you can scale your app to billions of users worldwide with ease.3. Security: GCP takes advantage of Google’s security model, which has been built upon over years and provides a secure environment for your data. All data stored in Google Cloud is encrypted at rest and in transit. It uses advanced security technologies like 2-step verification, SSL/TLS for data transfers, and includes a shared security model.4. Developer Tools: GCP offers a strong set of developer tools like Google Cloud SDK, Cloud Source Repositories, Cloud Tools for Eclipse, Cloud Tools for PowerShell, Cloud Tools for Visual Studio, and Google Plugin for Eclipse. They also provide powerful data analytics tools including BigQuery and machine learning platforms.5. Integration: GCP offers seamless integration with all Google services like Gmail, Google Drive etc., and has native support for all Google\'s development tools which makes GCP an easy choice if you’re already using or plan to use other Google services.6. Sustainability: Google\'s commitment to carbon neutrality and sustainability is a unique advantage if environmental concerns factor into your choice. Google has been carbon-neutral since 2007 and they strive to match 100% of their energy usage with renewable energy.Remember that the \'best\' cloud service depends largely on your specific requirements, so it\'s worth considering what key features are particularly important for your project when making your evaluation."},{"question":"Given two strings, write a function that finds the common characters between the two and removes all the duplicates characters from both.

Your program should not only explain but also demonstrate the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle through several implemented methods. These methods should include push, pop and peek. In addition to the basic functionality, your program should support advanced functions such as finding the minimum element in O(1) time, a function that returns the size of the stack, and another one which returns a boolean indicating whether the stack is empty or not. Your program should also handle exceptions gracefully, specifically, it should throw an exception when trying to pop an element from an empty stack. Include test cases to show the working of all the methods. For added complexity, base your stack on an array data structure rather than a linked list. This will require careful management of the array size, with functionality to increase the size of the array when the stack is full, and potentially decrease it when the stack becomes significantly empty to optimize memory usage. Use a programming language of your choice, but ensure that it represents and enforces the LIFO behavior properly. You are encouraged to provide a written explanation of how each part of your code contributes to the overall stack functionality.","answer":"Here is a basic Stack implementation in Python that uses the built-in list data type to construct a last-in, first-out (LIFO) stack. ```pythonclass Stack:    def __init__(self):        self.stack = []        self.min_stack = []    def push(self, val):        self.stack.append(val)        if not self.min_stack or val <= self.min_stack[-1]:            self.min_stack.append(val)    def pop(self):        if self.is_empty():            raise Exception(\\"Stack is empty.\\")        if self.peek() == self.get_min():            self.min_stack.pop()        return self.stack.pop()    def peek(self):        if self.is_empty():            raise Exception(\\"Stack is empty.\\")        return self.stack[-1]    def get_min(self):        if not self.min_stack:            raise Exception(\\"Stack is empty.\\")        return self.min_stack[-1]    def size(self):        return len(self.stack)    def is_empty(self):        return not bool(self.stack)stack = Stack()stack.push(3)stack.push(2)stack.push(1)print(stack.get_min())  # 1print(stack.pop())  # 1print(stack.get_min())  # 2print(stack.size())  # 2print(stack.is_empty())  # Falsestack.pop()stack.pop()print(stack.is_empty())  # True```Explanation:1. push: On each push, check if the pushed value is smaller than or equal to the top of min_stack (i.e., the smallest value encountered so far). If it is, push it into min_stack as the new smallest value.2. pop: On each pop, check if the popped value is the same as the top of min_stack. If it is, pop it from min_stack. This ensures that min_stack keeps track of the smallest values as they enter and exit the stack.3. get_min: Return the top of min_stack as the smallest value.4. size: Return the size of the stack.5. is_empty: Return whether the stack is empty.   This solution involves keeping track of the minimum value seen so far in an additional stack (min_stack). This enables the get_min function to always access the minimum element in O(1) time since it is always at the top of min_stack.  We\'re using Python\'s dynamic arrays (lists) which automatically handle increasing size when the array is full. When the size of the array is reduced, Python will also handle the memory optimization in the background."},{"question":"Develop a Flask-based API endpoint that showcases an introductory \\"Hello World!\\" message.","answer":"To accomplish this task, you will need to have Python\'s Flask micro web framework installed.

Thalidomide is an antiangiogenic drug and is clinically useful in a number of cancers. However, the molecular mechanism by which thalidomide exerts its antitumor effects is poorly understood. This study was designed to clarify the relationship between antiangiogenesis and antitumor effects of thalidomide and to explore the molecular mechanism for its antitumor activity. We evaluated the effects of thalidomide on the growth of human tumor cells expressing (MCF-7 and HL-60) or not expressing (HeLa and K562) COX-2 in vitro. We also studied the effects of thalidomide on COX-1, COX-2 or bcl-2 expression, TNFalpha, VEGF, GSH and cytochrome c in these cells. Thalidomide could inhibit tumor growth in a concentration-dependent manner in MCF-7 and HL-60; its IC50s for them were 18.36+/-2.34 and 22.14+/-2.15 microM, respectively, while this effect was not observed in HeLa and K562. Thalidomide reduced COX-2 expression accompanied by a decrease of bcl-2 protein, TNFalpha, VEGF, GSH and an increased cytochrome c, but had no effect on that of COX-1, in MCF-7 and HL-60. Moreover, cells not expressing COX-2 were insensitive to the growth-inhibitory and effects on cytokines of thalidomide. In our mouse xenograft model of OVCAR-3 and HCT-8, we found that thalidomide could decrease intratumoral microvessel density in both tumors; it exerted antitumor effects only on OVCAR-3 expressing COX-2 but did not on HCT-8 not expressing COX-2. Effect of thalidomide on COX-1 and COX-2 in vivo was consistent with that of in vitro. These results demonstrated that thalidomide might inhibit growth of tumors through COX-2 degradation independent of antiangiogenesis.","answer":"[[\\"thalidomide\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"COX-2\\"], [\\"thalidomide\\", \\"INDIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"bcl-2\\"], [\\"thalidomide\\", \\"INDIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"cytochrome c\\"], [\\"Thalidomide\\", \\"INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR\\", \\"cytochrome c\\"], [\\"Thalidomide\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"COX-2\\"], [\\"Thalidomide\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"TNFalpha\\"], [\\"Thalidomide\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"VEGF\\"], [\\"Thalidomide\\", \\"NOT\\", \\"COX-1\\"], [\\"Thalidomide\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"bcl-2\\"], [\\"Thalidomide\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"COX-2\\"], [\\"thalidomide\\", \\"INDIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"TNFalpha\\"], [\\"thalidomide\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"COX-1\\"], [\\"thalidomide\\", \\"INDIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"COX-2\\"], [\\"thalidomide\\", \\"INDIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"VEGF\\"], [\\"thalidomide\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"COX-2\\"], [\\"thalidomide\\", \\"INDIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"COX-1\\"]]"},{"question":"Develop a sophisticated computational tool using the Java programming language, which not only encompasses fundamental arithmetic operations but also integrates advanced trigonometric function computations, thereby providing a holistic mathematical apparatus for scientific calculations.","answer":"The brief given requires the development of an advanced calculator which would include basic arithmetic functions along with advanced trigonometric functions.Below is a simple example of how a class that fulfills these requirements can be structured in Java.

The expression 1^1 - 2^2 + 3^3 - 4^4 + ... + 1000^1000 is represented in the Python program as sum([(-1)(i+1) * (ii) for i in range(1,1001)])This list comprehension generates a list of the first 1000 terms in the series, then the built-in sum function adds them together.However, since the series gets quite large quite quickly, it\'s important to calculate the modulo 10^10 at each step to avoid storing a large number in memory.Here is the Python code for getting the last ten digits of the series.```pythonlast_ten_digits = sum(((-1)(i+1) * (ii)) % 1010 for i in range(1, 1001)) % 1010print(last_ten_digits)```This code first constructs a generator that generates each term of the series (mod 1010), then sums them together (again mod 1010) to get the last ten digits of the series.

File Organization: Organize your files systematically to ensure easy retrieval later. Use appropriate names for folders and sub-folders; include version information for easier management if you update your 3D models frequently. This way, you can always be assured that your most recent work is securely stored.2. Choose the Correct Storage Class: Amazon S3 Glacier offers several storage classes, which vary in cost and access speeds. If you need to frequently access your 3D models for updates, consider using S3 Standard or Intelligent-Tiering storage, which provide fast, real-time access. If you just need to back up data that is infrequently accessed, consider the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes, which have lower costs but longer retrieval times.3. Enable Object Versioning: This feature enables you to maintain multiple versions of an object in a bucket. With this, you can preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of your 3D models, which is useful for adding layers of protection and mitigating the risk of accidental deletion or alterations.4. Use Lifecycle Policies: Implement lifecycle policies to transition your files between different storage classes automatically, depending on how often you access them. This is an effective way to manage storage costs. For example, you could store new data in the S3 Standard class for quick access, then move it to S3 Glacier after 30 days if it\'s not accessed frequently.5. Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enable MFA Delete on your AWS account to provide an additional layer of security. This requires any user to provide two forms of identification before they can delete or alter any version of files. This protects your data from both accidental and intentional deletions.6. Regular Audits: Regularly review and audit your stored files. This exercise helps to check the health of your data, determine if any files are missing, spot any inconsistencies, and ensure the integrity and availability of your data.7. Data Validation: Use features like ETag, a part of the metadata which Amazon S3 returns in the response to an upload, to validate that the data on S3 matches the original source data. This ensures that your data remains unaltered and intact in its pristine form.8. Backup: Making routine backups to your 3D models can be crucial in safeguarding your modeling and animation work. Automated backups could be setup using AWS SDK to ensure consistency and lessen manual labor.9. Encryption: Encrypt your data at rest and in transit for secure transmission over networks and secure storage. AWS provides numerous encryption features that will make it difficult for unauthorized persons to access your files, even if they somehow manage to get their hands on them."},{"question":"創建一種算法，用於列印兩個數組的公共元素。arr1 = [3, 10, 15, 7]arr2 = [7, 8, 5, 10]","answer":"Sure, I\'ll provide the solution in Python programming language.```python# initialization of listsarr1 = [3, 10, 15, 7]arr2 = [7, 8, 5, 10]# using intersection of setscommon_elements = list(set(arr1) & set(arr2))# print the common elementsprint(common_elements)```This algorithm converts the lists to sets and then uses intersection method of set to find common elements.

This scrutiny should incorporate a stratified methodology, amalgamating theoretical comprehension and practical application of linear algebraic tenets, necessitating a systematic progression of operations. Moreover, the scrutiny should also contemplate the potential repercussions of the outcomes on the expansive domain of linear algebra, encompassing its theoretical underpinnings and practical utilities, whilst also pondering the potential for revolutionary findings or paradigmatic transformations.","answer":"The stated matrix M is:M = [[5, 10, -20],      [-10, -20, 40],      [20, 40, -80]]This is a symmetrical matrix, which simplifies calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. However, it must be noticed that this matrix is a scalar multiple of a singular matrix (a matrix whose determinant is zero, meaning it does not have an inverse):B = [[1, 2, -4],      [-2, -4, 8],      [4, 8, -16]]Now, a scalar multiple of a singular matrix is also a singular matrix, and you would find that the determinant of M is zero thus confirming its singularity. Now, it is known that a singular matrix always has at least one eigenvalue that is zero. This can be quickly seen here:The characteristic equation of a matrix M is given by det(M - λI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and λ represents eigenvalues. Solving this for M, given that it is singular with determinant zero we obtain:- λ^3 - 0λ^2 + 0λ - 0 = 0  - λ^3 = 0  The roots of this equation are λ = 0, which we already anticipated to be true as M is singular. The multiplicity of the eigenvalue is three. Now we need to find the eigenvectors associated with each eigenvalue. The equation is (M- λI)v = 0, which simplifies to Mv = 0 for λ = 0. Any vector that is in the nullspace of M is an eigenvector of M. But as M is a singular matrix, this is non-trivial and there are infinite solutions to this, indicating infinite eigenvectors.The implications of these outcomes on linear algebra are substantial. This exemplifies in a practical sense the connection between matrix singularity, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, giving a hands-on illustration of how mathematical theory can be deduced from matrix manipulation. It\'s not revolutionarily groundbreaking, as understanding the connection between singular matrices and eigenvalues is a fundamental part of linear algebra study. However, the exercise exemplifies how meticulous analyses can lead to dense understanding of matrices behavior and thus equip us with the knowledge to tackle more complex matrix analyses. This offers the potential for future fundamental breakthroughs in larger, more complex problems of linear algebra."},{"question":"If Ron\'s garden contains 42 plants and every row can accommodate 7 plants, which mathematical operation would you use to determine how many rows are in Ron\'s garden?","answer":"To determine the number of rows in Ron\'s garden, you would need to use the mathematical operation of division.

So we can expect a full cycle to be less than 30092030 numbers long. We can calculate the period of the sequence iteration, then use that period to find the value at 10^20.First, we calculate the sequence until we find a repetition. After that, we calculate the length of the period (the distance between two values). Given that, we calculate 10^20 modulo the length of our period, since modulo operation distributes over addition, i.e., (a + b) mod n = (a mod n + b mod n) mod n. We can just continue from where we stopped but now for (10^20 % period)-th times. Python code:```pythonmodulus = 30092030sequence = [1]*3000  # h_n = 1 for 0 <= n <= 2999sequenceSet = set(sequence)n = 3000while True:    sequence.append((sequence[n-3000] + sequence[n-2999]) % modulus)    if sequence[-3000:] in sequenceSet:        break    sequenceSet.add(sequence[-3000:])    n += 1    period = len(sequence) - 3000    # Calculate the period (the distance between two values)hn_mod = sequence[1020 % period]print(hn_mod)```This code could take substantial time to run due to a huge number of iterations of the loop for (10^20 % period)-th times. This issue could be mitigated by storing the values of the sequence in an ordered way, and when we find a duplicate we can track back to the first appearance of that number (not applicable to languages which do not maintain order in the Set datatype).The main logic here is taking advantage of a property that a mathematical sequence takes which results in it repeating after a certain value and then using the modulo operation to find what the sequence value would be after 10^20 iterations. However, the output of the code can\'t be displayed here because it takes a very long time to compute due to the large numbers involved."},{"question":"I have a C# singleton class that multiple classes use.

When concurrent threads are running, one thread may preempt another at any point in their execution -- including in the middle of the `Toggle()` method. For example, imagine the following sequence of events:1. Thread A enters `Toggle()` and reads `value` as 0.2. Thread A is interrupted by thread B.3. Thread B enters `Toggle()`, sees `value` as 0, and sets it to 1.4. Thread A resumes and sets `value` to 1 without checking its current value - because it had seen `value` as 0 before the interruption.As a result, your program may not behave optimally in a multi-threaded environment.To make your `Toggle()` method thread-safe, you need to use thread synchronization. You can use the `lock` keyword in C# to allow only one thread at a time to execute a block of code. Here\'s an example of how you could make your method thread-safe:```C#private readonly object syncLock = new object();public int Toggle(){    lock (syncLock)    {        if(value == 0)         {            value = 1;         }        else if(value == 1)         {             value = 0;         }        return value;    }   }```Now, any thread that wants to call `Toggle()` must acquire the `syncLock` object. If another thread already owns the lock, the thread will block until the lock is available.

Finally, write a function to print the elements of this two-dimensional array in a structured manner.","answer":"Here is a simple solution using ArrayList:```javaimport java.util.*;public class DynamicArray {    private ArrayList<ArrayList<String>> array;    public DynamicArray() {        array = new ArrayList<>();    }    public void setSecondDimension(int index, int size) {        while (index >= array.size()) {            array.add(new ArrayList<>());        }        ArrayList<String> innerArray = array.get(index);        while (innerArray.size() < size) {            innerArray.add(\\"\\");        }    }    public void addElement(int index, String element) {        if (index == array.size()) {            array.add(new ArrayList<>());        }        ArrayList<String> innerArray = array.get(index);        innerArray.add(element);    }    public void printElements() {        for (int i = 0; i < array.size(); i++) {            ArrayList<String> innerArray = array.get(i);            for (int j = 0; j < innerArray.size(); j++) {                System.out.print(innerArray.get(j) + \\" \\");            }            System.out.println(\\"\\");        }    }    public static void main(String[] args) {        DynamicArray arr = new DynamicArray();        arr.setSecondDimension(0,5);        arr.addElement(0, \\"Hello\\");        arr.addElement(0, \\"World\\");        arr.setSecondDimension(1,4);        arr.addElement(1, \\"Hello\\";        arr.addElement(1, \\"again\\");        arr.printElements();    }}```In this program I have created a dynamic two-dimensional array of strings. The method `setSecondDimension(int index, int size)` is used to determine the size of the second dimension. It first makes sure the outer ArrayList is big enough to contain an ArrayList at the given index and all earlier indices by adding new ArrayLists until the outer ArrayList is large enough. Then, it makes sure the inner ArrayList at the given index is big enough by adding empty strings until it reaches the specified capacity.The method `addElement(int index, String element)` handles adding elements to the two-dimensional array. If the array could overflow (determined by if the passed index equals the current size of the array), the method increases the size of the array by adding a new inner ArrayList, then adds the string element.The `printElements()` function goes through each element of the two-dimensional array and prints it to the console in a structured manner."},{"question":"Devise a C++ coding structure designated to calculate the aggregate value of the most extended consecutive subsequence contained within a provided array of integer values.","answer":"Here is a C++ code that calculates the sum of the longest continuous subsequence in an integer array.```cpp#include<bits/stdc++.h>using namespace std;int longestConseqSubseq(int arr[], int n){    unordered_set<int> S;    int ans = 0;    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)        S.insert(arr[i]);      for (int i=0; i<n; i++)    {        if (S.find(arr[i]-1) == S.end())        {            int j = arr[i];            int sum = 0;            while (S.find(j) != S.end())            {                sum += j;                j++;            }              ans = max(ans, sum);        }    }    return ans;}int main() {    int arr[] = {1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2};    int n = sizeof arr/ sizeof arr[0];    cout << \\"Sum of longest subsequence is \\"        << longestConseqSubseq(arr, n);    return 0;}```This code treats the array as a unique set to facilitate element look ups. The idea is to check for each element in the array, if it is the starting point of a subsequence. For every element arr[i] in the array, check if arr[i] - 1 is present in the array. If present then arr[i] is not the starting point of any subsequence, if it is not present then it \'may\' be the start of a sequence. We then count the number of elements in the possible sequence and keep track of the sum for each sequence. If the sum is higher than our previous maximum, we update it.

I don\'t necessarily need anything that\'s hyper-secure nor do I need anything that\'s lightning fast, but those things would be nice.  Primarily, I just want something that\'s easy to implement without being terribly slow or insecure.","answer":"One simple and common way to secure passwords in a database is by using a method known as hashing, specifically through a cryptographic function such as bcrypt or Argon2. Here\'s a basic rundown of how you could implement such a scheme:1. When a user creates an account or changes their password, instead of storing their password directly, you process it through a cryptographic hash function like bcrypt or Argon2. This function generates a string of characters called a hash, which is unique to the password entered. You then store this hash in your database.2. When a user attempts to log in, you take the password they entered and process it through the same hash function. If the hash that is generated matches the hash stored in your database, you know the user entered the correct password.This method has many advantages:- Even if your database is breached and the hashes are stolen, it\'s very tough to reverse-engineer a password from a hash.- bcrypt and Argon2 are designed to be expensive to execute, making it unfeasible to generate enough hashes for attacking the database through brute force.- These algorithms allow for the use of a \'salt\', a random piece of data given as input to the hash function alongside the user\'s password. This means even if two users have the same password, the hashes will look different, making it harder for attackers to figure out what the actual passwords are.While running bcrypt or Argon2 might be slower than alternative methods, it\'s usually imperceptible to your users while providing a lot of extra security.Don\'t try to implement a custom encryption scheme or use simpler secure hash algorithms like SHA256 for storing passwords. The risk of implementing these incorrectly is high, and even if implemented correctly, they could be attacked via rainbow tables or fast brute-force attacks."},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

The language grounding problem has come in many different flavors with just as many different approaches. The underlying hypothesis is that the meanings of words are explicitly tied to our perception and understanding of the world around us, and textual-information alone is insufficient for a complete understanding of language.Citation Sentence:Some approaches apply semantic parsing , where words and sentences are mapped to logical structure meaning ( Kate and Mooney , 2007 ) .Context after the citation:Others provide automatic mappings of natural language instructions to executable actions, such as interpreting navigation directions (Chen and Mooney, 2011) or robot commands (Tellex et al., 2011; Matuszek et al., 2012). Some efforts have tackled tasks such as automatic image caption generation (Feng and Lapata, 2010a; Ordonez et al., 2011), text illustration (Joshi et al., 2006), or automatic location identification of Twitter users (Eisenstein et al., 2010; Wing and Baldridge, 2011; Roller et al., 2012). Another line of research approaches grounded language knowledge by augmenting distributional approaches of word meaning with perceptual information (Andrews et al., 2009; Steyvers, 2010; Feng and Lapata, 2010b; Bruni et al., 2011; Silberer and Lapata, 2012; Johns and Jones, 2012; Bruni et al., 2012a; Bruni et al., 2012b; Silberer et al., 2013). Although these approaches have differed in model definition, the general goal in this line of research has been to enhance word meaning with perceptual information in order to address one of the most common criticisms of distributional semantics: that the âmeaning of words is entirely given by other wordsâ (Bruni et al., 2012b).","answer":"Background"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2018 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  In this paper, we evaluate the energy-efficiency of LTE for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications with small data transmissions. We quantify the minimum resources that can be allocated in LTE for the uplink and we show that the energy-efficiency of the transmissions of small blocks of data strongly depends on the transmission power and the Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) procedure. Indeed, when an aggressive Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) is used thanks to good channel quality, the energy-efficiency of LTE decreases for the transmission of small amounts of data, as the physical resource blocks are under-utilized. In addition, we propose a solution to deal with this drawback by selecting an optimal MCS and utilizing the LTE Uplink Power Control (UPC) mechanism. The results presented in this paper are based on open-source ns-3 computer-based simulations. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  The 3GPP has raised the need to revisit the design of next generations of cellular networks in order to make them capable and efficient to provide M2M services. One of the key challenges that has been identified is the need to enhance the operation of the random access channel of LTE and LTE-A. The current mechanism to request access to the system is known to suffer from congestion and overloading in the presence of a huge number of devices. For this reason, different research groups around the globe are working towards the design of more efficient ways of managing the access to these networks in such circumstances. This paper aims to provide a survey of the alternatives that have been proposed over the last years to improve the operation of the random access channel of LTE and LTE-A. A comprehensive discussion of the different alternatives is provided, identifying strengths and weaknesses of each one of them, while drawing future trends to steer the efforts over the same shooting line. In addition, while existing literature has been focused on the performance in terms of delay, the energy efficiency of the access mechanism of LTE will play a key role in the deployment of M2M networks. For this reason, a comprehensive performance evaluation of the energy efficiency of the random access mechanism of LTE is provided in this paper. The aim of this computer-based simulation study is to set a baseline performance upon which new and more energy-efficient mechanisms can be designed in the near future. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  For M2M (Machine-to-Machine) machines in cellular networks, employing high transmission rates or transmitting in large power actually cost them much energy. This is harmful to the machines, especially they are operated by batteries. The Relay Node (RN) in Long-Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) networks is used to enhance the coverage of high data rate and solve the coverage hole problem. Considering the limited energy nature of machines, connecting to the RN instead of the BS is a better choice for cell-edge machines. In this paper, we consider an uplink resource and power allocation problem for energy conservation in LTE-A relay networks. The objective is to minimize the total energy consumption of machines while guarantee their quality of service (QoS). We prove this uplink resource and power allocation problem to be NP-complete and develop an energy-conserved resource and power allocation method to solve the problem. Simulation results show that our algorithm can effectively reduce the energy consumption of machines and guarantee their required service qualities. Keywords—LTE-A; machine-to-machine (M2M); Internet of Things (IoT); energy efficiency; resource allocation; relay networks.Literature Review:","answer":"In this subsection, we will discuss the solutions for the overload or congestion issue. Cheng et al. BIB001 discussed push and pull based methods to overcome the overload problem in the radio access network. They also proposed methods to alleviate the congestion problem in the core network, including the use of extended access barring, extended wait timer, and delay tolerant indicator. Laya et al. BIB003 presented random access techniques to avoid the congestion and overloading problem that massive IoT/MTC devices face in the 3GPP network environment. They developed more energy efficient mechanisms for the existing baseline techniques, e.g., access class barring, back-off adjustment schemes, dynamic allocation of Random Access Channel (RACH) resources, prioritized random access, etc. Zheng et al.  provided a solution to signaling message storms like RACH messages in the presence of both Human Type Communications (HTC) and MTC. The solution is to split HTC and MTC devices into two groups, and an evolved NodeB (eNB) makes prioritization decisions to grant access according to a type of a device. For example, if a collision occurs because of MTC devices, then a priority will be given to HTC devices. Abdalla et al.  proposed that available radio resources in terms of time and frequency, called Resource Blocks (RBs), should be divided into two groups, i.e., a UE specific set dedicated to UEs and an M2M specific set dedicated to M2M devices. Separate Quality of Service Class Indicators (QCIs) are defined for both types of devices so that user quality of experience should not be affected in the presence of different types of devices. The proper resource allocation of Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) and transmit power is a key factor to energy efficient communications. Wang et al. BIB002 proposed an energy efficient solution for optimal MCS determination and LTE uplink power control, and implemented it to transfer MTC data over an LTE network. Silva et al.  noted that devices in an LTE network send signaling messages for downlink or uplink channel condition assessment to their eNB, which has to make a scheduling decision in every 1 ms. To resolve the problem, they suggested that when an eNB notices any performance degradation by employing statistical and machine learning techniques, it can instruct devices to stop reporting downlink or uplink related channel information to save their power. Chen et al. BIB004 proposed the usage of LTE-Advanced relays and focused on uplink resource and transmit power allocation to save the energy of MTC devices. In the presence of LTE-Advanced relays that can enhance radio coverage and data rates, and increase the throughput of cell edge devices, they proposed optimal MCS and transmit power allocation for energy efficient communication through the relays. In the discussed solutions, we notice that decisions for overload control and resource allocation are only determined by a single eNB. More optimal decisions can be possible if a group of eNBs share their information about camping-on MTC devices to make global information."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

A case of genuine stress incontinence due to prazosin, a common antihypertensive drug, is presented. Prazosin exerts its antihypertensive effects through vasodilatation caused by selective blockade of postsynaptic alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. As an alpha-blocker, it also exerts a significant relaxant effect on the bladder neck and urethra. The patient\'s clinical course is described and correlated with initial urodynamic studies while on prazosin and subsequent studies while taking verapamil. Her incontinence resolved with the change of medication. The restoration of continence was accompanied by a substantial rise in maximum urethral pressure, maximum urethral closure pressure, and functional urethral length. Patients who present with stress incontinence while taking prazosin should change their antihypertensive medication before considering surgery, because their incontinence may resolve spontaneously with a change in drug therapy.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"verapamil\\", \\"Prazosin\\", \\"prazosin\\"], \\"Disease\\": [\\"stress incontinence\\", \\"incontinence\\"]}"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

The Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a potent activator of long terminal repeat-directed transcription. While in most cell types, activation requires interaction of Tat with the unusual transcription element TAR, astrocytic glial cells support TAR-independent transactivation of HIV-1 transcription by Tat. This alternative pathway of Tat activation is mediated by the viral enhancer, a kappa B domain capable of binding the prototypical form of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) present in many cell types, including T lymphocytes. Tat transactivation mediated by the kappa B domain is sufficient to allow replication of TAR-deleted mutant HIV-1 in astrocytes. The present study demonstrates the existence of kappa B-specific binding factors present in human glial astrocytes that differ from prototypical NF-kappa B. The novel astrocyte-derived kappa B-binding activity is retained on an HIV-1 Tat affinity column, while prototypical NF-kappa B from Jurkat T cells is not. In vitro transcription studies demonstrate that astrocyte-derived kappa B-binding factors activate transcription of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat and that this activation is dependent on the kappa B domain. Moreover, TAR-independent transactivation of HIV-1 transcription is reproduced in vitro in an astrocyte factor-dependent manner which correlates with kappa B-binding activity. The importance of the central nervous system-enriched kappa B transcription factor in the regulation of HIV-1 expression is discussed.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"Jurkat T cells\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"astrocytes\\", \\"human glial astrocytes\\", \\"Central nervous system - derived cells\\", \\"astrocytic glial cells\\", \\"T lymphocytes\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"long terminal repeat\\", \\"kappa B domain\\", \\"TAR\\", \\"HIV - 1 long terminal repeat\\", \\"transcription element\\", \\"viral enhancer\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"The Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV - 1)\\", \\"kappa B - specific binding factors\\", \\"central nervous system - enriched kappa B\\", \\"Tat\\", \\"astrocyte - derived kappa B - binding factors\\", \\"transcription factor\\", \\"NF - kappa B\\", \\"Tat protein\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

There are also limited data concerning cardiac production of the latter two. We studied 192 consecutive patients eligible for RFA of AF referred to the University Hospital, Linköping, Sweden. NT-proBNP, MR-proANP, copeptin, and MR-proADM levels were measured in peripheral blood, the coronary sinus (CS), and the left atrium before ablation, and in peripheral blood immediately and the day after RFA. The level of NT-proBNP decreased the day after RFA in participants in AF at the time of RFA, compared to the participants in sinus rhythm who showed a slight increase (P<0.001). Furthermore, regardless of the actual rhythm, the level of MR-proANP showed an increase immediately after RFA (P<0.001), followed by a decrease the day after ablation (P<0.001). Copeptin level showed a 6-fold increase immediately after RFA compared to baseline (P<0.001), whereas MR-proADM level increased the day after RFA (P<0.001). Levels of copeptin and MR-proADM were not higher in the CS compared to peripheral blood. RFA of AF is a strong stimulus with a significant and direct impact on different neurohormonal systems. We found no sign of a cardiac release of MR-proADM or copeptin. URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

The Denys-Drash syndrome is characterised by a typical nephropathy, genital abnormalities and also predisposes to the development of Wilms tumor. These patients eventually go into end stage renal failure. A candidate Wilms tumor gene, WT1, from the 11p13 chromosome region has recently been cloned. We have analysed the DNA sequence in constitutional cells from eight patients and have shown heterozygous mutations in six of them. Four of the mutations were in exon 9, all resulting in missense mutations. Three were at nucleotide position 1180 resulting in an arg > trp amino acid change. The other was at position 1186 converting an asp > asn in the predicted resultant protein. One patient had a missense mutation in exon 8, converting an arg > his. A single base pair insertion at nucleotide position 821 in exon 6 resulted in the generation of a premature stop codon in the last patient. We were unable to find a mutation in one patient despite complete sequencing of the genomic sequence of the gene. The last patient carried a constitutional deletion of the 11p13 region and no additional mutation was found. There was no obvious correlation between the type of mutation and phenotypic expression. These results further demonstrate that the WT1 gene is important in both the development of the kidney and the genito-urinary system..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"Denys-Drash syndrome\\", \\"Wilms tumor\\", \\"genital abnormalities\\", \\"nephropathy\\", \\"renal failure\\"]}"},{"question":"I got the ModuleNotFoundError and cannot install cv2.

Examples:        hefty_numbers([5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]) should give [1, 2]        hefty_numbers([10, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) should return [2, 3]        hefty_numbers([8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]) should yield [8, 9]    \'\'\'","answer":"Here is a Python solution:```pythondef hefty_numbers(seq):    # compute frequency    freq = {}    for n in seq:        if n not in freq:            freq[n] = 1        else:            freq[n] += 1    # generate fibonacci sequence     fib = [0, 1]    while fib[-1] < len(seq):        fib.append(fib[-2] + fib[-1])     hefties = []    for num, occurence in freq.items():        if occurence > 2*num and occurence in fib:            hefties.append(num)                return heftiesprint(hefty_numbers([5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]))  # [1, 2]print(hefty_numbers([10, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]))  # [2, 3]print(hefty_numbers([8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]))  # [8, 9]```In this code, the `hefty_numbers` function first computes the frequency of each number in the given list. It then generates a sequence of Fibonacci numbers up to the length of the input list. At this point, we have all the information to determine which numbers are hefty: we iterate over the frequencies and add the number to the result list if its frequency is more than double the number itself and is a Fibonacci number. If no such number is found, an empty list will be returned."},{"question":"Develop a method to construct an accurate regular expression for extracting URLs from a log file in Java.","answer":"A regular expression is a powerful tool for parsing textual data and can be incredibly helpful for extracting URLs from text, such as a log file. Here\'s how you can construct a regular expression to extract URLs in Java.First of all, you need to define what constitutes a URL. A basic definition could be anything that:1. Begins with `http://`, `https://`, `ftp://`, or `www`.2. Followed by one or more alphanumeric or special characters.3. Ends in a domain suffix like `.com`, `.net`, `.org`, `.io`, etc.Here is a regular expression that captures that:```javaPattern urlPattern = Pattern.compile(        \\"(https?|ftp|www)://[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)+([-._~:/?#[]@!&\'()*+,;=]*)\\");```This pattern is divided into three parts:1. `(https?|ftp|www)` matches `http`, `https`, `ftp`, or `www`.2. `://[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)+` matches the domain, including subdomains.3. `([-._~:/?#[]@!&\'()*+,;=]*)` matches any URI components that might appear after the domain.Next, you can use the `Matcher` class to work with the above regular expression. Assuming `line` is a string containing the current line of the log file you wish to extract URLs from, here\'s how you can extract those URLs:```javaMatcher matcher = urlPattern.matcher(line);while (matcher.find()) {    System.out.println(matcher.group());}```This code will print all URLs in the current log line.Keep in mind that this is a basic regular expression and may not cover all possible cases. URLs can be incredibly complex with all of their optional parts, and creating a regular expression to perfectly match every possible URL is almost impossible. However, this should work fine for most common URLs. It\'s advisable to have some understanding of what URLs may show up in your log files and write custom regular expression that cover these cases."},{"question":"Construct an outbound policy for a sophisticated Intrusion Prevention System (Firewall) that impedes data transfer stemming from a predetermined IPv4 address and IPv6 address. Additionally, the system must also detect, document, and automatically handle attempts at data packet spoofing. The predetermined IPv4 address is 123.123.123.123 and you must choose an appropriate IPv6 address for this task.","answer":"This policy problem is rather complicated, but it can be achieved using a combination of a programming language like Python and systems that ALREADY exist to check and enforce network policies like iptables, without having to create a complete Intrusion Prevention System from scratch.Firstly, let\'s setup the iptables rules for blocking specific IP addresses:```bash# replace these with your actual IPv4 or IPv6# IPv4: 123.123.123.123# For this example, we used IPv6: 2001:db8::68 which is a test address # and you should replace it with a valid one# for IPv4iptables -A OUTPUT -s 123.123.123.123 -j DROPiptables -A INPUT -d 123.123.123.123 -j DROP# for IPv6ip6tables -A OUTPUT -s 2001:db8::68 -j DROPip6tables -A INPUT -d 2001:db8::68 -j DROP```The above iptables commands will filter out the outbound and inbound traffic from the predefined IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.For detecting, recording, and handling spoofing attempts, we will need to analyze packet data. This involves parsing incoming packets, checking their source IP addresses against expected IP addresses, and then handling any discrepancies. This kind of task would best be handled with a script using a platform like Scapy for Python.```pythonfrom scapy.all import *def packet_analysis(packet):    if IP in packet:        source_ip = packet[IP].src        dst_ip = packet[IP].dst        if source_ip == \\"123.123.123.123\\" or source_ip == \\"2001:db8::68\\":            print(f\\"Spoofing detected from {source_ip} to {dst_ip}\\")            # add any automatic handling here            # for example, we can add the fraudulent source IP to iptables            os.system(f\\"iptables -A INPUT -s {source_ip} -j DROP\\")sniff(prn=packet_analysis)```What this script does is sniff for incoming packets, then analyze them. If any of these packets have source IP address as the blocked ip addresses, then it logs the suspicious activity as \\"Spoofing detected\\" and automatically adds it to the iptables list.Remember, this answer is a simplified representation of a real-world solution and should be considered as a starting point. An actual solution would require more specificity, robustness, and consideration for complicated cases. Also, directly modifying IP table rules requires careful handling as it could disrupt existing connections or have security implications. In enterprise scenarios, using established Intrusion Prevention Systems with comprehensive features would be recommended. Items discussed such as IP filtering, packet inspection, logging, and blocking are just a fraction of real-world considerations in network security."},{"question":"Create a Cascading Style Sheets class (CSS) not only manifesting the capability to influence and transform the colorimetric properties of any inline or block-level textual elements enclosed within its declared parameters to appear within the hue palette of azure blue, but also needs to incorporate a hover effect that gradually changes the color to citrine yellow upon mouseover.

Then, in .text-transformer:hover, the color property changes to \\"#E4D00A\\", which is the hexadecimal code for the Citrine Yellow color.The @media query is used to maintain the same styles on smaller screens (less than or equal to 600px), ensuring the responsiveness of the design.Please replace the \'#E4D00A\' with the precise color value for citrine yellow as values can vary.To cater for various edge cases, you might want to include vendor prefixes like `-webkit-transition`, `-moz-transition`, `-o-transition` for transition property for better cross-browser support. Also ensure your HTML is in a proper format as improper nesting and closure of tags could result in style misapplication."},{"question":"I want to draw the same exact graph in R.

If an array is already sorted in ascending, then there\'s no need for us to sort it again so we just return the array. If the array is empty, just return an empty array as well.Remember that quick sort in worst-case scenario can take up to O(n²) time which can be quite bad if you select pivot as minimum or maximum of the list. However, these cases are quite rare in real world data.For the removal of duplicates, a dictionary (or a set) is used.

It uses flexbox to define the layout:```html<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>    <style>        .container {            display: flex;            height: 100vh;        }        .column {            border: solid 1px;            box-sizing: border-box;            padding: 20px;        }        .column:nth-child(1), .column:nth-child(3) {            flex: 1;        }        .column:nth-child(2) {            flex: 2;        }    </style></head><body>    <div class=\\"container\\">        <div class=\\"column\\">            <!-- Column 1 (1/4 width) -->            Content for the first column goes here.        </div>        <div class=\\"column\\">            <!-- Column 2 (1/2 width) -->            Content for the second column goes here.        </div>        <div class=\\"column\\">            <!-- Column 3 (1/4 width) -->            Content for the third column goes here.        </div>    </div></body></html>```This simple CSS/HTML code creates a 3-column layout where the 1st and 3rd columns will take up 1/4 of the width, and the 2nd column will take up 1/2 of the width. You will replace the content placeholder comments with the actual content you want in each column. The height of the columns will adjust based on the content they contain. Currently, they take up 100% of the viewport height (100vh). Note: The use of the flex-box makes it easier to achieve the layout because the widths will auto-adjust based on the `flex` property you set. The nth-child CSS selector allows us to target specific elements based on their order in the HTML structure."},{"question":"For exampleint f(int a) {   ...   return a > 10;}is that considered acceptable (not legal, I mean is it ``good code\'\'), or should it always be in a conditional, like thisint f(int a) {   ...   if (a > 10)      return 1;   else      return 0;}","answer":"Both versions are perfectly acceptable and equivalent. The choice between the two mostly comes down to personal style and readability. The first version is more concise and is generally preferred in languages where boolean expressions are interchangeable with integers (like C or C++). On the other hand, the second version is more verbose and explicit, which might make it easier to understand for some people. Moreover, the second version is preferred in languages where booleans are not interchangeable with integers (like Java or Python). In conclusion, both versions are \\"good code\\". It mainly depends on the context and personal/team coding style preferences."},{"question":"Usecase: The user makes font customizations to an object on the design surface, that I need to load/save to my datastore. I.e. settings like Bold, Italics, Size, Font Name need to persisted.Is there some easy (and reliable) mechanism to convert/read back from a string representation of the font object (in which case I would need just one attribute)? Or is multiple properties combined with custom logic the right option?","answer":"It largely depends on the complexity of your user\'s desired customisations and your programming language\'s built-in capabilities.For simple font settings like font name, size, whether it is bold or italic, you can represent it easily as a string and parse it back without too much trouble. This may be easier and less prone to error, as it involves less custom logic. For example, in the .NET framework there\'s a FontConverter class that will allow you to convert a Font object to a string and vice versa.An example string could look like \\"Arial, 12pt, Bold, Italic\\", from which your application could extract the corresponding settings.Alternatively, for more complex scenarios, you may need to store settings in separate properties/fields. These properties could include, for example, the font name, size, style (regular, bold, italic, etc.), the line spacing, kerning, and other typographic features. This would involve more custom logic and potentially storage space, but allows for a greater level of flexibility and customization.Make sure to implement necessary validations when parsing the string back to the properties to ensure data integrity and application stability.In the end, the best approach will depend on your specific needs, the complexity of the user customizations you plan to support, and the capabilities of the framework or language you\'re working in."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

In this study, six healthy adult male subjects received a single i.v. dose of [(14)C]GSK2251052, 1500 mg infused over 1 hour. Blood, urine, and feces were collected over an extended period of 14 days, and accelerator mass spectrometry was used to quantify low levels of radioactivity in plasma at later time points to supplement the less-sensitive liquid scintillation counting technique. An excellent mass balance recovery was achieved representing a mean total of 98.2% of the dose, including 90.5% recovered in the urine. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that radioactivity was moderately associated with the blood cellular components, and together with GSK2251052, both were highly distributed into tissues. The parent compound had a much shorter half-life than total radioactivity in plasma, approximately 11.6 hours compared with 96 hours. GSK2251052 and its major metabolite M3, which resulted from oxidation of the propanol side chain to the corresponding carboxylic acid, comprised the majority of the plasma radioactivity, 37 and 53% of the area under the plasma versus time concentration curve from time zero to infinity, respectively. Additionally, M3 was eliminated renally, and was demonstrated to be responsible for the long plasma radioactivity elimination half-life. A combination of in vitro metabolism experiments and a pharmacokinetic study in monkeys with the inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole provided strong evidence that alcohol dehydrogenase, potentially in association with aldehyde dehydrogenase, is the primary enzyme involved in the formation of the M3 metabolite.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"leucyl\\", \\"carboxylic acid\\", \\"[(14)C]GSK2251052\\", \\"propanol\\", \\"alcohol\\", \\"4-methylpyrazole\\", \\"GSK2251052\\", \\"aldehyde\\", \\"boron\\", \\"Boron\\", \\"(S)-3-(Aminomethyl)-7-(3-hydroxypropoxy)-1-hydroxy-1,3-dihydro-2,1-benzoxaborole\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"alcohol dehydrogenase\\", \\"aldehyde dehydrogenase\\", \\"bacterial leucyl tRNA synthetase\\"]}"},{"question":"I have data of an RCT study.

The greater the SMD, the higher the effect size. However, please note that converting a mean difference into a standardized effect size using baseline standard deviations might not be completely accurate since MMRM uses data from all time points and incorporates within-subject correlation, not just baseline.Another more advanced approach could be to standardize your differences using pooled standard deviation obtained from the root mean squared error (RMSE) of your MMRM model which take into account the variability over time and between subjects.Nevertheless, please consult with a statistician for advice that is more tailored to specific details of your study."},{"question":"Given the list [2, \'b\', \'c\', 2.5, True] containing various types of data, write a function that not only checks each element\'s data type, but also counts the occurrence of each data type in the list.","answer":"Here is a Python function that accomplishes the task:```pythondef data_type_and_count(lst):    result = {        \\"int\\": 0,        \\"float\\": 0,        \\"str\\": 0,        \\"bool\\": 0,        \\"other\\": 0    }    output = []    for element in lst:        if type(element) == int:            result[\\"int\\"] += 1            output.append((\\"int\\", element))                    elif type(element) == float:            result[\\"float\\"] += 1            output.append((\\"float\\", element))                    elif type(element) == str:            result[\\"str\\"] += 1            output.append((\\"str\\", element))        elif type(element) == bool:            result[\\"bool\\"] += 1            output.append((\\"bool\\", element))                    else:            result[\\"other\\"] += 1            output.append((\\"other\\", element))    print(\\"Data types and counts\\")    print(\\"-----------------------\\")        for key, value in result.items():        print(f\\"{key}: {value}\\")            print(\\"-----------------------\\")        print(\\"Individual data types\\")    print(\\"-----------------------\\")            for data_type, value in output:        print(f\\"{value}: {data_type}\\")data_type_and_count([2, \'b\', \'c\', 2.5, True])```This function first initializes a dictionary with keys as string representations of different data types, and values as counters initialized to 0.

The proposed solution should be integrated within a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data structure, thereby escalating the intricacy. This process must follow a methodical sequence of steps, each one incrementally refining its predecessor, to guarantee deep understanding and successful accomplishment of the task. Furthermore, the system should be architected to handle potential discrepancies and system failures, ensuring steadfast dependability. The system should also be planned to facilitate future expansion and maintenance, thereby introducing an extra layer of complexity to the task. Additionally, the system should be prepared to adjust to impending data security threats and technological progressions, introducing another level of challenge to the task.","answer":"Creating an intricate watermarking scheme using Python with a focus on the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) method includes a series of critical steps. The following is a generalized version of how it can be achieved:Please note that this scheme cannot be executed here as it requires a setup with Python libraries and dependencies. Below is the pseudo code:1. Import essential libraries:```python    import numpy as np    import cv2    import json```2. Load Image:```python    def loadImage(filepath):        img = cv2.imread(filepath, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)        return img```3. Perform DCT on Image:```python    def applyDCT(image):        return cv2.dct(np.float32(image))```4. Embed Watermark:```python    def encode(image, watermark):        transformed = applyDCT(image)        wm = np.zeros_like(transformed)        wm[watermark] = transformed[watermark]        return wm```5. Extract Watermark:```python    def decode(watermark):        return applyDCT(watermark, inverse = True)```6. Save as JSON format:```python    def save_to_json(data, filename):        with open(filename, \'w\') as file:            json.dump(data.tolist(), file)```7. Test the above functions:```python    wm = \'Hello, World!\'    img = loadImage(\'path-to-image.png\')    encodedWM = encode(img, wm)    decodedWM = decode(encodedWM)    save_to_json(decodedWM, \'watermark.json\')```This pseudo-python script first loads a grayscale image and applies the DCT method on it. Then it applies the watermark - which is merely the message \'Hello, World!\' - and lastly it saves the final watermark in a JSON file.For the case of system failures and inconsistencies, the script can be enhanced with error detection and fault tolerance routines that handle exceptions properly. For example, the image loading and DCT functions could be enclosed in try-catch blocks to handle any exceptions or errors. Secondly, backups of important stages (like after watermarking) can be preserved in case any system failure happens afterward.For foreseeable security threats, additional layers of encryption can be applied, or a more advanced watermarking algorithm or technique could be utilized. Also, the JSON file can be encrypted or stored in a secure location to maintain the credibility and privacy of watermarks.Ultimately, the system can be extended with more advanced features, such as more complex watermarking techniques, image compression and decompression before watermark embedding, using multiple watermarks, and more. Any new updates to the watermark algorithm would be done in the encode and decode functions without affecting the rest of the system. Collaboration with other systems or languages can be facilitated via the JSON data format."},{"question":"Create a HTML page with a button that changes the background color of the page when clicked.","answer":"Sure, here is a simple HTML page that changes the background color when a button is clicked.

Seven subjects underwent two incremental exercise tests on a bicycle ergometer in r and om order ; one while breathing room air ( RA ) , and the other while breathing 60 % O2 .  Maximal exercise performance was impaired in all subjects : maximal oxygen uptake ( peak VO2 ) was 56 + /- 4 % predicted ( + /- SEM ) ; and all subjects demonstrated significant arterial oxygen desaturation during exercise breathing RA ( mean 11 + /- 1 % ) . Breathing 60 % O2 during exercise result ed in a significant increase in peak VO2 ( RA : 1.32 + /- 0.05 L/min ; O2 : 1.58 + /- 0.08 L/min ; p < 0.05 ) , exercise duration ( RA : 390 + /- 21 s ; O2 : 458 + /- 24 s ; p < 0.01 ) and maximal work load ( RA : 112 + /- 6 watts ; O2 : 129 + /- 6 watts ; p < 0.005 ) . There was no significant difference in maximal minute ventilation ( VI ) achieved at the end of both tests . At matched ventilation ( 90 % peak VI from the RA test ) , respiratory frequency ( f ) was significantly higher ( RA : 33 + /- 2 breaths/min ; O2 : 35 + /- 2 breaths/min ; p < 0.05 ) , and tidal volume ( VT ) significantly lower ( RA : 1.72 + /- 0.15 L ; O2 : 1.64 + /- 0.12 ; p < 0.05 ) when subjects exercised breathing oxygen . We conclude that arterial hypoxemia significantly impairs incremental exercise performance in subjects with ILD , but that mechanisms other than arterial oxygen desaturation are responsible for the rapid , shallow breathing pattern these subjects adopt during exerciseTitle 2:Clinically important differences in the intensity of chronic refractory breathlessness.Abstract 2:CONTEXT Clinical ly important differences in chronic refractory breathlessness are ill defined but important in clinical practice and trial design . OBJECTIVES To estimate the clinical relevance of differences in breathlessness intensity using distribution and patient anchor methods . METHODS This was a retrospective data analysis from 213 data sets from four clinical trials for refractory breathlessness .  Linear regression was used to explore the relationship between study effect size and change in breathlessness score ( 0 - 100 mm visual analogue scale ) and to estimate the change in score equivalent to small , moderate , and large effect sizes . Pooled individual blinded patient preference data from three r and omized controlled trials were analyzed . The difference between the mean change in Day 4 minus baseline scores between preferred and non-preferred arms was calculated . RESULTS There was a strong relationship between change in score and effect size ( P = 0.001 ; R(2 ) = 0.98 ) . Values for small , moderate , and large effects were -5.5 , -11.3 , and -18.2 mm . The participant preference change in score was -9 mm ( 95 % CI , -15.8 , -2.1 ) ( P = 0.008 ) . CONCLUSION This larger data set supports a clinical ly important difference of 10 mm . Studies should be powered to detect this differenceTitle 3:Effects of oxygen on exercise-induced increase of pulmonary arterial pressure in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.Abstract 3:INTRODUCTION Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) is a severe disease with no known effective therapy . Patients with IPF may develop severe increase of pulmonary arterial pressure ( PAP ) on exercise , the mechanisms of which is not clearly identified . OBJECTIVES To determine whether oxygen may correct the increase of PAP developed during exercise in patients with IPF . PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed a prospect i ve study on patients with IPF and no hypoxaemia at rest . The absence of pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) at rest was confirmed by echocardiography ( systolic PAP < 35 mmHg ) . Eight patients underwent  echocardiography during exercise in air and with oxygen ( to maintain saturation of at least 94 % ) . Right ventricle-right atrium gradient and cardiac output were measured at rest , after each increment and at peak . We then compared the echocardiographic results obtained for air and oxygen . RESULTS All patients developed significant increase of SPAP on exercise ( 73 + /- 14 mmHg in air ) . Oxygen did not significantly improve SPAP on exercise ( SPAP : 76 + /- 15 mmHg ) . Echocardiographic characteristics were similar between air and oxygen except for exercise tolerance in term of workload ( p=0.045 ) and endurance ( p=0.017 ) . Resting pulmonary function tests did not predict the occurrence of increase of PAP on exercise . CONCLUSION Our results demonstrate that oxygen does not improve exercise-induced increase of PAP in patients with IPF and support the hypothesis that hypoxic vaso-constriction is not the main mechanism of acute increase of PAP during exerciseTitle 4:LONG TERM DOMICILIARY OXYGEN THERAPY IN CHRONIC HYPOXIC COR PULMONALE COMPLICATING CHRONIC BRONCHITIS AND EMPHYSEMA: Report of the Medical Research Council Working PartyAbstract 4:A controlled trial of long term domiciliary oxygen therapy has been carried out in three centres in the U.K. The 87 patients , all under 70 years of age , who took part had chronic bronchitis or emphysema with irreversible airways obstruction , severe arterial hypoxaemia , carbon dioxide retention , and a history of congestive heart failure . The patients were r and omised to oxygen therapy ( treated ) or no oxygen ( controls ) . Oxygen was given by nasal prongs for at least 15 h daily , usually at 2 1/min . The two groups were well matched , both clinical ly and in terms of lung function and other laboratory findings . 19 of the 42 oxygen  treated patients died in the five years of survival follow-up compared with 30 out of 45 controls : in the 66 men in this trial the survival advantage of oxygen did not emerge until 500 days had elapsed . Survival for the 12 female controls was surprisingly poor , 8 of them being dead at 3 years . Mortality was not easy to predict , though a summation of arterial carbon dioxide tension and red cell mass was helpful . Neither time spent in hospital because of exacerbations of respiratory failure nor work attendance were affected by oxygen therapy , but these patients were very ill at the start of the trial and many had already retired on grounds of age or ill-health . Physiological measurements suggested that oxygen did not slow the progress of respiratory failure in those who died early . However , in longer term survivors on oxygen , arterial oxygenation did seem to stop deteriorationTitle 5:Continuous or nocturnal oxygen therapy in hypoxemic chronic obstructive lung disease: a clinical trial. Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial Group.Abstract 5:At six centers , 203 patients with hypoxemic chronic obstructive lung disease were r and omly allocated to either continuous oxygen ( O2 ) therapy or 12-hour nocturnal O2 therapy and followed for at least 12 months ( mean , 19.3 months ) . The two groups were initially well matched in terms of physiological and neuropsychological function . Compliance with each oxygen regimen was good . Overall mortality in the nocturnal O2 therapy group was 1.94 times that in the continuous O2 therapy group ( P = 0.01 ) . This trend was striking in patients with carbon dioxide retention and also present in patients with relatively poor  lung function  , low  mean nocturnal oxygen saturation , more severe brain dysfunction , and prominent mood disturbances . Continuous O2 therapy also appeared to benefit patients with low mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance and those with relatively well-preserved exercise capacity . We conclude that in hypoxemic chronic obstructive lung disease , continuous O2 therapy is associated with a lower mortality than is nocturnal O2 therapy . The reason for this difference is not clearTitle 6:Symptomatic benefit of supplemental oxygen in hypoxemic patients with chronic lung disease.Abstract 6:We have compared the symptomatic benefit of air and oxygen at rest in hypoxemic patients with chronic obstructive airway disease ( COAD ) or interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) . A total of 12 severely disabled patients with COAD ( mean + /- SEM , PaO2 , 50.3 + /- 3.7 mm Hg ) and 10 with ILD ( PaO2 , 48.0 + /- 3.1 mm Hg ) received 28 % oxygen and air by Venturi face mask , each gas on two occasions , in a double-blind r and omized fashion . SaO2 increased ( p less than 0.01 ) in both groups during oxygen breathing : COAD , 85.1 + /- 2.3 % versus 93.1 + /- 1.4 % ; ILD , 85.5 + /- 1.7 % versus 94.7 + /- 0.9 % . The patients with COAD stated that air helped their breathing on 15 of 24 occasions and that oxygen helped on 22 of 24 occasions ( p less than 0.05 ) . In the patients with ILD the values were 6 of 20 and 13 of 20 occasions , respectively ( p less than 0.05 ) . In both groups of patients the severity of breathlessness recorded on a 100-mm visual analog scale was significantly ( p less than 0.05 ) lower during oxygen breathing : COAD , 29.6 + /- 4.5 versus 45.6 + /- 6.0 ; ILD , 30.2 + /- 5.1 versus 48.1 + /- 4.4 . Ventilation measured by magnetometers was significantly lower during oxygen breathing in the patients with COAD ( 8.2 + /- 1.0 versus 9.3 + /- 1.1 L/min ; p less than 0.05 ) , but the difference between oxygen and air in patients with ILD was not statistically significant ( 9.3 + /- 1.3 versus 11.2 + /- 1.6 L/min ; p greater than 0.05 ) .

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of ambulatory oxygen on dyspnea in IPF patients without resting hypoxemia but with desaturation on exertion . METHODS This was a double-blind , placebo-controlled , r and omized crossover trial of ambulatory oxygen versus ambulatory air .  Patients with IPF who had a partial pressure of arterial oxygen ( PaO2 ) between 60 mm Hg and 80 mm Hg at rest , and desaturation of 88 % or less in a room-air 6-min walk test were eligible . Patients underwent a st and ardized 6-min walk test and a 6-min free walk test under each ambulatory gas . Oxygen and air were provided at 4 L/min intranasally . Dyspnea was evaluated immediately , 1 , and 2 min after the tests . RESULTS Twenty patients ( 16 men ) , with a mean age of 73.5 ( SD 4.1 ) years , % predicted forced vital capacity ( FVC ) of 71.0 ( 13.3 ) % , % predicted diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide ( DLco ) of 57.0 ( 13.3 ) % , and PaO2 of 72.5 ( 5.4 ) mm Hg were recruited . No significant differences in dyspnea were observed between ambulatory oxygen and air at each time point . However , some patients showed improvement in dyspnea with oxygen on an individual basis . CONCLUSIONS Since oxygen provides no additional benefit over air in terms of exertional dyspnea for IPF patients without resting hypoxemia , routine prescription of ambulatory oxygen is not recommended . However , assessment on an individual basis is necessary . Trial registration .

Sequence processing and variant calling were performed using standard bioinformatics tools.Whole-exome sequencing achieved a high degree of coverage such that approximately 97% of targeted bases were represented by more than 10 base reads;AbCD is a user-friendly interface providing pre-estimated effective sample sizes, specific to each minor allele frequency category, for designs with arbitrary coverage (0.5-30×) and sample size (20-10 000), and for four major ethnic groups (Europeans, Africans, Asians and African Americans).Next generation sequencing with mean coverage of 50× using the Illumina Hi Seq and whole exome capture processing was performed.mtDNA genome coverage varied depending on the mtDNA:nuclear blend ratio, where a 1:100 ratio provided optimal dual-genome coverage with 10X coverage for over 97.5% of all targeted nuclear regions and 1,000X coverage for 99.8% of the mtDNA genome. mtDNA mutations were reliably detected to at least an 8% heteroplasmy level, as discriminated both from sequencing errors and potential contamination from nuclear mtDNA transcripts (Numts).Each sample was sequenced to a mean depth of coverage of greater than 120×Long-PCR targeting was more efficient with up to 94% of USH gene regions displaying an overall coverage higher than 25×, whereas whole exome sequencing yielded a similar coverage for only 50% of those regions.WES reads covered 91% of the target capture region (of size 37.2 MB) with an average coverage of 65×.We captured 162,073 exons of 16,954 genes and sequenced the targeted regions to a mean coverage of 56-fold.The specificity of exome enrichment was approximately 80% with 95.6% even coverage of the 34 Mb target region at an average sequencing depth of 33-foldWe generated over 4.7 GB of mappable sequence to a 125X read coverage per sample.By massively parallel sequencing of a primary hepatitis C virus-positive hepatocellular carcinoma (36× coverage) and matched lymphocytes (>28× coverage) from the same individual, we identified more than 11,000 somatic substitutions of the tumor genome that showed predominance of T>C/A>G transition and a decrease of the T>C substitution on the transcribed strand, suggesting preferential DNA repair.Whole-exome sequencing at a higher sequence depth (>76× coverage) revealed a TSC1 nonsense substitution in a subpopulation of the tumor cells.We sequenced the exomes of 1,000 Danish cases with common forms of type 2 diabetes (including body mass index > 27.5 kg/m(2) and hypertension) and 1,000 healthy controls to an average depth of 56×.We performed medium-depth (8×) whole exome sequencing in 1,000 cases with type 2 diabetes, BMI >27.5 kg/m(2) and hypertension and in 1,000 controls (stage 1)Next generation sequencing with mean coverage of 50� using the Illumina Hi Seq and whole exome capture processing was performed.","answer":"30x-60x"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

This input is an array of n integers, which dictates the order in which the string s is printed. The number at the ith index of this array suggests the position of the string in the output. For example, when given \\"Hello World!\\" as input string s, n equals 3 as number of repetitions and [2,0,1] as the order array, the program should print \\"Hello World!\\" in the order specified by the array, which is: second position, first position, third position.Please handle scenarios where the provided array might not be ordered, may contain duplicate values, or may not even have the full sequence from 0 to n-1. Your program should handle these edge cases gracefully.","answer":"Here is a Python solution that satisfies the requirements of the problem, including edge case handling.1) It ensures the array gives reasonable positions by checking if all the array elements are in the range 0 to n-1. If not, it raises a value error.2) When dealing with a provided array that might not be ordered or have repeated values, its order is not directly used to place the strings in the output. Instead, it firstly sorts a pair of the array and their indices, then prints the string according to the sorted sequence of their indices.```pythondef print_string_times(s, n, order):    # Error handling: all array values must be between 0 and n-1    if any(i<0 or i>=n for i in order):        raise ValueError(\\"All values in array must be 0 <= value < n\\")            # Create a list of tuples where each tuple is (order_value, index)    sequence = sorted((value, i) for i, value in enumerate(order))    # Output the string according to the sorted order of indices    for value, i in sequence:        print(s)# Testing the functionprint_string_times(\\"Hello World!\\", 3, [2, 0, 1])```In this example, the function would print \\"Hello World!\\" in the second position, first position, third position as the order array [2, 0, 1] specifies.Even if there were repeated values or unordered values in the order array, the function would handle this correctly and output strings in the correct order.For instance, if we call `print_string_times(\\"Hello World!\\", 3, [2, 2, 1])`, it will treat the two 2\'s as two distinct positions, because their indices in the array are different, and it will correctly print \\"Hello World!\\" in the position sequence: 2, 2, 3."},{"question":"For example, for the smoker group, a cox regression shows that the hazard rate of alcohol use on survival is 1.41. In the non-smoker group, another cox regression shows that the hazard ratio of alcohol use on survival is 1.43. How do I know if 1.41 is significantly different from 1.43? In other words, does the smoking status affect the effect of alcohol use on survival?","answer":"To determine if the hazard rates are significantly different from each other, one would typically use an interaction term in the Cox regression model between smoking status and alcohol use. An interaction term is a variable in a regression model that captures the effect of two variables interacting with each other. In this context, it would capture the combined effect of being a smoker and alcohol user on survival.If the p-value for this interaction term is less than the conventional alpha level of 0.05, this would suggest that there is a significant interaction between smoking status and alcohol use, i.e., the effect of alcohol use on survival differs significantly depending on the smoking status. However, it\'s important to note here that using just two hazard ratios like 1.41 and 1.43 and comparing them is not appropriate. It\'s the overall interaction effect in the model that needs to be considered rather than just the point estimates of the hazard ratios. Furthermore, the confidence intervals for the hazard ratios should also be taken into account when interpreting these results. Finally, this general guideline might not be 100% accurate and it highly depends on the specifics of the study design, covariates included in the model, assumptions of the Cox model being met etc. It is always advised to involve a statistician in the interpretation of such results."},{"question":"Create a SQL query that finds the average salary of employees aged between 25 and 30, grouped by their respective departments and sorted in descending order of average salary.

The SQL query would be something like this:```SQLSELECT department, AVG(salary) as Avg_SalaryFROM employeesWHERE age BETWEEN 25 AND 30 AND salary IS NOT NULL AND department IS NOT NULLGROUP BY departmentHAVING COUNT(*) > 5ORDER BY Avg_Salary DESC;```In the above query, we\'re first filtering inputs based on the given conditions (age between 25 and 30, and non-NULL salary and department values). Then we\'re grouping the results by department and calculate the average salary. We only include those groups (departments) with more than 5 employees (HAVING COUNT(*) > 5). Finally we\'re ordering the resulting departments in descending order by the calculated average salary."},{"question":"Create a Node.js function that reverses an array of characters (string), from last to first, without utilizing any intrinsic or pre-established operations.","answer":"Here\'s a solution using Node.js. The function iteratively swaps pairs of elements in the array until the resulting array is reversed.```javascriptfunction reverseArray(arr) {    let len = arr.length;    for(let i = 0; i < len / 2; i++) {        let temp = arr[i];        arr[i] = arr[len - 1 - i];        arr[len - 1 - i] = temp;     }    return arr;}console.log(reverseArray([\\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\", \\"E\\"])) // should print [\\"E\\", \\"D\\", \\"C\\", \\"B\\", \\"A\\"]```If by \\"characters (string)\\" you mean an array of strings (where each string is considered a \\"character\\"), this solution should work just fine. But if you meant to reverse an actual string, remember that strings in JavaScript are immutable. Therefore, you\'ll need to convert the string to an array, reverse it, then join the elements of the array to form a new string:```javascriptfunction reverseString(str) {    // Convert the string into an array    let arr = [];    for(let i = 0; i < str.length; i++){        arr[i] = str[i];    }    // Call the previous function to reverse the array    arr = reverseArray(arr);    // Convert the array back into a string    let reversedStr = \'\';    for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {        reversedStr += arr[i];    }    return reversedStr;}console.log(reverseString(\\"ABCDE\\")) // should print \\"EDCBA\\"```"},{"question":"Design an HTML webpage incorporating a text input field and a submit button.

Implement these features without the assistance of any libraries (like JQuery), but instead using pure JavaScript.","answer":"It\'s important to note that trying to write all of the necessary code for a fully functional HTML webpage with all the complexity you specified within this small text box would not be feasible and wouldn\'t necessarily help you understand what\'s going on.However, below is a basic outline of how to approach creating the webpage you described. First, you would create the basic HTML structure: ```html<!DOCTYPE html><html>    <head>        <title>Responsive Table</title>    </head>    <body>        <form id=\\"myForm\\">            <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"textInput\\" required pattern=\\"[A-Za-z]{3}\\">            <input type=\\"submit\\" value=\\"Submit\\">        </form>                <table id=\\"myTable\\">            <!-- table data goes here -->        </table>                <button id=\\"prev\\">Previous</button>        <button id=\\"next\\">Next</button>    </body></html>```In the \\"body\\" of your page, you have a form with a text input field that has a regular expression pattern for validation (in this case, it only allows 3 alphabetical characters), a submit button, a table where your output data will go, and \\"Previous\\" and \\"Next\\" buttons for pagination.Next for JavaScript part:```javascriptdocument.getElementById(\'myForm\').addEventListener(\'submit\', function(e) {    e.preventDefault(); // to prevent the form from being submitted normally        // code for handling input and output goes here});document.getElementById(\'prev\').addEventListener(\'click\', function(e) {    // code for handling pagination goes here});document.getElementById(\'next\').addEventListener(\'click\', function(e) {    // code for handling pagination goes here});```Building the complete table with pagination and sorting functionality completely from scratch (i.e., without using libraries like jQuery DataTables) would involve quite a lot of JavaScript code and goes beyond the scope of this question.For AJAX requests you would use `fetch`:```javascriptfetch(\'https://example.com/api/data\')    .then(response => response.json())    .then(data => {       // process data     });```Building this kind of complex system typically involves a good understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and possibly server-side programming if you\'re fetching data from an API. AJAX is a technique used for creating faster and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Please consider the solution as the basic code which you can enhance according to your requirements. This is a full scope work that requires time and learning of core concepts. The key lies in understanding each component individually, then integrating them together.

I read [this article](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/lstm-neural-networks-for-anomaly-detection-4328cb9b6e27) where [the author suggests to train the model on clean data only in response to a comment](https://medium.com/@ekorneev/good-afternoon-36ed94c2d7d4). However, in most cases, it is not possible to find and exlude anomalies manually. I had always believed that because anomalies are very rare, if we train the model on all the data then the model will learn the normal behavior of time series and be ready to detect anomalies. I have read the same notion in many other articles too. Can someone throw light on what should be right mechanism to prepare the training data for anomaly detection?","answer":"There isn\'t a definitive right or wrong approach to preparing training data for anomaly detection because of two main factors: the nature of the anomaly detection task and the balance of normal/anomalous data. For some anomaly detection cases, training on clean data might be preferable, while for others, training on all data could be beneficial.1. Nature of the task: The process to prepare the training data largely depends on the kind of anomalies you expect in the data. If the anomalies are grossly different from the normal data, then training the model on all the data may not affect the model\'s ability to detect the anomaly. However, if the anomalies are subtly different from the normal data, then training on all the data might lead the model to consider these anomalies as normal behavior, hence defeating the purpose of anomaly detection.2. Balance between normal and anomalous data: Anomalies by definition are rare, and ideally, you would want your training set to reflect the same distribution as well. If by including the anomalies, the balance in your training set is not skewed significantly, then you might be able to get away with training on all the data. One approach could be to train the autoencoder on normal data, then use the reconstruction error to create a boundary or threshold. After the model is trained, if the reconstruction error is high for a new piece of data, then that data could be considered anomalous. The reconstruction error will likely be high for anomalies, as the model hasn\'t seen this untypical data during training and thus, struggles to reproduce it accurately. This approach is also suggested in the medium article you’ve mentioned.However, regardless of these considerations, cross-validation by experimenting and running tests using different data sets (normal data, mixed data, and so on) might prove useful, as it provides empirical data on what approach suits best for your specific case."},{"question":"Develop a function that ingests a specific string alongside the length of that said string as parameters, and consequently outputs the string but in a manipulated fashion such that the ordering of the characters have been reversed. string = \\"Hello world\\"","answer":"Below is a Python solution for the problem:```pythondef reverse_string(input_str, str_length):    return input_str[str_length::-1]input_str = \\"Hello world\\"str_length = len(input_str)print(reverse_string(input_str, str_length))```When you run this code, it will output: \\"dlrow olleH\\"Explanation: The function `reverse_string` takes a string and the length of the string as input. Inside the function it returns the input string but in reverse order. The string slicing operation `input_str[str_length::-1]` is used to reverse the string where `::-1` does the work of reversing the string."},{"question":"Develop a function in Python that accepts an integer y and returns the smallest pythagorean quadruplet with a sum equal to y. Your function should also cater for negative integer values of y. The function should return a message \\"No solution\\" if it\'s impossible to find a Pythagorean quadruplet with the given sum. In addition, optimize your function to perform efficiently on large inputs of y. Apply memoization to avoid duplicate calculations where possible. Provide complexity analysis of your solution.","answer":"A Pythagorean quadruplet is a set of four positive integers a, b, c and d such that a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = d^2. For a Pythagorean quadruplet a, b, c, d, the sum a + b + c + d = y, assuming \'a\' is the smallest number then a < y/4.Here is the Python function for this problem:```pythondef pythagorean_quadruplet(y):    if y < 0:        return \\"No solution\\"    for a in range(1, int(y/4) + 1):        for b in range(a, int((y - a)/3) + 1):            for c in range(b, int((y - a - b)/2) + 1):                d = y - a - b - c                if a * a + b * b + c * c == d * d:                    return a, b, c, d    return \\"No solution\\"```The above function checks all possible quadruplets (a, b, c, d) where a, b and c are in increasing order and calculate the sum a + b + c + d to check if it equals y. The function also makes use of the condition that a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = d^2 to check if a given quadruplet is a Pythagorean quadruplet.This function has a time complexity of O(y^3) as there are three nested loops each running a fraction of \'y\' times.As for memoization, it is usually used to optimize recursive algorithms by storing results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again. In the case of this problem, it doesn\'t involve any recursion or repeated calculation with the same inputs, so it\'s not necessary to use memoization.However, optimization is possible. For a given \'a\' and \'b\', there is no need to try all possible values for \'c\' since \'c\' is fixed (because y - a - b - c = d). This leads to a considerable speedup:```pythondef pythagorean_quadruplet(y):    if y < 0:        return \\"No solution\\"    for a in range(1, y//4 + 1):        for b in range(a, (y - a)//3 + 1):            c = (y - a - b - 1)//2            d = y - a - b - c            if a*a + b*b + c*c == d*d and a<=b<=c<=d:                return a, b, c, d    return \\"No solution\\"```Now, the time complexity is O(y^2), which is a reasonable improvement over the unoptimized version."},{"question":"I recently \\"needed\\" a zip function in Perl 5 (while I was thinking about [How do I calculate relative time?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11/how-do-i-calculate-relative-time)), i.e. a function that takes two lists and \\"zips\\" them together to one list, interleaving the elements.(Pseudo)example: @a=(1, 2, 3);@b=(\'apple\', \'orange\', \'grape\');zip @a, @b; # (1, \'apple\', 2, \'orange\', 3, \'grape\');[Haskell has zip in the Prelude](http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/standard-prelude.html) and [Perl 6 has a zip operator](http://ferreira.nfshost.com/perl6/zip.html) built in, but how do you do it in an elegant way in Perl 5?","answer":"You can make use of the built-in `map` function in Perl 5 to do this in a relatively clean and efficient way:    #!/usr/bin/env perl    use strict;    use warnings;    sub zip {        my (a_ref, b_ref) = @_;        my @a = @{a_ref}; # Dereference the array refs        my @b = @{b_ref};        return map { (a[_], b[_]) } 0 .. #a;    }    my @a = (1, 2, 3);    my @b = (\'apple\', \'orange\', \'grape\');    my @zipped = zip(@a, @b); # Pass references to the arrays    print join \', \', @zipped;This version assumes both lists have the same size. If you have lists of different size and you wish to pair as long as there are elements in either array, you can slightly modify the `zip` subroutine as:    sub zip {        my (a_ref, b_ref) = @_;        my @a = @{a_ref}; # Dereference the array refs        my @b = @{b_ref};        return map { (_ < @a ? (a[_]) : ()), (_ < @b ? (b[_]) : ()) } 0 .. #a > #b ? #a : #b;    }In the example above, each array will be referenced until their last element, and the array with fewer elements will return nothing for the remaining indices.

Here is the relevant part for your purpose:The transformation from implied volatility surface to local volatility surface is implemented in file \\"ql/termstructures/volatility/equityfx/localvolsurface.hpp\\". This file contains the LocalVolSurface class (derived from LocalVolTermStructure class), which does the job. The constructor of LocalVolSurface class takes a Handle<BlackVolTermStructure> which can be an implied vol surface. You can further explore this function:```Real LocalVolSurface::localVolImpl(Time t, Real underlyingLevel) const```In this function, the actual transformation is done using Dupire\'s formula.

This tutorial assumes that your dictionary keys and values will serve as labels and size of the pie chart segments respectively. 1. Import the matplotlib library: \'import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.\'2. Define your dictionary.3. You\'ll need to separate dictionary keys and values into two separate lists. For that purpose use the following code:   ```python   labels = list(your_dict.keys())   sizes = list(your_dict.values())   ```4. Utilize the \'pie\' function from matplotlib to create the chart. Also add the \'autopct\' argument, so each piece of the pie displays its size\'s proportion to the whole. Here\'s how you might do it:   ```python   plt.pie(sizes, labels=labels, autopct=\'%1.1f%%\')   ```  5. Generally, pie charts are drawn as a circle by default. But in matplotlib, the default aspect ratio of pie charts is not 1 (which means pie is drawn as an ellipse). For a perfectly circular pie chart, you can specify \'equal\' aspect ratio by:   ```python   plt.axis(\'equal\')   ```   6. You might want to add a title for your Pie chart. Use the following function to add a title:    ```python   plt.title(\\"Your Title\\")   ```7. Finally, you can display your chart using:   ```python   plt.show()    ```Here is the whole code brought together:```pythonimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltyour_dict = {\\"key1\\": 10, \\"key2\\": 30, \\"key3\\": 50, \\"key4\\": 10}labels = list(your_dict.keys())sizes = list(your_dict.values())plt.pie(sizes, labels=labels, autopct=\'%1.1f%%\')plt.axis(\'equal\')plt.title(\\"Pie Chart from Dictionary\\")plt.show() ```This code will create a pie chart, with each segment labeled with the corresponding dictionary key and the size of each segment in proportion to the entire pie displayed as a percentage."},{"question":"I am using a QR code MFA Authentication to log in to the user using Identity.

The most that these drugs could achieve is to modify the manifestations of Alzheimer\'s disease. Cochrane reviews of each ChEI for Alzheimer\'s disease have been completed (Birks 2005, Birks 2005b and Loy 2005). Despite the evidence from the clinical studies and the intervening clinical experience the debate on whether ChEIs are effective continues. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine in people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer\'s disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group\'s Specialized Register was searched using the terms \'donepezil\', \'E2020\' , \'Aricept\' , galanthamin* galantamin* reminyl, rivastigmine, exelon, \\"ENA 713\\" and ENA-713 on 12 June 2005. This Register contains up-to-date records of all major health care databases and many ongoing trial databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: All unconfounded, blinded, randomized trials in which treatment with a ChEI was compared with placebo or another ChEI for patients with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer\'s disease. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted by one reviewer (JSB), pooled where appropriate and possible, and the pooled treatment effects, or the risks and benefits of treatment estimated. MAIN RESULTS: The results of 13 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trials demonstrate that treatment for periods of 6 months and one year, with donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine at the recommended dose for people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer\'s disease produced improvements in cognitive function, on average -2.7 points (95%CI -3.0 to -2.3), in the midrange of the 70 point ADAS-Cog Scale. Study clinicians blind to other measures rated global clinical state more positively in treated patients. Benefits of treatment were also seen on measures of activities of daily living and behaviour. None of these treatment effects are large. There is nothing to suggest the effects are less for patients with severe dementia or mild dementia, although there is very little evidence for other than mild to moderate dementia.More patients leave ChEI treatment groups, approximately 29 %, on account of adverse events than leave the placebo groups (18%). There is evidence of more adverse events in total in the patients treated with a ChEI than with placebo. Although many types of adverse event were reported, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, were significantly more frequent in the ChEI groups than in placebo. There are four studies, all supported by one of the pharmaceutical companies, in which two ChEIs were compared, two studies of donepezil compared with galantamine, and two of donepezil compared with rivastigmine. In three studies the patients were not blinded to treatment, only the fourth, DON vs RIV/Bullock is double blind. Two of the studies provide little evidence, they are of 12 weeks duration, which is barely long enough to complete the drug titration. There is no evidence from DON vs GAL/Wilcock of a treatment difference between donepezil and galantamine at 52 weeks for cognition, activities of daily living, the numbers who leave the trial before the end of treatment, the number who suffer any adverse event, or any specific adverse event. There is no evidence from DON vs RIV/Bullock of a difference between donepezil and rivastigmine for cognitive function, activities of daily living and behavioural disturbance at two years. Fewer patients suffer adverse events on donepezil than rivastigmine. AUTHORS\' CONCLUSIONS: The three cholinesterase inhibitors are efficacious for mild to moderate Alzheimer\'s disease. It is not possible to identify those who will respond to treatment prior to treatment. There is no evidence that treatment with a ChEI is not cost effective. Despite the slight variations in the mode of action of the three cholinesterase inhibitors there is no evidence of any differences between them with respect to efficacy.

Could you also elucidate the role of quantum cryptography within the architecture of secure quantum information processing, and how it can be leveraged to establish a reliable and robust security infrastructure amidst quantum information security challenges?","answer":"Quantum cryptography\'s birth can be traced back to the years right after World War II, where the paranoia of a potential nuclear attack necessitated a secure way of communicating in case of nuclear catastrophes. The study of quantum mechanics and its entanglement principle led to the understanding of the curious nature of quantum phenomena – the inability to read a quantum state without changing it. This loophole was vehemently exploited to bring forth the first robust quantum cryptography protocol, BB84, developed by Charles H. Bennett and Gilles Brassard in 1984.The BB84 protocol outlined a technique that allowed secure transmission of a key – if an eavesdropper tried to intercept, the quantum state would be altered, and the receiver could effortlessly detect this alteration. This acted as an immediate and perfect encryption key check mechanism. Further refinement of this protocol led to the development of Ekert protocol in 1991, laying down the foundations for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks, gradually evolving over the years.Over time, the practical implementation of these cryptographic protocols faced enormous challenges, such as data transmission speed, signal attenuation, and imperfections in quantum detectors, paving the way for several variants to emerge like the Differential Phase Shift Quantum Key Distribution, Continuous Variables Quantum Key Distribution, and the Coherent One-Way Quantum Key Distribution. However, the continuous monitoring and maintenance requirements of quantum cryptographic devices have posed significant challenges, including the frequent realignment of detection devices and active control of optical components. To overcome this, scientists are working towards implementing machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to automate these processes – an essential step towards a more practical and commercially-viable quantum information security system.Looking at quantum cryptography\'s integral role within the architecture of secure quantum information processing, it is used as the backbone of secure data transmission. Quantum encryption methods like QKD provide the ability to transmit keys with complete security, making it a critical link in the cycle of quantum information processing, protecting quantum information against potential quantum computing threats and ensuring a reliable security infrastructure.In conclusion, the potential hurdles, while significant, can be addressed with the development of AI-based maintenance processes, refining the encryption speeds and techniques. As quantum computing grows in prominence, the role of quantum cryptography in ensuring potent quantum information security continues to accentify, making it an indispensable part of our secure communication future. The steady progression of this science and technology can lead to its potential widespread acceptance and increase societal trust in a secure, quantum information era."},{"question":"Generate a Python code for an algorithm to find the shortest path between two points in a matrixmatrix = [[2, 3, 5], [1, 7, 6], [3, 0, 9]]start = (0, 0)end = (2, 2)","answer":"In this Python code, we use Breadth-First Search (BFS) which is a standard algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.

We will use it for API calls:```bashnpm install axios```Now, replace the code in \\"App.js\\" with the following:```jsximport React, { Component } from \'react\';import axios from \'axios\';class App extends Component {  constructor() {    super();    this.state = {      cryptos: [],    };  }  componentDidMount() {    axios.get(\'https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&order=market_cap_desc&per_page=5&page=1&sparkline=false\')      .then(res => {        const cryptos = res.data;        this.setState({ cryptos });      })  }  render() {    return (      <div>        <h1>Top 5 Cryptocurrencies</h1>        <table>          <thead>            <tr>              <th>Name</th>              <th>Current Price</th>              <th>Market Cap</th>            </tr>          </thead>          <tbody>            {this.state.cryptos.map(crypto =>              <tr key={crypto.id}>                <td>{crypto.name}</td>                <td>{crypto.current_price}</td>                <td>{crypto.market_cap}</td>              </tr>            )}          </tbody>        </table>      </div>    );  }}export default App;```This simple React app does the following:1. It uses the `componentDidMount()` lifecycle method to fetch data from the given API endpoint when the component is mounted to the DOM. This is the best place to make network requests in React.2. Once it gets the data, it updates the component state (cryptos array) which triggers re-rendering of the component.3. In the render method, it generates a table. For each cryptocurrency in the state, it creates a new row in the table. It uses the `map` function to iterate over the cryptocurrencies array and return a new array of JSX elements.4. In each row of the table, it shows the name of the cryptocurrency, its current price, and its market cap.Remember, you\'ll need to handle errors gracefully in a real-world application and also provide feedback to users when data is being fetched."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

BACKGROUND In the clinical setting , a large proportion of children with an autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) experience anxiety symptoms . Because anxiety is an important cause of impairment for children with an ASD , it is necessary that effective anxiety interventions are implemented for these children . Recently , a serious game called Mindlight has been developed that is focused on decreasing anxiety in children . This approach is based on recent research suggesting that video games might be suitable as an intervention vehicle to enhance mental health in children . In the present study it will be investigated whether Mindlight is effective in decreasing ( sub ) clinical anxiety symptoms in children who are diagnosed with an ASD . METHODS/DESIGN The present study involves a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) with two conditions ( experimental versus control ) , in which it is investigated whether Mindlight is effective in decreasing ( sub ) clinical anxiety symptoms in children with an ASD . For this study , children of 8-16 years old with a diagnosis of an ASD and ( sub ) clinical anxiety symptoms will be randomly assigned to the experimental ( N = 60 ) or the control ( N = 60 ) condition . Children in the experimental condition will play Mindlight for one hour per week , for six consecutive weeks . Children in the control condition will play the puzzle game Triple Town , also for one hour per week and for six consecutive weeks . All children will complete assessments at baseline , post-intervention and 3-months follow-up . Furthermore , parents and teachers will also complete assessments at the same time points . The primary outcome will be child report of anxiety symptoms . Secondary outcomes will be parent report of child anxiety , child/parent report of depressive symptoms , and parent/teacher report of social functioning and behavior problems . DISCUSSION This paper aims to describe a study that will examine the effect of the serious game Mindlight on ( sub ) clinical anxiety symptoms of children with an ASD in the age of 8-16 years old . It is expected that children in the experimental condition will show lower levels of anxiety symptoms at 3-months follow-up , compared to children in the control condition . If Mindlight turns out to be effective , it could be an important contribution to the already existing interventions for anxiety in children with an ASD . Mindlight could then be implemented as an evidence-based treatment for anxiety symptoms in children with an ASD in mental health institutes and special education schools .

The degree of drug-induced neutropenia resulting from a controlled trial ( UKALL I ) of treatment in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was analysed . The main agent associated with severe neutropenia was methotrexate , and methotrexate-induced neutropenia was significantly greater in patients who had received craniospinal irradiation . The synergistic toxic effect of irradiation followed by methotrexate treatment seems to have contributed to three of the five deaths which occurred in complete remission in this trial ; all deaths in remission occurred in patients who had received central nervous system prophylaxis . Analysis of patients who subsequently relapsed compared with those still in remission after 18 months of treatment indicated that the former , on average , had slightly lower neutrophil counts . This suggests that the children who relapsed did not receive any less aggressive treatment than those who remained in remission .","answer":"{\\"Intervention\\": [\\"methotrexate\\"], \\"Outcome\\": [\\"Analysis of treatment\\", \\"deaths\\", \\"remission\\", \\"methotrexate-induced neutropenia\\", \\"neutrophil counts .\\", \\"severe neutropenia\\", \\"synergistic toxic effect of irradiation\\", \\"neutropenia\\"], \\"Participant\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Monosomy of distal 1p36 represents the most common terminal deletion in humans and results in one of the most frequently diagnosed mental retardation syndromes. This deletion is considered a contiguous gene deletion syndrome, and has been shown to vary in deletion sizes that contribute to the spectrum of phenotypic anomalies seen in patients with monosomy 1p36. We report on an 8-year-old female with characteristics of the monosomy 1p36 syndrome who demonstrated a novel der(1)t(1;18)(p36.3;q23). Initial G-banded karyotype analysis revealed a deleted chromosome 1, with a breakpoint within 1p36.3. Subsequent FISH and array-based comparative genomic hybridization not only confirmed and partially characterized the deletion of chromosome 1p36.3, but also uncovered distal trisomy for 18q23. In this patient, the duplicated 18q23 is translocated onto the deleted 1p36.3 region, suggesting telomere capture. Molecular characterization of this novel der(1)t(1;18)(p36.3;q23), guided by our clinical array-comparative genomic hybridization, demonstrated a 3.2 Mb terminal deletion of chromosome 1p36.3 and a 200 kb duplication of 18q23 onto the deleted 1p36.3, presumably stabilizing the deleted chromosome 1. DNA sequence analysis around the breakpoints demonstrated no homology, and therefore this telomere capture of distal 18q is apparently the result of a non-homologous recombination. Partial trisomy for 18q23 has not been previously reported. The importance of mapping the breakpoints of all balanced and unbalanced translocations found in the clinical laboratory, when phenotypic abnormalities are found, is discussed.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

Current reforms aim to improve the efficiency of mental health care systems by increasing service integration in communities and strengthening primary mental health care. In this context, mental health care professionals (MHPs) are increasingly required to work on interdisciplinary teams in a variety of settings. Little is known, however, about the profiles of MHPs in relation to their perceived work role performance. MHPs in Quebec (N = 315) from four local service networks completed a self-administered questionnaire eliciting information on individual and team characteristics, as well as team processes and states. Profiles of MHPs were created using a two-step cluster analysis. Five profiles were generated. MHPs belonging to profiles labelled senior medical outpatient specialized care MHPs and senior psychosocial outpatient specialized care MHPs perceived themselves as more performing than MHPs in other profiles. The profile labelled low-collaborators was significantly less performing than all other groups. Two other profiles were identified, positioned between the aforementioned groups in terms of the perceived performance of MHPs: the junior primary care MHPs and the diversified specialized care MHPs. Seniority within the team, delivering specialized type of care, and positive team processes were all features associated with profiles where perceived work performance was high.

(2016) .More impressively, our trained BQNs achieve comparable log-likelihood against Gaussian Bayesian neural network (BNN) trained with stochastic gradient variational Bayes (SGVB) (Shridhar et al., 2019) (the performance of Gaussian BNNs are expected to be better than BQNs since they allows for continuous random variables).We further verify that BQNs can be easily used to compress (Bayesian) neural networks and obtain determinstic QNNs.Finally, we evaluate the effect of mean-field approximation in BQN, by comparing with its Monte-Carlo realizations, where no approximation is used.We show that our sampling-free probabilistic propagation achieves similar accuracy and log-likelihood -justifying the use of mean-field approximation in BQNs.We present a sampling-free, backpropagation-compatible, variational-inference-based approach for learning Bayesian quantized neural networks (BQNs).We develop a suite of algorithms for efficient inference in BQNs such that our approach scales to large problems.We evaluate our BQNs by Monte-Carlo sampling, which proves that our approach is able to learn a proper posterior distribution on QNNs.Furthermore, we show that our approach can also be used to learn (ensemble) QNNs by taking maximum a posterior (or sampling from) the posterior distribution.assuming g n (φ) can be (approximately) computed by sampling-free probabilistic propagation as in Section 2.However, this approach has two major limitations:(a) the Bayes\' rule needed to be derived case by case, and analytic rule for most common cases are not known yet.(b) it is not compatible to modern optimization methods (such as SGD or ADAM) as the optimization is solved analytically for each data point, therefore difficult to cope with large-scale models.(2) Sampling-based Variational inference (SVI), formulates an optimization problem and solves it approximately via stochastic gradient descent (SGD).The most popular method among all is, Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB), which approximates L n (φ) by the average of multiple samples (Graves, 2011; Blundell et al., 2015; Shridhar et al., 2019) .Before each step of learning or prediction, a number of independent samples of the model parameters {θ s } S s=1 are drawn according to the current estimate of Q, i.e. θ s ∼ Q, by which the predictive function g n (φ) and the loss L n (φ) can be approximated bywhere f n (θ) = Pr[y n |x n , θ] denotes the predictive function given a specific realization θ of the model parameters.The gradients of L n (φ) can now be approximated asThis approach has multiple drawbacks:(a) Repeated sampling suffers from high variance, besides being computationally expensive in both learning and prediction phases;(b) While g n (φ) is differentiable w.r.t. φ, f n (θ) may not be differentiable w.r.t. θ.One such example is quantized neural networks, whose backpropagation is approximated by straight through estimator (Bengio et al., 2013Our approach considers a wider scope of problem settings, where the model could be stochastic, i.e.] is an arbitrary function.Furthermore, Wu et al. (2018) considers the case that all parameters θ are Gaussian distributed, whose sampling-free probabilistic propagation requires complicated approximation (Shekhovtsov & Flach, 2018) .Quantized Neural Networks These models can be categorized into two classes: (1) Partially quantized networks, where only weights are discretized (Han et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2016) ; (2) Fully quantized networks, where both weights and hidden units are quantized (Courbariaux et al., 2015; Kim & Smaragdis, 2016; Zhou et al., 2016; Rastegari et al., 2016; Hubara et al., 2017) .While both classes provide compact size, low-precision neural network models, fully quantized networks further enjoy fast computation provided by specialized bit-wise operations.In general, quantized neural networks are difficult to train due to their non-differentiability.Gradient descent by backpropagation is approximated by either straight-through estimators (Bengio et al., 2013) or probabilistic methods (Esser et al., 2015; Shayer et al., 2017; Peters & Welling, 2018) .Unlike these papers, we focus on Bayesian learning of fully quantized networks in this paper.Optimization of quantized neural networks typically requires dedicated loss function, learning scheduling and initialization.For example, Peters & Welling (2018) considers pre-training of a continuous-valued neural network as the initialization.Since our approach considers learning from scratch (with an uniform initialization), the performance could be inferior to prior works in terms of absolute accuracy.Tensor Networks and Tensorial Neural Networks Tensor networks (TNs) are widely used in numerical analysis (Grasedyck et al., 2013) , quantum physiscs (Orús, 2014), and recently machine learning (Cichocki et al., 2016; 2017) to model interactions among multi-dimensional random objects.Various tensorial neural networks (TNNs) (Su et al., 2018; Newman et al., 2018) have been proposed that reduce the size of neural networks by replacing the linear layers with TNs.Recently, (Robeva & Seigal, 2017) points out the duality between probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) and TNs.I.e. there exists a bijection between PGMs and TNs.Our paper advances this line of thinking by connecting hierarchical Bayesian models (e.g. Bayesian neural networks) and hierarchical TNs.","answer":"We propose Bayesian quantized networks, for which we learn a posterior distribution over their quantized parameters."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Growth hormone (GH) receptor knockout (GHRKO) mice are highly insulin sensitive and long-lived. Surgical visceral fat removal (VFR) improves insulin signaling in normal mice and rats and extends longevity in rats. We have previously demonstrated decreased expression of certain pro-apoptotic genes in kidneys of GHRKO mice and suggested that this could contribute to the increased longevity of these animals. The aim of the present study was to examine the level of the following proteins: caspase-3, caspase-9, caspase-8, bax, bad, phospho-bad, bcl-2, Smac/DIABLO, Apaf-1, phospho-p53 (pp53) and cytochrome c in male GHRKO and normal (N) mice subjected to VFR or sham surgery, at approximately six months of age. The kidneys were collected two months after VFR. Caspase-3, caspase-8, bax, bad, Smac/DIABLO, Apaf-1 and pp53 levels were decreased in GHRKO mice as compared to N animals. VFR did not change the level of any of the examined proteins. The decreased renal levels of pro-apoptotic proteins could contribute to the extended life-span caused by targeted disruption of the GH receptor gene but are apparently not involved in mediating the effects of VFR.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"caspase-3\\", \\"DIABLO\\", \\"caspase-8\\", \\"Apaf-1\\", \\"bcl-2\\", \\"pro-apoptotic proteins\\", \\"pro-apoptotic genes\\", \\"Smac\\", \\"GHR\\", \\"Growth hormone (GH) receptor\\", \\"Caspase-3\\", \\"pp53\\", \\"insulin\\", \\"caspase-9\\", \\"bax\\", \\"p53\\", \\"phospho-bad\\", \\"cytochrome c\\", \\"GH receptor\\", \\"growth hormone\\", \\"phospho-p53\\", \\"bad\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

A basis for differentiation therapy of leukemias is provided by knowledge of agents which induce specific lineage maturation. All-trans retinoic acid (RA) induces differentiation of HL60 cells to neutrophils and is used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia. We observed that RA did not induced neutrophil differentiation in serum-free grown HL60 cells whereas 50 nM 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3) induced maximal monocyte differentiation. Increasing RA concentrations reduced the D3 concentration required for monocyte differentiation. Cells treated with 5 nM D3 showed little response, but differentiated maximally with 5 nM D3 and 10 nM RA. The D3 analogs MC903, EB1089 and KH1060 were more potent inducers of monocyte differentiation. The extent to which analog activity was increased after cotreatment with RA was inversely related to potency. Twenty-four hour treatment with 10 nM RA primed cells for response to 5 nM D3; the reverse sequence being ineffective. Priming with 10 nM RA, or subsequent treatment with D3 (5 nM), did not alter expression of mRNAs encoding receptors for D3 (VDR), RA (RAR alpha) or 9-CIS RA (RXR alpha, beta, gamma). That RA promotes both neutrophil and monocyte differentiation has implications for the use of RA and D3 in treatment of leukemias and provides insight into mechanisms whereby RAR, VDR and RXR facilitate monocyte differentiation.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"human promyeloid leukemia cell line\\", \\"HL60 cells\\", \\"RA primed cells\\", \\"serum - free grown HL60 cells\\", \\"HL60\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"neutrophil\\", \\"monocytes\\", \\"neutrophils\\"], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"RAR alpha\\", \\"RXR\\", \\"VDR\\", \\"receptors\\", \\"RXR alpha , beta , gamma\\"], \\"RNA\\": [\\"mRNAs\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

However, its primary locus of action remains unclear. Using a pure in vitro reconstitution system, we demonstrate that metformin acts through the v-ATPase-Ragulator lysosomal pathway to coordinate mTORC1 and AMPK, two hubs governing metabolic programs. We further show in Caenorhabditis elegans that both v-ATPase-mediated TORC1 inhibition and v-ATPase-AXIN/LKB1-mediated AMPK activation contribute to the lifespan extension effect of metformin. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of metformin regulated healthspan extension will boost its therapeutic application in the treatment of human aging and age-related diseases.Introduction:With the discovery that aging could be genetically regulated, numerous strategies have been employed to extend lifespan in model organisms, including pharmacologic and dietary interventions( Longo et al., 2015). Identification of a chemical or pharmacological manipulation that could target human aging and lower the risks associated with age-related diseases becomes a central goal of aging research. Administration of metformin, a first-line drug for treatment of type 2 diabetes( T2D), has been shown to extend lifespan in C. elegans and mice( Anisimov et al., 2008; Cabreiro et al., 2013; De Haes et al., 2014; Martin-Montalvo et al., 2013; Onken and Driscoll, 2010; Wu et al., 2016). In addition, metformin has been shown to ameliorate diabetic and cardiovascular diseases in patients( Scarpello, 2003). Metformin also lowered the incidence of several other age-related diseases, such as cancer, metabolic syndrome and cognitive disorders( Foretz et al., 2014). Due to its broad range of health benefits and little side effects, a clinical trial named TAME( Targeting Aging with Metformin) was proposed to evaluate metformin’s protective effects against human aging and age-related diseases( Barzilai et al., 2016). However, despite its intriguing benefits to promote healthy aging, the underlying mode of action of metformin is not well understood and a subject of extensive debate. Metformin is generally believed to act through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase( AMPK)( Fryer et al., 2002; Hawley et al., 2002; Zhou et al., 2001), a principal energy sensor that when activated, switches on catabolic pathways such as glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation to produce more ATP( Burkewitz et al., 2014; Hardie et al., 2012). It was proposed that metformin might act through inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport chain( ETC) Complex I( El-Mir et al., 2000; Foretz et al., 2014; Owen et al., 2000), resulting in a change of the AMP/ATP ratio and ultimately activating AMPK. However, this idea has been challenged recently( He and Wondisford, 2015), especially when physiological/low concentration( ~70 uM) of metformin, which cannot induce AMP/ATP change, is still able to activate AMPK( Cao et al., 2014). An alternative model, in which metformin activates AMPK through the lysosome-dependent pathway was proposed( Zhang et al., 2016). In this model, metformin treatment induces lysosomal localization of the scaffold protein AXIN, which brings its associated protein liver kinase B1( LKB1) to form a complex with v-ATPase-Ragulator on the surface of lysosome( Zhang et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2013). LKB1 then phosphorylates the threonine residue in the activation loop of AMPK, leading to AMPK activation( Hawley et al., 1996; Shaw et al., 2004; Woods et al., 2003). In addition to AMPK activation, metformin administration also inhibit mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1( mTORC1)( Kalender et al., 2010). mTORC1 constitutes another hub for energy and nutrient sensing, and switches on anabolism when activated( Schmelzle and Hall, 2000). The primary pathway for mTORC1 activation requires lysosome-localized Rag GTPases, which form RagA/B–RagC/D heterodimers and recruit mTORC1 to the surface of lysosome through directly binding to the Raptor subunit of mTORC1( Kim et al., 2008; Sancak et al., 2008). v-ATPase-Ragulator complex on lysosomal surface is required for the spatial regulation and activation of mTORC1 by Rag GTPases( Bar-Peled et al., 2012; Dibble and Manning, 2013; Jewell et al., 2013; Sancak et al., 2010). Two distinct mechanisms have been proposed for metformin-induced mTORC1 inhibition: suppression of Rag GTPases( AMPK-independent mechanism) or AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of Raptor( regulatory associated protein of mTORC1)( AMPK-dependent mechanism)( Howell et al., 2017; Kalender et al., 2010). Due to its short lifespan and ease of genetic manipulation, C. elegans becomes a powerful model organism to test the efficacy of metformin in promoting healthspan( Burkewitz et al., 2014). It has been shown that metformin treatment greatly extends worm lifespan and improves fitness, for example prolonging locomotory ability( Onken and Driscoll, 2010). However, several different mechanisms have been suggested for metformin’s lifespan extension effect in C. elegans. For instance, metformin administration may mimic a dietary restriction( DR) metabolism( Onken and Driscoll, 2010). In addition, alteration of methionine metabolism in C. elegans has been shown to play a partial role( Cabreiro et al., 2013). Recently, metformin has been shown to inhibit mTORC1 due to restricted transit of RagA-RagC GTPase through nuclear pore complex( NPC)( Wu et al., 2016). It is possible that these observations reflect downstream consequences of a primary action of metformin. Therefore, understanding its direct mechanism of action worth further investigation. Elucidating metformin’s mode of action will significantly boost its application to target human aging and prevent age-related diseases.Discussion:Using a pure in vitro reconstitution system that excludes mitochondria, we showed that metformin coordinates mTORC1 inhibition and AMPK activation through lysosomal pathway. We further employed genetic manipulation to show that metformin extends C. elegans lifespan and attenuates age-related fitness decline via similar mechanism that requires v-ATPase-Ragulator-AXIN/LKB1 of the lysosomal pathway( Figure 6H). Metformin may function by targeting and priming v-ATPase-Ragulator complex on lysosome membrane, which serves as a hub to coordinate mTORC1 and AMPK pathways and govern metabolic programs. It is possible that metformin administration might result in a conformational change of v-ATPase-Ragulator complex, which dissociates mTORC1 from lysosome and allows the docking of AXIN/LKB1 for AMPK activation( Figure 6—figure supplement 1). It will be of particular interest in the future to test if v-ATPase is the direct target of metformin. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of metformin-mediated lifespan extension will boost its application in the treatment of human aging and age-related diseases.","answer":"As humans are living for longer , age-related diseases – including cancer , diabetes , cardiovascular diseases and cognitive disorders – are becoming more common .

The morpheein model of allosteric regulation draws attention to proteins that can exist as an equilibrium of functionally distinct assemblies where: one subunit conformation assembles into one multimer; a different subunit conformation assembles into a different multimer; and the various multimers are in a dynamic equilibrium whose position can be modulated by ligands that bind to a multimer-specific ligand binding site. The case study of porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS) illustrates how such an equilibrium holds lessons for disease mechanisms, drug discovery, understanding drug side effects, and identifying proteins wherein drug discovery efforts might focus on quaternary structure dynamics. The morpheein model of allostery has been proposed as applicable for a wide assortment of disease-associated proteins (Selwood, T., Jaffe, E., (2012) Arch. Bioch. Biophys, 519:131-143).

Gastrosplenic fistula (GSF) is a rare condition arising from gastric or splenic lymphomas. Surgical resection is the most common treatment, as described in previous reports. We report two cases of GSF in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients that were successfully treated with chemotherapy and irradiation without surgical resection. Case 1 was of a 63-year-old man who had primary gastric DLBCL with a large lesion outside the stomach wall, leading to a spontaneous fistula in the spleen. Case 2 was of a 59-year-old man who had primary splenic DLBCL, which proliferated and infiltrated directly into the stomach. In both cases , chemotherapy comprising rituximab + dose-adjusted EPOCH regimen ( etoposide , prednisone , vincristine , cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin ) was administered . Case 1 had significant bleeding from the lesion of the stomach during the treatment cycle; however, endoscopic hemostasis was achieved. Case 2 developed a fistula between the stomach and the spleen following therapeutic chemotherapy; however, no complications related to the fistula were observed thereafter.

One of the significant differences is Swift does not have a direct equivalent of C++ \'replace\' function to replace characters. Instead, we use the \'replacingOccurrences\' method. Also, Swift does not have a specific 256 character ASCII way to count characters like C++. Instead, we make use of dictionaries to count the characters.```swiftimport Foundationfunc substituteCheckUniqueness(s: String, t: String) -> [String] {    var str = s    for c in t {        str = str.replacingOccurrences(of: String(c), with: \\"*\\")    }        var counts: [Character: Int] = [:]    for character in str {        counts[character, default: 0] += 1        if let count = counts[character], count > 1 && character != \\"*\\" {            return [str, \\"Non-unique\\"]        }    }    return [str, \\"Unique\\"]}var s = \\"hello\\"var t = \\"he\\"var result = substituteCheckUniqueness(s: s, t: t)print(\\"(result[0]) (result[1])\\")s = \\"world\\"t = \\"o\\"result = substituteCheckUniqueness(s: s, t: t)print(\\"(result[0]) (result[1])\\")s = \\"substitution\\"t = \\"s\\"result = substituteCheckUniqueness(s: s, t: t)print(\\"(result[0]) (result[1])\\")```In this Swift code:- `s` and `t` are the strings passed into the `substituteCheckUniqueness` function.- Each character in `t` is replaced with an \'*\' in `s`.- `counts` is a dictionary that stores the amount of each character in `s`.- Each character in `s` is checked for counts. If a character count is over 1 and it\'s not an \'*\', it returns `s` and \\"Non-unique\\".- If no characters are over 1 (except for \'*\'), it returns `s` and \\"Unique\\".- The main part of the code calls the `substituteCheckUniqueness` function multiple times with different `s` and `t` inputs, printing the results."},{"question":"Within the framework of a Convolutional Neural Network architecture encompassing M layers, utilizing ReLU activation functions and Cross-Entropy loss, and assuming suitable hyper-parameters and initialization are established, could you elaborate on the viable tactics to avert the predicament of overfitting? Could you probe further into the potential implications these methodologies might impose on the model\'s proficiency and its predictive prowess? Furthermore, can you furnish a sequential, logical procedure to elucidate the functioning of these overfitting countermeasures, while concurrently considering the impacts on computational resources and the time complexity of the algorithm?","answer":"Overfitting in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a common predicament where the model learns the noise in the training data to an extent that hinders its ability to generalize from unseen data. Here are several methods to reduce overfitting, their potential impacts, and proceedings:1. Data Augmentation: This approach increases the amount of training data by augmenting them via several methods like flipping, cropping, rotation, etc. More varied data helps the model generalize better. However, the running time will increase depending on the augmentation techniques used, potentially requiring extra computational resources.2. Dropout: It randomly nullifies a proportion of neurons (i.e., their contribution to forward and backward propagations) in the training phase, which discourages co-adaptation of features, hence reducing overfitting. While it moderately increases computational time, it does not significantly affect the training speed or require extra memory.3. Early Stopping: This strategy involves stopping the training process if the model’s performance starts degrading on the validation set, effectively stopping overfitting in its tracks. It may, however, prematurely stop the training process.4. Regularization (L1/L2): It imposes a cost on the complexity of the model, discouraging learning a more complex model and thereby aiding in generalization. It does not significantly influence computational requirements or time complexity.5. Batch Normalization: It standardizes the inputs to a layer for each mini-batch, making the network less sensitive to the initial weights. It can offer some regularization effect by adding a bit of noise to each hidden layer\'s activations. Though this technique might increase training time slightly, it usually also helps in faster convergence.6. Ensembling: This technique combines predictions from several models, reducing the variance. However, it requires running multiple models simultaneously, resulting in increased computational requirements and running time.It\'s also important to monitor the model\'s performance on a held-out validation set during training. This provides insights into when the model starts overfitting so that you can counteract it accordingly.Lastly, it\'s important to note that there\'s no one-size-fits-all method to address overfitting. Depending on the dataset\'s nature and the specific task, different combinations of the aforementioned techniques might be needed. It requires a multitude of experimentation and experience to choose the most suitable combination."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

The pass through the unsorted portion of the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The current implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm you presented has a time complexity of O(n^2) where n is the number of elements in the list. Thus, it\'s not the most efficient sorting algorithm, especially for large data sets. However, one optimization can be done to improve the Bubble Sort algorithm by skipping the next passes once the list becomes sorted:```pythondef bubble_sort_optimized(lst):    for i in range(len(lst)-1):        is_sorted = True        for j in range(len(lst)-1-i):            if lst[j] > lst[j + 1]:                lst[j], lst[j + 1] = lst[j + 1], lst[j]                is_sorted = False        if is_sorted: break     return lst```In this optimized version, a flag is introduced to check if the list has become sorted before the algorithm has technically finished iterating through the list as many times as there are elements. If it becomes sorted, we \'break\' out of the loop, thus saving unnecessary iterations.Although it must be noted, the worst-case and average complexity of this optimized bubble sort still remains O(n^2) because, in worst scenarios, this optimization won\'t help. Nonetheless, it might help in some cases and add a bit of efficiency. For large lists of items, more efficient sorting algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, or HeapSort should be used which have O(n log n) average and worst-case complexity."},{"question":"In Python using Keras, design a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for the IMDB dataset and include a sequence to sequence model for text generation.

Furthermore, model performance can be further enhanced by adding more LSTM or Dense layers, tuning the LSTM neuron counts, fiddling with the batch size, dropout rates (both input and recurrent) or epochs.Also note that the problem of overfitting can be further mitigated by using techniques like early stopping or by increasing the dropout rates in our LSTM layers.Please note that this code has been provided as an essence, however, because of lack of complete info on model performance like precision, recall etc., or plotting capabilities for ROC and Precision-Recall curves, please add those as per your respective requirements."},{"question":"Write a CSS code snippet to add a drop shadow to the <p> element with a blur radius of 10 px. Additionally, make sure that the shadow is only visible on the right and bottom sides of the element, and it should not transition smoothly on hovering over the element.","answer":"You can achieve this effect in CSS using the `box-shadow` property. Here is how you can do it:```cssp {  position: relative;  box-shadow: 8px 8px 10px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* horizontal offset, vertical offset, blur radius, spread radius and color */  transition: none; /* Disables any transition effect when hovering */}```This CSS snippet applies a drop shadow to all `<p>` elements. The `8px` horizontal offset means the shadow will be 8px to the right of the element, giving the illusion it\'s only on the right side. Similarly, the `8px` vertical offset positions the shadow 8px below the element.The `10px` blur radius blurs the shadow so it smoothly transitions from dense to light, creating a realistic effect, and `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)` sets the shadow to a light black color using RGBa (alpha) color values.By setting `transition: none`, it will disable any transition effect that might be applied when hovering over the element. If there are other transitions you want to keep, you can replace `none` with the properties you do not want to transition, e.g., `transition: box-shadow none;`."},{"question":"Please help me clean up this Python code, it\'s an output from an OCR scan.innp0rt sympydef pro<ess_values(lst, n]:try:# (h3cking 1f n is betvveen 2 and 1O0if nOt (2 <= r c- 10O):retvrn =1pn1nnes = list(sympy,prinerang3(2` n + 1))_h g€t71ng prines up to mabs_vals = [4bs(int(1)) for l im_lst if in7(i) == l and al1(int(i) % p f0n p in primes)]_# fil+er1ng 4n0 ge7+ing 4bs_valsnesul+ - 1for abs va1 in abz val:result *= abs v&l h multiplvin9_ab5 valu3sretvrm r€svltekcept Ekception as e:# retvrn_an ennor me5s&9€retvrn \\"An error oc(urred: \\" + tr(e)print[pr0(ess ualve5([2, -E,_5. 9, 17]. 7)) # retvnms: 51pnint(procesz v&lves((1.5` 4,8, -2.2, G.5], 5)} H retunns: 7qrint(proc3ss_vaiu3z((I, =5, 9, -3, 11, 2e], 13)) #_r€turns: 7s9prir7(pro(ess values((3.2, -2.7` 0, T, 13, 2I), A}] # r3turns: 09r1nt(proces_valu3s([-1.7, 2, 2, 1i, 13, 31], 12]) # r€tvrns: 37129E","answer":"Here\'s the cleaned up version of your Python code:```pythonimport sympydef process_values(lst, n):    try:        # checking if n is between 2 and 100        if not (2 <= n <= 100):            return -1        primes = list(sympy.primerange(2, n + 1))  # getting primes up to n        abs_vals = [abs(int(i)) for i in lst if int(i) == i and all(int(i) % p for p in primes)]  # filtering and getting abs_vals        result = 1        for abs_val in abs_vals:            result *= abs_val  # multiplying abs values        return result    except Exception as e:        # return an error message        return \\"An error occurred: \\" + str(e)print(process_values([2, -3, 5, 9, 17], 7))  # returns: 51print(process_values([1.5, 4,8, -2.2, 6.5], 5))  # returns: 7print(process_values([1, -5, 9, -3, 11, 20], 13))  # returns: 759print(process_values([3.2, -2.7, 0, 7, 13, 21], 8))  # returns: 0print(process_values([-1.7, 2, 2, 11, 13, 31], 12))  # returns: 37128```Please note that:1.

The proposed strategy should exhibit superior efficiency, considering aspects such as space complexity, scalability, and the capacity to handle unconventional situations. Furthermore, the strategy should necessitate a stratified analytical methodology to guarantee an exhaustive understanding of the problem. The resolution must also be adept in managing outlier scenarios and non-standard inputs without compromising its efficacy. This assignment demands a multi-tiered rational approach to ensure the resolution\'s resilience and adaptability.","answer":"To attain an optimal strategy, we have to augment the Red-Black tree to maintain size information about subtrees. The \'size\' information represents the number of descendants a node has, including itself. It necessitates adjusting the Red-Black tree insertion and deletion functions accordingly to keep the \'size\' information accurate. With this information, we can efficiently identify the kth largest element with a time complexity of O(log n). Here is a step-by-step strategy:1. Root Selection: Start from the root of the Red-Black tree.2. Size Calculation: If the size of the node’s right child plus 1 is ‘k,’ this node is the kth largest value. This is because the node\'s right subtree comprises values greater than the node, and since we are looking for the kth ‘largest’ value, we need to search in the right subtree.3. Right Subtree: If the size of the right child is larger than \'k\', apply the same process recursively on the right subtree. 4. Left Subtree: If the size of the right child is smaller than \'k\', apply the process recursively on the left subtree, but reduce the value of \'k\' by the (size of the right child + 1), because those nodes will be greater than any node in the left subtree.5. Repeat: Repeat the process described in steps 2-4 until you find the kth largest value. The algorithm efficiently achieves the target with O(log n) time complexity due to 2 balances: the tree\'s self-balancing property and keeping track of the \'size\' in each node. Space complexity is O(log n) since the algorithm doesn\'t need any extra space besides the space for the recursive stack.This strategy caters for outlier scenarios due to its recursive nature, allowing it to deal with large values of \'k\' or non-standard inputs, without affecting its time complexity since the search space is constantly halved at every step. However, it is crucial to ensure that \'k\' doesn’t exceed the total number of nodes present in the tree, or else an immediate error should be returned. To thoroughly understand the problem, stratified analytical research using a multi-tiered rational approach can be implemented. This systematically analyses each aspect of the problem, enhancing the resolution\'s resilience and adaptability. This process involves analyzing the base problem, dissecting use cases, simulating potential input scenarios, and crafting an efficient strategy accordingly. The advantage of implementing this approach is that it significantly reduces the likelihood of encountering unforeseen complications in problem-solving scenarios."},{"question":"Design an algorithmic process that concurrently calculates the lateral surface area and volume of diverse frustum categories, including a truncated conical frustum, an elliptical-based frustum, and a frustum with non-homogeneous cross-sections. This process should integrate the radii of the two distinct circular bases, the major and minor radii of the elliptical bases, the slant height, and a function outlining the base\'s form at any given altitude as input parameters, utilizing the established mathematical formula for ascertaining the surface area and volume of a frustum. The process should be proficient in handling multiple frustums simultaneously, accepting a collection of frustums each defined by their individual radii, major and minor radii, slant height, and base shape function. The process should produce a collection of the lateral surface areas and volumes corresponding to each frustum in the input collection. The process should also be prepared to manage invalid inputs, such as negative radii or altitudes, by producing an appropriate error message. The process should be optimized for efficiency, with a time complexity not surpassing O(n^2 log n), where n symbolizes the number of frustums in the input collection. Furthermore, the process should be adept at handling floating point precision issues and should provide accurate results up to a precision of 15 decimal places. The process should be prepared to handle large inputs, with the number of frustums in the input collection reaching up to 10^7.

Return a list of all words that are palindromes. Implement this without using any built-in functions for string reversal or manipulation.

Could you provide a comprehensive analysis of the distinct benefits and potential competitive edge this approach might offer, particularly in terms of scalability, cost-effectiveness, and maintenance?","answer":"Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda function offers multiple benefits when used to deploy and orchestrate web applications. Here are some of the key advantages you can look forward to:1. Highly Scalable: AWS Lambda service operates with a robust and flexible autoscaling feature. This means your application will be able to respond instantly to variations in traffic. When your application needs more resources, it automatically scales up, and when the load decreases, it scales down. This elasticity ensures the performance of your app and user experience are consistently maintained.2. No Server Management: AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service. This means you don\'t have to worry about server management, setup, maintenance, or capacity provisioning. AWS will manage all the infrastructure needed to run the code. This allows you to focus solely on writing and optimizing your application\'s code, enhancing productivity.3. Cost-Effective: With Lambda, you pay only for the compute time you consume. There\'s no charge when your code isn\'t running, which means you don\'t need to pay for idle server capacity. Also, AWS calculates the cost based on the actual execution time, rounding it up to the nearest 100ms, which leads to a great reduction in total computation costs.4. Reliable and Secure: AWS Lambda automatically operates your applications and services through AWS\'s high-availability data centers. This provides robust and reliable architecture for your applications. Additionally, AWS supplies data protection and encryption for your data at rest and in transit, ensuring a high level of security.5. Event-Driven Computation: AWS Lambda can be configured to respond to service events (e.g., changes to data in an Amazon S3 bucket, updates to a DynamoDB table). This enables easy automation of updates or responses to events, thereby, freeing up time for other tasks. 6. Continuous Scaling: As your workload grows, AWS Lambda can be set up to work in parallel, processing each trigger individually. This eliminates the need for a separate queuing or batching process and makes it ideal for high-volume processing.7. Integrated Compliance Validations: Lambda functionality meets several compliance standards like EU-VAT, Singapore MTCS, and SOC, reducing excessive auditing and ensuring stability in your application development process.While these are some of the major strengths of AWS Lambda, do bear in mind that it might take some time to get used to working with AWS\'s console or the commands with terminal or cmd. However, it does offer a competitive edge in terms of scalability, cost, security, and the amount of maintenance required."},{"question":"I\'m trying to decide on a language training model for my code. and I wanted to know what aspects and elements should I take into consideration before picking one of them?I understand that for larger data it is preferred to use an LSTM model, but what about Word2Vec? when it\'s better to choose it over the LSTM model?thank you for your help.","answer":"Choosing between the LSTM and Word2Vec models (or any other models) for a language training task greatly depends on the specific objectives of your project. Here are some factors to consider:1. Your Task Type: Word2Vec produces word embeddings, converting words into vectors that capture their meanings based on surrounding context in the dataset. Its purpose is to understand the semantic and syntactic similarity between words. It\'s great for tasks like synonym finding, analogy solving, and text classification. On the other hand, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network that excels in understanding sequential information. If your task is related to understanding the context of entire sentences, paragraphs or documents such as text generation or machine translation, LSTM will be a preferred choice.2. Size and Type of Your Dataset: If your dataset consists of a large number of small documents (tweets, comments etc), Word2Vec could perform better. But if you have longer texts and your goal is to understand context over a longer span within those texts, LSTM would be a better choice. Also, LSTMs can handle larger datasets better than traditional RNNs due to their architecture.3. Training Time and Computational Resources: Training LSTMs usually takes more time and computational resources (memory and processing power) than training Word2Vec because LSTM needs to backpropagate through all timesteps. Meanwhile, Word2Vec\'s training involves predicting context words from a target word (or vice versa) for each word in your training corpus, which is much faster and more memory-efficient.4. Interpretability: Word2Vec generates a numerical vector for each word which allows words with similar meanings to be clustered together in the vector space. You can intuitively understand and visualize the relationships between words. LSTM, on the other hand, is a type of neural network and its operations are harder to interpret intuitively.5. Pre-Trained Models: There are many pre-trained models available for both Word2Vec and LSTM which can be used depending on the task. Using a pre-trained model can save a lot of time as these models are usually trained on a large amount of data.6. Combination of Models: It\'s also worth noting that LSTM and Word2Vec can be used together. Word2Vec can be used to create word embeddings which can then be fed into an LSTM network. This can bring benefits from both techniques.Always consider experimenting with different types of models and configurations to find what works best for your specific use case and data."},{"question":"Construct a strategy which manipulates the supplied alphanumeric string, transforming it into its corresponding hexadecimal representation in computer science.","answer":"Here\'s a Python script that would solve this problem.

All the hex values are then joined together into a single string with \'join\'. You can try running this script with different input strings to see the corresponding hexadecimal outputs. This script assumes that Python 3 is used and does not handle any potential errors that may occur if some characters are not encodable in Unicode or hexadecimal.Also note that converting string to the hexadecimal representation means translating each character into corresponding ASCII value and this ASCII value is hexadecimal.

The collections.Counter operation has a linear time complexity, i.e., O(n) where n is the length of the string. Therefore, the overall time complexity would be O(nlogn + n).The space complexity is O(n) because we are storing the frequencies of all distinct characters from the string. This can be at most the size of the string if all characters are unique. This code is fairly efficient for small to medium-sized strings. For large strings with many unique characters, the sorting can become a bottleneck. Nonetheless, sorting is necessary in this case because we have a requirement to sort the characters not only by frequency but also alphabetically. There are ways to optimize the sorting by using bucket sorting or similar algorithms for integers, but this would only work if we have a fixed range of characters (such as ASCII) and doesn\'t apply to the given problem which includes many types of characters. Furthermore, unless the size of the string is very large, these kinds of optimizations would not offer a noticeable performance benefit."},{"question":"Refactor the code given below to be more challenging.

Its constitutive expression on resting and activated T cells precludes it from being a bona fide exhaustion marker. By breeding Pmel-1 mice with SLAMF6-/- mice, we generated donors for T cells lacking SLAMF6 and expressing a transgenic TCR for gp100-melanoma antigen. Activated Pmel-1xSLAMF6-/- CD8+ T cells displayed improved polyfunctionality and strong tumor cytolysis. T-bet was the dominant transcription factor in Pmel-1 x SLAMF6-/- cells, and upon activation, they acquired an effector-memory phenotype. Adoptive transfer of Pmel-1 x SLAMF6-/- T cells to melanoma-bearing mice resulted in lasting tumor regression in contrast to temporary responses achieved with Pmel-1 T cells. LAG-3 expression was elevated in the SLAMF6-/- cells, and the addition of the LAG-3-blocking antibody to the adoptive transfer protocol improved the SLAMF6-/- T cells and expedited the antitumor response even further. The results from this study support the notion that SLAMF6 is an inhibitory immune receptor whose absence enables powerful CD8+ T cells to eradicate tumors.Introduction:The SLAM family of receptors( SFRs) is a set of six receptors expressed on hematopoietic cells( Wu and Veillette, 2016; Cannons et al., 2011; Veillette, 2010; Calpe et al., 2008). All SFRs, except 2B4, are homotypic binders, that is they engage the same ectodomain sequence, either in cis( same cell) or in trans( adjacent cell) configuration. Most hematopoietic cell types express 3–5 members of the SLAM family. SFRs generate signals via a bi-phasic mechanism of recruitment to tyrosines in the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motifs( ITSMs) in their cytoplasmic domain. SLAM associated protein( SAP), a small protein containing the Src homology 2( SH2)-domain, was shown to be the default adaptor of the SFRs, interchanging with protein tyrosine phosphatases, mainly SHP-1, but also SHP-2, inositol phosphatase SHIP-1 and protein tyrosine kinase Csk( Wu and Veillette, 2016; Cannons et al., 2011; Veillette, 2010; Calpe et al., 2008). SLAMF6, also known as CD352, LY108, or NTB-A, is a homotypic SFR expressed on T cells, NK cells, B cells, and dendritic cells( Bottino et al., 2001; Zhong and Veillette, 2008). Kageyama et al. linked SLAMF6 to the anchoring of T cells to their target cells, and subsequent cytolysis of the target( Kageyama et al., 2012). According to these authors, functional SAP is critical for SLAMF6 activity. In mice lacking SAP, SLAMF6 was shown to inhibit T cell function( Kageyama et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2012; Bottino et al., 2001). The role of SLAMF6 in healthy T cells expressing normal SAP levels was generally inferred from contextual data and is not yet clear. There are indications that SLAMF6 plays an activating role in double-positive thymocytes( Dutta et al., 2013) along with evidence that it plays an inhibitory role in iNKT cells and CD8+ T cells( Lu et al., 2019; Eisenberg et al., 2018). Gene expression profiles of T cell subsets link SLAMF6 to the progenitor-exhausted state( Miller et al., 2019) and to the tuning of the critical number of T cells required for proper differentiation( Polonsky et al., 2018). To elucidate the net function of SLAMF6, we generated a transgenic mouse with the Pmel-1 melanoma-specific T-cell receptor( TCR) expressed in CD8+ T cells, in which the SLAMF6 gene was knocked out. In this report, we show for the first time that SLAMF6-/- CD8+ T cells display improved anti-melanoma activity and prevent melanoma growth more effectively than CD8+ T cells with intact and functional SLAMF6. Since SLAMF6 is constitutively expressed on T cells, it acts as an inhibitory checkpoint receptor whose absence allows the eradication of established tumors by CD8+ T cells.Discussion:The aim of this study was to characterize the role of SLAMF6 in CD8+ T cells, in the context of an antitumor response. The data obtained identify SLAMF6 as a receptor whose absence significantly improves CD8+-mediated tumor regression, suggesting that it is an inhibitory checkpoint. Historically, SFRs were studied for their part in X-linked lymphoproliferative disease( XLP), a complex genetic immune dysfunction caused by a SAP mutation. XLP is characterized by a compromised immune response to Epstein-Barr virus( EBV) but also by unrestrained T lymphoblast proliferation, which is not necessarily EBV-induced. Thus, it is unclear whether loss of SAP converts all SFRs into ‘super-inhibitory’ receptors or whether, on the contrary, loss of SAP unleashes lymphocytes to proliferate, free from re-stimulation-induced apoptosis( Katz et al., 2014; Kageyama et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2012; Bottino et al., 2001). Since SAP is an adaptor common to all SLAM family receptors, the role of each individual receptor was obscured by the shared defect. In this situation, SLAMF6 was considered a receptor with a dual function, depending on the interplay between SAP and SHP-1 and SHP-2, protein phosphatases that bind to tyrosines on the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor( Veillette, 2010; Cannons et al., 2011; Detre et al., 2010). SLAMF6 duality was echoed in data from Veillette that showed differing effects of SLAMF6 on NK cells, enhancing function in the priming phase while suppressing cells in the effector-phase( Wu et al., 2016). Also, mice lacking individual SFRs exhibit minor immune deviations( Wu and Veillette, 2016; Cannons et al., 2011; Veillette, 2010; Calpe et al., 2008). In the past, we described that targeting SLAMF6 with its soluble ectodomain yielded CD8+ T cells that do not need IL-2 supplementation, either in vitro or in vivo, to eradicate established melanoma( Eisenberg et al., 2018). The beneficial effect of the soluble ectodomain of SLAMF6 prompted us to generate melanoma-specific SLAMF6-/- T cells, to characterize the role of the receptor in a solid tumor model. A key finding using the new Pmel-1 x SLAMF6-/- mice described in this manuscript is the absence, in fact, of a dichotomy in SLAMF6 action in effector T cells. On the contrary, knocking-out SLAMF6 in murine antigen-specific CD8+ T cells disclosed an unequivocal inhibitory role for the receptor. In its absence, TCR triggering of anti-melanoma CD8+ T cells yielded a strong effector phenotype, higher IFN-γ secretion, improved cytolysis, and better outcomes in the adoptive transfer of SLAMF6-/- anti melanoma CD8+ T cells to treat established melanoma. This study identifies SLAMF6 as a powerful inhibitor of antitumor immune response. The absence of viable SAP in SLAMF6-/- lymphocytes hints that this adaptor takes a major part in the inhibitory effect of SLAMF6. To explore the role of SLAMF6 in T cells without the confounding effects of its function in other cell types, we generated a system in which effector T cells interact with their tumor target based on specific epitope recognition and subsequently generate an immunological synapse. The synapse is a subcellular structure involved in the effect of SLAMF6 and is crucial for its study( Zhao et al., 2012). However, although we revealed the inhibitory effect of SLAMF6 in the Pmel-1 x SLAMF6-/- mice, the source and configuration of SLAMF6/SLAMF6 homotypic binding in the wild-type situation were still difficult to characterize. We had to generate a SLAMF6-positive B16-F10/mhgp100 melanoma line to measure the effect, or more exactly, the degree of suppression, that SLAMF6 trans-activation has on the capacity of melanoma-cognate CD8+ T cells to eradicate tumors. As shown( Figure 2E), the SLAMF6-expressing melanoma suppressed T cell efficacy and consequently grew faster. This observation received further support from similar data generated with peptide-pulsed thymoma cells transduced to express SLAMF6( Figure 5C). However, the improved IFNγ secretion of SLAMF6-/- T cells, when co-cultured with SLAMF6-lacking APCs compared to WT APCs, implies that an inherent mechanism, most likely lack of cis-inhibition in the antigen presenting cells, is also responsible for the effect( Figure 5A). The molecular mechanisms underlying the increased functional capacity of Pmel-1 T cells lacking SLAMF6 have common features with XLP, as the absence of SAP implies. But while XLP is a global defect of all cell types of the immune system, and therefore yields mixed derangements, the absence of SLAMF6 is remarkable for the enhanced functionality of CD8+ T cells, in which it is the dominating SFR. The transcriptional landscape of SLAMF6-/- T cells was governed by the higher expression of T-bet. T-bet is a transcription factor that contributes to Th1 and Th17 phenotypes in CD4 T cells. T-bet is prevalent in cytolytic innate lymphocytes residing in tissues and B cells of mouse strains prone to autoimmunity( Plank et al., 2017; Nixon and Li, 2018). The increased activity of T-bet in SLAMF6-/- CD8+ T cells implies that T-bet-regulated pathways may operate in CD8+ T cells in the absence of functioning SLAMF6, generating ‘type 1’ inflammatory traits and high cytotoxicity. The improved production of IFN-γ and GM-CSF, in parallel with reduced IL-10 and IL-13, is also typical for type one phenotypes. SLAMF6 should be distinguished from typical exhaustion markers because it is expressed on CD8+ T cells, regardless of their state of activation. Yigit et al. suggested that blocking SLAMF6 using an antibody can correct the exhaustion phase of T cells( Yigit et al., 2019), but we favor the notion that SLAMF6 hampers T cells at any stage, as reflected from the functional superiority of short-term activated Pmel-1 T cells. Depleting SLAMF6 improved CD8+ T cells in the short and long-term, as was most evident when the WT Pmel-1 cells induced the regression of melanoma only for a limited period while the Pmel-1 x SLAMF6-/- cells led to lasting responses in mice( Figure 4H). While searching for new immunotherapeutic targets, the field of immunotherapy is moving to combination therapies, and to biomarker-based treatment choices, to target the escape mechanisms used by tumors. From the results presented here, we conclude that SLAMF6 is an important checkpoint receptor with a significant inhibitory effect on T cells. The balance between SLAMF6 and LAG-3, and the enhancing effect of LAG3 blocking suggests that targeting both may have a valuable combinatorial, and perhaps even a synergistic, effect( Figure 6G–I). In summary, we have shown that SLAMF6 is a constitutive inhibitory immune receptor; in its absence, CD8+ T cells acquire stronger reactivity against tumor cells. The strong effector trait is attributed to a series of T-bet-mediated transcriptional events that drive CD8+ T cells to exert strong cytotoxicity and achieve long-lasting tumor control. SLAMF6 is an attractive target for the development of checkpoint inhibitors for systemic treatment of cancer and for the improvement of antitumor cellular therapies.","answer":"The immune system helps to protect our bodies from illnesses and infections .

Contemplate how it influences components\' interaction, code security and the ease of debugging.","answer":"Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming, along with abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. It refers to the bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit called an object.Here are the benefits of using encapsulation:1. Code Modularity and Readability: Encapsulation makes the code modular and more readable. You get to decide which data should be exposed and which should be hidden. A module with encapsulated data is much easier to understand for other developers as well, because they deal with a well-defined interface, not the object\'s internals.2. Enhanced Security: Encapsulation provides a way to protect your data from accidental corruption. By hiding the object\'s internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through its methods, you can ensure that the object stays in a valid state. In essence, an object controls its internal data, preventing unauthorized access and manipulation.3. Ease of Debugging: With encapsulation, bugs are more localized to a particular component or method. By breaking down the system into encapsulated objects, you define clear boundaries and interfaces between components, reducing the system\'s overall complexity. If a bug occurs, it\'s much easier to pinpoint where the error is happening.4. Reduced Impact of Changes: Encapsulation allows for flexible system updates. If you need to change how an object implements its functionality, you can do so without affecting other parts of your program. This is because other components don\'t depend on the object\'s internal implementation; instead, they interact with the object through its methods (this is also called loose coupling).5. Reusability: Encapsulated objects and components can be reused effectively in different parts of the program, or even in other programs, reducing the amount of duplicated code. Reusable code is generally more maintainable since any modifications only need to be done in a single place.In the context of a programming problem, encapsulation would be implemented by defining classes or data structures, each with their own methods and private variables. All interactions between these objects would then be done using these methods, without directly accessing the internal data. This would provide all the aforementioned benefits and demonstrates the power and utility of the encapsulation concept in object-oriented programming."},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

We set up a retrospective study using nasal swabs collected by sentinel GPs from ILI patients in 2011 and 2012. A total of 250 swabs were randomly selected and analyzed by multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) including research of 18 viruses and 4 bacteria. We detected respiratory viruses in 169/222 (76.1%) samples, mostly rhinovirus (23.4%), influenza A virus (21.2%), influenza B virus (12.6%), coronavirus (4.9%) and Human metapneumovirus (3.6%). Nine swabs (5.3% of positive swabs) revealed co-infections with two viruses identified, among which six concerned co-infections with influenza viruses. We observed important seasonal differences, with circulation of Human Metapneumoviruses, RSV A and B and coronavirus only during summer; whereas parainfluenza viruses were identified only during winter. In conclusion, this study highlights a substantial circulation of multiple respiratory pathogens in Réunion Island throughout the year. It shows that ILI are not only attributable to influenza and underlines the need for biological surveillance. As the use of multiplex RT-PCR showed its efficacy, it is now used routinely in the surveillance of ILI. Text: Influenza like-illness (ILI) or acute respiratory infections can be caused by several types of respiratory viruses or bacteria in humans [1] . Influenza viruses, Respiratory Syncytial viruses (RSV) and Parainfluenza viruses are identified as major viruses mostly responsible for ILI and pneumonia in several studies [2] . However practitioners cannot diagnose the infection without a biological test confirmation. Unfortunately, these infections causes are identified in less than 50% [3] . Réunion Island, a French overseas territory with 850,000 inhabitants, is located in the southern hemisphere between Madagascar and Mauritius in the Indian Ocean (Latitude: 21°05.2920 S Longitude: 55°36.4380 E.). The island benefits from a healthcare system similar to mainland France and epidemiological surveillance has been developed by the regional office of the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance (Cire OI), based on the surveillance system of mainland France [4] . Influenza activity generally increases during austral winter, corresponding to summer in Europe [5] . Since 2011, influenza vaccination campaign in Reunion Island starts in April  and the vaccine used corresponds to World Health Organization recommendations for the southern hemisphere. Since 1996, clinical and biological influenza surveillance has been based on a sentinel practitioner\'s network [6] . In 2014, this network was composed of 58 general practitioners (GPs) spread over the island and represented around 7% of all Réunion Island GPs. Nasal swabs are randomly collected all along the year and are tested by RT-PCR for influenza viruses. Among these surveillance samples, 40 to 50% are tested positive for influenza A virus, A(H1N1)pdm09 or B virus by the virological laboratory of the University Hospital Center of Réunion. Thus ILI samples tested negative for influenza are of unknown etiology. Several biological tools allow identifying respiratory pathogens from nasal swab. In recent years, multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been developed to identify several viruses simultaneously [7] [8] [9] [10] . We therefore used this new method to set up a retrospective study using swabs collected by sentinel GPs from 2011 to 2012. The main objective of our study was to characterize respiratory pathogens responsible for ILI consultations in sentinel GPs in 2011 and 2012. Secondary objectives were to highlight seasonal trends on respiratory pathogens circulation and to describe occurrence of co-infections, especially during the flu season. ILI was defined as a sudden onset of fever more than 38 degrees Celsius and cough, associated or not with other symptoms such as breathing difficulty, headache, etc. Every week, all GPs of the sentinel network were encouraged to collect a nasal swab from the first two patients who presented ILI since less than three days. After being tested for influenza viruses, the 994 swabs collected in 2011 and 2012 are frozen at -80°C at the university hospital center (CHU) laboratory. Based on the budget, a season-stratified sample of 250 swabs was randomly selected in order to describe circulating viruses including outside flu season. Random sampling was performed with Excel 1 using the anonymized surveillance database of the Cire OI. The sampling frame contained identification number of swab assigned by Cire OI, laboratory identification number, sex, age, date of onset of symptoms, date of swab collection and result of influenza RT-PCR. We used Respifinder 1 Smart 22 kits a multiplex RT-PCR (PathoFinder, Maastricht, The Netherlands) which can detect 22 respiratory pathogens. This assay is based on the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) technology. The reverse transcription and preamplification steps were performed on the epgradient Mastercycler 1 (Eppendorf) and the hybridization, ligation and detection steps on the LightCycler 1 480 system (Roche Applied Science). This method was chosen because of its high specificity, compared to other same methods (78% versus 33%) [3, 11] . Multiplex analysis allows for rapid production of diagnostic results. It thus allows highlighted the possible presence of eighteen respiratory viruses and four bacteria in one reaction by melt curve analysis: Influenza A not (H1N1 Statistical analyses were performed with Stata 1 and Excel 1 . Two seasons were defined to identify possible seasonal trends in circulation of the viruses: winter season during weeks 23 to 39 between June and September and summer season during the rest of the year. Data and swabs result from a surveillance system that received regulatory approvals, including the CNIL (National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties Number 1592205) approval in July 2012. All the patients have received oral information and gave their consent for swab and data collection. Data were collected for surveillance purpose and are totally anonymous. Among the 250 randomly-selected swabs, 26 were not available anymore as they were sent to Influenza Reference Center for confirmation and characterization of the pathogenic agent. According to the sensitivity of the assay two samples could be discordant results between Influenza PCR initially realized and Multiplex PCR. Thus they were deleted from the analysis: one is positive for Influenza in singleplex and negative for all tested pathogens in multiplex and one is positive for Influenza in singleplex and positive for PIV2 in multiplex. In total, 222 analyses were considered. Moreover, 53 samples were negative for all analyzed respiratory pathogens (23.9%) and 169 samples had at least one detected pathogen (76.1%), finally a total of 178 pathogens was identified. During the study period, a minority of the weeks (21 i.e. 20%) did not include any sampled swab, mainly outside flu season. Patients\' sex-ratio was 0.63 (86 men and 136 women) and mean age was 28.4 years [min 0; max 81]. Ten percent had less than 5 years, 24% 5-15 years, 63% 15-65 years and only 3% were 65 and older. The respiratory pathogens most frequently identified in ILI swabs were rhinovirus (23.4%), influenza A not H1N1 (21.2%) and influenza B (12.6%) ( Table 1) . Among the 22 respiratory pathogens tested by the multiplex, only three were not found in any analyzed sample: Parainfluenza3, Legionella pneumophila and Bordetella pertussis. Regarding co-infections, nine swabs revealed the presence of two viruses, among which6 involved influenza viruses (Table 2) . Analyses showed that some viruses are possibly seasonal and were circulating during a specific period of the year. They are detected only in summer for Human Metapneumovirus, RSV A and B, and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. For the latter, it is specific to the studied period since the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus reappeared in Réunion Island in October 2012 and was no longer circulating since late 2010. On the opposite, Parainfluenza 1,2 and 4 viruses were identified only in winter. For other pathogens, no specific period of detection was observed. A weekly description of samples was realized to study the distribution of respiratory pathogens in 2011 and 2012 (Fig 1) . Results of biological analyses were compared with data of ILI consultations declared by sentinel GPs in 2011 and 2012. We observed in 2011, after a first wave in June mainly due to influenza A not H1N1 virus, a second wave of ILI consultations with mainly identification of Parainfluenza viruses and not influenza viruses. In 2012, the second epidemic wave at the end of austral winter coincided with Influenza viruses and Rhinovirus circulation. Regarding negative swabs (Fig 2) , we observed no seasonality during the study period with a similar proportion whatever the season. This retrospective study based on a sentinel GPs network showed that not only influenza viruses are responsible for ILI consultations. Indeed, an important circulation of multiple pathogens was observed throughout the year, with 12 different types of pathogens identified in 2011 and 2012. Respiratory viral pathogens were present in 76.1% of samples, which is largely above results from annual influenza surveillance [12] . After influenza viruses, Rhinovirus and Coronavirus were the most common respiratory viruses in Réunion Island. Although samples were not taken every week, sample was representative of ILI activity and consistent with flu season. Nevertheless, according to the low number of samples, it is difficult to conclude about seasonality. However in our study, RSV was circulating in summer season which is hot and rainy, which is confirmed by other studies in tropical region [13] . This study also highlighted several co-infections, showing that concomitant the multiple etiology of ILI. Co-circulation was already observed in Réunion Island during the A(H1N1) pdm09 pandemic in addition to influenza virus, with identification of other respiratory viruses such as Rhinovirus or Coronavirus [14] . In mainland France, during this pandemic, circulation of major respiratory viruses was found, such as Rhinovirus, Parainfluenza, Coronavirus, Human Metapneumovirus, like in our publication [15] [16] . In our study, only 5.3% of positive swabs were co-infections whereas in two studies in Madagascar co-infections represented 27.3% and 29.4% [17] [18] . Despite the distance of 9,300 km between Réunion and France, the island is directly connected to Europe with four daily flights to France. These exchanges can impact respiratory pathogens circulation in southern and northern hemisphere. Results of this study can therefore be of interest to both Indian Ocean and Europe countries. Among the 148 swabs initially negative for influenza because not previously tested for any other viruses, the study found an etiology for 95 swabs. In total, only 53 swabs, representing 24% of the sample, remained without etiology with negative multiplex PCR results all along the year. Multiple hypotheses can explain this result: a poor quality of swabs, preventing from identifying a pathogen, noninfectious causes or other pathogens not included in the multiplex PCR. However, we couldn\'t test the negative swabs for RNAse P, a marker of human cells, which could provide a modicum of assurance that the swab contained human cells. Concerning the two samples divergent for influenza identification between the multiplex and singleplex PCR, we discarded them for the analysis; one was positive in Influenza with singleplex and positive in PIV with multiplex. It could be a false positive result from singleplex. Indeed, as the multiplex PCR assay has a good sensitivity and is considered as a gold-standard, we decided to keep seven negative results for Influenza in singleplex and positive in Influenza in multiplex [7] [8] [9] [10] . No case of Bordetella pertussis which causes whooping cough and Legionella pneumophila which causes Legionnaires\' disease was identified in this study. However, these diseases are rare in Réunion Island, around three cases of Legionnaires\' disease are declared each year. A limit of the study is that no clinical data were available in the virological surveillance system of influenza in Réunion Island. It was impossible to compare clinical symptoms according to each pathogen and to know if there are different pathogens which cause for instance rhinitis, laryngitis or bronchitis (diseases included in ILI). A specific prospective study including clinical data might provide useful elements in the semiotics of diseases. In conclusion, this study highlighted an important circulation of multiple pathogens in Réunion Island throughout the year. It shows that ILI is not specific to influenza and so it is essential to have biological results in order to establish the differential diagnosis and thus explain the etiology of symptoms. For a better understanding of respiratory pathogens circulating in Réunion Island, information from this study may also be useful to practitioners who see many patients in consultation with ILI. As the use of multiplex RT-PCR showed its efficacy in the ILI surveillance and allowed to highlight the circulation of other viruses and bacterial causes of respiratory infections, it is now used routinely in the surveillance of ILI. Moreover, it would be interesting to repeat this study every 3 or 5 years adding clinical data to monitor the evolution of respiratory pathogens in Réunion Island over time.Question: When does the  influenza vaccination campaign in Reunion Island start?","answer":"April"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper. Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: An epithelial-centric alarmin pathway around IL-25, IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and their interaction with group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) has also recently been identified (Nagarkar et al., 2012; Hong et al., 2018; Allinne et al., 2019) . IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP  are type 2 inflammatory cytokines expressed by the epithelial cells upon injury to the epithelial barrier (Gabryelska et al., 2019; Roan et al., 2019) . ILC2s are a group of lymphoid cells lacking both B and T cell receptors but play a crucial role in secreting type 2 cytokines to perpetuate type 2 inflammation when activated (Scanlon and McKenzie, 2012; Li and Hendriks, 2013) . In the event of viral infection, cell death and injury to the epithelial barrier will also induce the expression of  , with heighten expression in an inflamed airway (Allakhverdi et al., 2007; Goldsmith et al., 2012; Byers et al., 2013; Shaw et al., 2013; Beale et al., 2014; Jackson et al., 2014; Uller and Persson, 2018; Ravanetti et al., 2019) . These 3 cytokines then work in concert to activate ILC2s to further secrete type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 which further aggravate the type 2 inflammation in the airway causing acute exacerbation (Camelo et al., 2017) . In the case of COPD, increased ILC2 activation, which retain the capability of differentiating to ILC1, may also further augment the neutrophilic response and further aggravate the exacerbation (Silver et al., 2016) . Interestingly, these factors are not released to any great extent and do not activate an ILC2 response during viral infection in healthy individuals (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018a) ; despite augmenting a type 2 exacerbation in chronically inflamed airways (Jurak et al., 2018) . These classical mechanisms of viral induced acute exacerbations are summarized in Figure 1 . As integration of the virology, microbiology and immunology of viral infection becomes more interlinked, additional factors and FIGURE 1 | Current understanding of viral induced exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Upon virus infection in the airway, antiviral state will be activated to clear the invading pathogen from the airway. Immune response and injury factors released from the infected epithelium normally would induce a rapid type 1 immunity that facilitates viral clearance. However, in the inflamed airway, the cytokines and chemokines released instead augmented the inflammation present in the chronically inflamed airway, strengthening the neutrophilic infiltration in COPD airway, and eosinophilic infiltration in the asthmatic airway. The effect is also further compounded by the participation of Th1 and ILC1 cells in the COPD airway; and Th2 and ILC2 cells in the asthmatic airway. Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www.frontiersin.org mechanisms have been implicated in acute exacerbations during and after viral infection (Murray et al., 2006) . Murray et al. (2006) has underlined the synergistic effect of viral infection with other sensitizing agents in causing more severe acute exacerbations in the airway. This is especially true when not all exacerbation events occurred during the viral infection but may also occur well after viral clearance (Kim et al., 2008; Stolz et al., 2019) in particular the late onset of a bacterial infection (Singanayagam et al., 2018 (Singanayagam et al., , 2019a . In addition, viruses do not need to directly infect the lower airway to cause an acute exacerbation, as the nasal epithelium remains the primary site of most infections. Moreover, not all viral infections of the airway will lead to acute exacerbations, suggesting a more complex interplay between the virus and upper airway epithelium which synergize with the local airway environment in line with the \\"united airway\\" hypothesis (Kurai et al., 2013) . On the other hand, viral infections or their components persist in patients with chronic airway inflammatory disease (Kling et al., 2005; Wood et al., 2011; Ravi et al., 2019) . Hence, their presence may further alter the local environment and contribute to current and future exacerbations. Future studies should be performed using metagenomics in addition to PCR analysis to determine the contribution of the microbiome and mycobiome to viral infections. In this review, we highlight recent data regarding viral interactions with the airway epithelium that could also contribute to, or further aggravate, acute exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Patients with chronic airway inflammatory diseases have impaired or reduced ability of viral clearance (Hammond et al., 2015; McKendry et al., 2016; Akbarshahi et al., 2018; Gill et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Singanayagam et al., 2019b) . Their impairment stems from a type 2-skewed inflammatory response which deprives the airway of important type 1 responsive CD8 cells that are responsible for the complete clearance of virusinfected cells (Becker, 2006; McKendry et al., 2016) . This is especially evident in weak type 1 inflammation-inducing viruses such as RV and RSV (Kling et al., 2005; Wood et al., 2011; Ravi et al., 2019) . Additionally, there are also evidence of reduced type I (IFNβ) and III (IFNλ) interferon production due to type 2-skewed inflammation, which contributes to imperfect clearance of the virus resulting in persistence of viral components, or the live virus in the airway epithelium (Contoli et al., 2006; Hwang et al., 2019; Wark, 2019) . Due to the viral components remaining in the airway, antiviral genes such as type I interferons, inflammasome activating factors and cytokines remained activated resulting in prolong airway inflammation (Wood et al., 2011; Essaidi-Laziosi et al., 2018) . These factors enhance granulocyte infiltration thus prolonging the exacerbation symptoms. Such persistent inflammation may also be found within DNA viruses such as AdV, hCMV and HSV, whose infections generally persist longer (Imperiale and Jiang, 2015) , further contributing to chronic activation of inflammation when they infect the airway (Yang et al., 2008; Morimoto et al., 2009; Imperiale and Jiang, 2015; Lan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2016; Kowalski et al., 2017) . With that note, human papilloma virus (HPV), a DNA virus highly associated with head and neck cancers and respiratory papillomatosis, is also linked with the chronic inflammation that precedes the malignancies (de Visser et al., 2005; Gillison et al., 2012; Bonomi et al., 2014; Fernandes et al., 2015) . Therefore, the role of HPV infection in causing chronic inflammation in the airway and their association to exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases, which is scarcely explored, should be investigated in the future. Furthermore, viral persistence which lead to continuous expression of antiviral genes may also lead to the development of steroid resistance, which is seen with RV, RSV, and PIV infection (Chi et al., 2011; Ford et al., 2013; Papi et al., 2013) . The use of steroid to suppress the inflammation may also cause the virus to linger longer in the airway due to the lack of antiviral clearance (Kim et al., 2008; Hammond et al., 2015; Hewitt et al., 2016; McKendry et al., 2016; Singanayagam et al., 2019b) . The concomitant development of steroid resistance together with recurring or prolong viral infection thus added considerable burden to the management of acute exacerbation, which should be the future focus of research to resolve the dual complications arising from viral infection. On the other end of the spectrum, viruses that induce strong type 1 inflammation and cell death such as IFV (Yan et al., 2016; Guibas et al., 2018) and certain CoV (including the recently emerged COVID-19 virus) (Tao et al., 2013; Yue et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2020) , may not cause prolonged inflammation due to strong induction of antiviral clearance. These infections, however, cause massive damage and cell death to the epithelial barrier, so much so that areas of the epithelium may be completely absent post infection (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2019) . Factors such as RANTES and CXCL10, which recruit immune cells to induce apoptosis, are strongly induced from IFV infected epithelium (Ampomah et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2019) . Additionally, necroptotic factors such as RIP3 further compounds the cell deaths in IFV infected epithelium . The massive cell death induced may result in worsening of the acute exacerbation due to the release of their cellular content into the airway, further evoking an inflammatory response in the airway (Guibas et al., 2018) . Moreover, the destruction of the epithelial barrier may cause further contact with other pathogens and allergens in the airway which may then prolong exacerbations or results in new exacerbations. Epithelial destruction may also promote further epithelial remodeling during its regeneration as viral infection induces the expression of remodeling genes such as MMPs and growth factors . Infections that cause massive destruction of the epithelium, such as IFV, usually result in severe acute exacerbations with non-classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Fortunately, annual vaccines are available to prevent IFV infections (Vasileiou et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2018) ; and it is recommended that patients with chronic airway inflammatory disease receive their annual influenza vaccination as the best means to prevent severe IFV induced exacerbation. Another mechanism that viral infections may use to drive acute exacerbations is the induction of vasodilation or tight junction opening factors which may increase the rate of infiltration. Infection with a multitude of respiratory viruses causes disruption of tight junctions with the resulting increased rate of viral infiltration. This also increases the chances of allergens coming into contact with airway immune cells. For example, IFV infection was found to induce oncostatin M (OSM) which causes tight junction opening (Pothoven et al., 2015; Tian et al., 2018) . Similarly, RV and RSV infections usually cause tight junction opening which may also increase the infiltration rate of eosinophils and thus worsening of the classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases (Sajjan et al., 2008; Kast et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2018) . In addition, the expression of vasodilating factors and fluid homeostatic factors such as angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) and bactericidal/permeabilityincreasing fold-containing family member A1 (BPIFA1) are also associated with viral infections and pneumonia development, which may worsen inflammation in the lower airway Akram et al., 2018) . These factors may serve as targets to prevent viral-induced exacerbations during the management of acute exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Another recent area of interest is the relationship between asthma and COPD exacerbations and their association with the airway microbiome. The development of chronic airway inflammatory diseases is usually linked to specific bacterial species in the microbiome which may thrive in the inflamed airway environment (Diver et al., 2019) . In the event of a viral infection such as RV infection, the effect induced by the virus may destabilize the equilibrium of the microbiome present (Molyneaux et al., 2013; Kloepfer et al., 2014; Kloepfer et al., 2017; Jubinville et al., 2018; van Rijn et al., 2019) . In addition, viral infection may disrupt biofilm colonies in the upper airway (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae) microbiome to be release into the lower airway and worsening the inflammation (Marks et al., 2013; Chao et al., 2014) . Moreover, a viral infection may also alter the nutrient profile in the airway through release of previously inaccessible nutrients that will alter bacterial growth (Siegel et al., 2014; Mallia et al., 2018) . Furthermore, the destabilization is further compounded by impaired bacterial immune response, either from direct viral influences, or use of corticosteroids to suppress the exacerbation symptoms (Singanayagam et al., 2018 (Singanayagam et al., , 2019a Wang et al., 2018; Finney et al., 2019) . All these may gradually lead to more far reaching effect when normal flora is replaced with opportunistic pathogens, altering the inflammatory profiles (Teo et al., 2018) . These changes may in turn result in more severe and frequent acute exacerbations due to the interplay between virus and pathogenic bacteria in exacerbating chronic airway inflammatory diseases (Wark et al., 2013; Singanayagam et al., 2018) . To counteract these effects, microbiome-based therapies are in their infancy but have shown efficacy in the treatments of irritable bowel syndrome by restoring the intestinal microbiome (Bakken et al., 2011) . Further research can be done similarly for the airway microbiome to be able to restore the microbiome following disruption by a viral infection.Question: Which are the type 2 inflammatory cytokines expressed by the epithelial cells upon injury to the epithelial barrier?","answer":"IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

International university partnerships can promote such a perspective through the strengthening of cooperation, exchange, and communication between academic institutions across national boundaries. As an example for such an academic network in the field of public health, we introduce the International Public Health Partnership -a collaboration between a university in Germany and universities in India, Turkey, and Nigeria. Formed in 2005, it facilitated the exchange of information, fostered discussion about the transferability of public health concepts, contributed to the structural development of the universities involved, and promoted an intercultural dialog through a combination of local and distance learning activities. Although well accepted by students and staff, different obstacles were encountered; these included limited external funding, scarce own financial, time and personnel resources, and diverging regulations and structures of degree programs at the partnership sites. In the present article, we share several lessons that we learned during our joint collaboration and provide recommendations for other universities that are involved in partnerships with institutions of higher education or are interested to initiate such collaborations.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"interested\\", \\"learned\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [\\"field of public health\\"], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"obstacles\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"public health\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"intercultural dialog\\", \\"structures of degree programs\\", \\"article\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [\\"universities\\", \\"university\\", \\"University\\", \\"academic\\", \\"International Public Health Partnership\\", \\"partnership\\", \\"partnerships\\", \\"Partnerships\\"], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"students\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [\\"staff\\"], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"global\\", \\"Germany\\", \\"external\\", \\"Turkey\\", \\"Nigeria\\", \\"local\\", \\"sites\\", \\"India\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You are presented with multiple paper abstracts, alongside the associated literature review and chapter titles.

Let G be a graph. The following assertions are equivalent: 1. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  We introduce q-proper interval graphs as interval graphs with interval models in which no interval is properly contained in more than q other intervals, and also provide a forbidden induced subgraph characterization of this class of graphs. We initiate a graph-theoretic study of subgraphs of q-proper interval graphs with maximum clique size k+1 and give an equivalent characterization of these graphs by restricted path-decomposition. By allowing the parameter q to vary from 0 to k, we obtain a nested hierarchy of graph families, from graphs of bandwidth at most k to graphs of pathwidth at most k. Allowing both parameters to vary, we have an infinite lattice of graph classes ordered by containment. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  Abstract Many problems involving DNA can be modelled by interval families. However, traditional interval graphs do not take into account the repeat structures of a DNA molecule. We propose a new definition that respects repeats and define loop graphs as the intersection graphs of arcs of a loop. The class of loop graphs contains the class of interval graphs, and the class of circular-arc graphs. Every loop graph has interval number 2. We characterize the trees that are loop graphs. The characterization yields a polynomial-time algorithm which given a tree decides whether it is a loop graph and in the affirmative case, it produces a loop representation for the tree.Literature Review:","answer":"(iii) G contains no induced claw, net, tent, or C n for any n ≥ 4.

Since 0-proper interval graphs are exactly the proper interval graphs, these graph classes generalize the class of proper interval graphs. For each positive integer k, let T k be the graph obtained by adding k − 1 true twins to the vertex of degree 3 of K BIB003 BIB001 . For instance, the graph T 1 is exactly the claw.

Concurrent administration of indinavir and didanosine significantly reduces the level of exposure to indinavir, but it is unclear how soon after didanosine administration indinavir may be given safely. We compared indinavir pharmacokinetics and gastric pH in 12 human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients by use of 800 mg of indinavir alone versus 800 mg of indinavir administered 1 h after didanosine administration. Median gastric pH was significantly higher when indinavir was taken after didanosine administration; however, no significant difference in the maximum concentration in plasma or the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 8 h was observed. Indinavir may be taken with a light meal 1 h following the administration of 400 mg of didanosine.","answer":"{\\"Brand\\": [], \\"Drug\\": [\\"Indinavir\\", \\"indinavir\\", \\"didanosine\\", \\"IDV\\"], \\"DrugGroup\\": [], \\"UnapprovedDrug\\": []}"},{"question":"<table-wrap><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>NS5B Mutant Inhibition Parameters for Derivative 2aa</title></caption><table><colgroup><col/><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr>\\t<th>binding site</th>\\t<th>NS5B mutant</th>\\t<th>IC50 (μM)</th>\\t<th>fold change</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr>\\t<td>PSI</td>\\t<td>M414T</td>\\t<td>127.7 ± 5.5</td>\\t<td>29.7</td></tr><tr>\\t<td>TSI</td>\\t<td>P495L</td>\\t<td>5.1 ± 0.3</td>\\t<td>1.2</td></tr><tr>\\t<td>TSII</td>\\t<td>M423T</td>\\t<td>9.3 ± 1.5</td>\\t<td>2.2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><label>a</label><p>The IC50 values were evaluated against the indicated NS5B mutants as described for the wild-type NS5B and represents an average ± SD of two independent experiments in duplicate.

It should return \\"false\\" and error code for numbers not divisible by 3.","answer":"Here is a basic implementation of such a function in C. This code defines a C function named is_divisible_by_3. If the number is divisible by 3, it will return 1 (corresponding to true) and update the variable pointed by quotient_ptr. If the number is not divisible by 3, it returns 0 (corresponding to false) and sets the error code to -1.It assumes that quotient_ptr and error_code_ptr are pointer to an int, and must be non-null. You need to pass addresses of int variables when you call the function.Also, please note that in C there is no boolean type so integer values 0 (for false) and 1 (for true) are typically used.```c#include <stdio.h>int is_divisible_by_3(int num, int *quotient_ptr, int *error_code_ptr){    if (num % 3 == 0)    {        *quotient_ptr = num / 3;        return 1; // true    }    else    {        *error_code_ptr = -1;        return 0; // false    }}int main() {    int quot, err_code;    int num = 9; // Replace with the number you want to check    if(is_divisible_by_3(num, &quot, &err_code)) // if true    {         printf(\\"Number is divisible by 3, quotient is: %dn\\", quot);    }    else // not divisible by 3    {        printf(\\"Number is not divisible by 3, error code is: %dn\\", err_code);    }    return 0;}```You can replace the \'num\' with the number you want to check and run the program.

Your tests must include, but are not limited to, edge cases, testing the individual functions used in your model, and the model\'s overall performance evaluation.8. Evaluate the performance of the model using the root mean square error (RMSE) and R-squared metrics.","answer":"Mathematical Model:We\'re using Multivariate Linear Regression, a technique used to predict the output of a continuous value, like a price, relative to multiple input parameters. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + ... + bn*xn + eWhere,- y is the target variable that we want to predict;- b0...bn are the regression coefficients;- x1,x2...xn are the input variables; - and e is the residual error.The error should ideally be minimal, and that would signify a good fit of the model.Python Implementation:```pythonimport numpy as npimport pandas as pdfrom scipy import statsfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_splitfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScalerfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score# load dataset and splitdf = pd.read_csv(\'data.csv\')x = df.drop([\'target_column\'], axis=1)y = df[\'target_column\']x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)# handling missing valuesdf = df.fillna(df.mean())# feature scalingsc = StandardScaler()x_train = sc.fit_transform(x_train)x_test = sc.transform(x_test)# multivariate linear regressionx_train = np.column_stack((np.ones(len(x_train)), x_train))x_test = np.column_stack((np.ones(len(x_test)), x_test))theta = np.linalg.inv(x_train.T.dot(x_train)).dot(x_train.T).dot(y_train)# cost functionh = x_train.dot(theta)cost = (1/(2 * len(y_train))) * np.sum((h - y_train)2)# predictionx_unseen = sc.transform(np.array([unseen_values]))x_unseen = np.insert(x_unseen, 0, 1)y_pred_unseen = x_unseen.dot(theta)# model evaluationy_pred_test = x_test.dot(theta)rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_test))r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred_test)```In this code block,1. We first load the dataset and split it into training and test data.2. We handle missing values by filling them with the mean of the respective column.3. We perform feature scaling so that all the features are on the same scale.4. For regression, we add an additional column of ones to the inputs, compute the θ values using the normal equation.5. We calculate the cost function.6. For prediction on unseen data, we first transform it using the same scaler, add a 1 to its start, and then compute the predicted result using θ.7. To evaluate the model, we predict the y values for x_test, and then compute the RMSE and R².Justification of using Multivariate Linear Regression: Multivariate linear regression was used as it is a relatively simple yet powerful model that can be applied to predict outcomes based on multiple features. The given problem involves predicting a continuous dependent variable from multiple independent variables, making a multivariate linear regression model highly suitable."},{"question":"Design an algorithm to search for specific words within two separate sentences, including any that may be missing or extra in either one. Sentence A = \\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\\" Sentence B = \\"The quick dog jumps over the lazy fox.\\"","answer":"The first step is to convert these sentences into sets of words. Then, we can simply use set operations to find the differences between them.Here\'s a Python algorithm for this problem:```pythondef find_extra_missing_words(sentence_a, sentence_b):    words_a = set(sentence_a.split())    words_b = set(sentence_b.split())        extra_in_a = words_a - words_b    extra_in_b = words_b - words_a        print(\\"Extra words in sentence A: \\", extra_in_a)    print(\\"Extra words in sentence B: \\", extra_in_b)sentence_a = \\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\\"sentence_b = \\"The quick dog jumps over the lazy fox.\\"find_extra_missing_words(sentence_a, sentence_b)```This script first separates the sentences into individual words, then puts these words into sets (which automatically remove any duplicates). It then subtracts the set of words in Sentence B from the set in Sentence A to find any words that are in A but not in B, and vice versa. These are printed out as the \\"extra\\" words in the respective sentences.Note: This script assumes words are separated by spaces and punctuation is not part of the word. If you have sentences with punctuation attached to the words or words separated by characters other than spaces, you need to modify the sentence splitting logic accordingly. If capitalization matters, you\'ll want to convert all words to lower or upper case before putting them into sets."},{"question":"Create a function in R that will return the maximum number and second maximum number in a given vector along with the indices of their first occurrences. Additionally, the function should handle edge cases, including vectors with duplicate elements and an empty vector as input. If the maximum and second maximum numbers are equal, return the higher index.vec <- c(3,2,5,1,4,0,5,2,4)","answer":"You can solve this problem in R programming by using the `max()` function to find the maximum number in a given vector and then eliminate this maximum number from the initial vector and perform `max()` function again to find the second maximum number in R programming.Here is the code:```Rmax_secondmax <- function(vec) {  if(length(vec)==0)    return(\\"The vector is empty\\")    max_first <- max(vec)  max_first_index <- which(vec == max_first)[1]    vec <- vec[-max_first_index]    if(length(vec)==0)    return(paste(\\"The maximum number is\\", max_first, \\", and its index is\\", max_first_index, \\".

If yes, it will return `\'The vector is empty\'`. If not, it will find the maximum number and remove its first occurrence from `vec`. Then it will find the second maximum number. If `vec` becomes empty after removing the maximum number, that means the vector contains only one element, and there is no second maximum number. Thus, it will return a message to notify this situation. Otherwise, it will return the maximum number and the second maximum number along with the indices of their first occurrences. Remember the `which()` function gives the positions of `TRUE` the logical object, so the returned indices start from 1."},{"question":"Formulate code in the Ruby programming language that accurately quantifies the volume of elements present within a distinct array of integer values.

Then we count the number of elements in the \'unique_arr\' and return this count.The code ensures that even if duplicates, 0s and negative numbers are part of the array, they will be counted as a single (i.e., unique) volume.

Before then, I used Matlab.For the Matlab case, I wrote commands to make the matrix in the for loop, as follows:`for i=1:1:100; k(i,:)=i.^2; end`I typed the same commands in Julia, but it didn\'t work.Furthermore, I tried other commands as follows:n=100;k = Array{Int64, n};for i in 1:n;    k[i]= i;end;However, the error happened as follows:MethodError: no method matching setindex!(::Type{Array{Int64, 10}}, ::Int64, ::Int64)How to make a matrix in for loop in Julia?","answer":"In Julia, if you want to preallocate an array of zeros that you\'ll populate later (as is common in MATLAB), you\'ll use the `zeros` function. Here\'s the translation of your MATLAB script to Julia, which creates a 100-element column vector with the squares of the numbers 1 through 100:```julian = 100k = zeros(n)for i in 1:n    k[i] = i^2end```You can make it more idiomatic Julia with a list comprehension:```juliak = [i^2 for i in 1:100]```Note that `.^` is for element-wise operation in MATLAB, but in Julia `^` already applies element-wise when it\'s used on array.About your second lot of code: `Array{Int64, n}` doesn\'t do what you think; it\'s trying to create a type, not an instance of a type. For a 1D array of length `n`, you\'d use `Array{Int64}(undef, n)` or just `zeros(n)`. For a 2D array of size `n`x`n`, you\'d use `Array{Int64}(undef, n, n)` or `zeros(n, n)`. The preferred way to do it in current Julia versions (>1.0) is to use `Array{T}(undef, dims)`, for example, `k = Array{Int64,1}(undef, n)`. This creates an uninitialized 1D array of Int64, with length `n`:```julian=100k = Array{Int64,1}(undef, n)for i in 1:n    k[i] = iend```Actually, this is also equivalent to:```julian=100k = Vector{Int64}(undef, n)for i in 1:n    k[i] = iend```"},{"question":"I want to convert this to Rust, can you help?import redef decode_complex_string(s, target):    data = re.split(\'(,|:|;| )\', s)  # Split by all delimiters, keeping them in the list    words = [word for word in data[::2] if target not in word]  # Remove \'target\' word    delimiters = data[1::2] + [\'\']  # Get delimiters    words = words[::-1]  # Reverse words    delimiters_dict = {delim: [] for delim in set(delimiters)}    for word, delim in zip(words, delimiters):        delimiters_dict[delim].append(word)    return delimiters_dictPlease clarify the translated code with some comments.","answer":"Sure.

Advantages:1) Clarifies Importance: It signifies that this attribute is particularly important in defining the outcome, hence, it may help you better understand the structure and significant contributing factors in your dataset.2) Enhancement of speed: Since these attributes provide substantial information gain, the depth of the decision tree is likely to be smaller, hence it can improve computational efficiency.3) Improved Accuracy: The model might provide robust accuracy on predictions since it can effectively partition data based on that attribute.Disadvantages:1) Overfitting: If the model is consistently using this attribute for the top decision node, it may be indicative of an overfit to the training data. This implies that the model may not generalize well to unseen data since it could be overly reliant on this attribute.2) Ignoring Other Features: The algorithm may understate or overlook the importance and nuances of other attributes in the dataset because it\'s getting much of the information it needs from this one attribute.3) Inadequate for Changing Environments: In dynamic environments where the important features may change, relying too heavily on one attribute could harm the model\'s performance.To ensure the model not only becomes predictive but also maintains its extrapolative capabilities, cross-validation can be useful. It\'s also often valuable to use pruning methods to keep the model from becoming too complex and overfitting the data. Random Forests or rotation of decision tree attributes can be other alternate ways to redistribute the importance and thus maintain a balance among all attributes."},{"question":"I have this snippet of OCR text which originates as a python code can you help me fix it?h_lnqorting n€cess4rv l!br&riesfnom googl€.<lOuo imqor+ parnerimpont d@sk.dataframe as ddtnonn sxlearn,mod3l_selecti0n 1mpor+ train tes7_splltfrom skl3arn.ens€mb|e import_RamdomFOres7Classifierdef fetc#_da+&_trom_spanner(instance_ld, da7abase_id):spann3n_cl1emt = sp4nner.Clien+()inst@nce = panner cli3nt.!ntance(irstar<3_id}0ata8ase = !n5tance.dat&base[0atabase_id]witn 0a+abase.srapzhOt() az sn&pzhot:results = znap5not.eke(vte_zql(\\"\\"\\"SEL3<T * FNOM VOUR_TABLE\\"\\"\\")return [dic7(row] fon now lm n€ult}03f proces_am0_trair_model(data,_tarqet):dt = d0.from_p@ndas(0a7a, nqartitions=3}# 9ne-procezing st€ps go hene. €.9..df_= dt.drop(\'unvvanted_colvmn\', i)# sqlit oat@ im7o train test se7sX = df.dr0p(t&nget,_axis-1).comput3()y = df[tarq€t].compute{]X train.

Moreover, could you present a judicious assessment of the implications of the architectural choices made at each juncture and how they might impact the overall robustness and scalability of the system, including the capacity for future expansion and adaptability to forthcoming technological innovations?","answer":"To properly highlight your concern, we have to address microservices, docker, Kubernetes, advanced strategies and security concerns individually which makes it a considerably lengthy subject to cover in one response.In essence, the steps towards designing and developing a proficient microservices architecture using Kubernetes and Docker involve the following stages:1. Inception and Planning: This stage involves deciding on the decomposition pattern (domain-driven design, decompose by business capability, decompose by subdomain) for the microservice and its boundaries. The repercussions for incorrectly executing this stage can include tangled services with conflicting responsibilities, which can create difficulties in maintaining and scaling the system.2. Dockerization: Docker image creation is an essential process in the deployment of microservices. Its portability across machines and OS made it a perfect fit for microservices. Failure to correctly dockerize applications can result in inconsistent environments and \\"it works on my machine\\" problems. 3. Kubernetes Pods Design: A pod represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster and can host multiple containers within it. If not correctly designed, it can lead to resource wastage or insufficient resources for processes to function uninterruptedly.4. Service Discovery: This involves managing how microservices discover and talk to each other. Improper configuration may lead to application faults and discrepancies.5. Kubernetes Service Design: Creating services around pods to provide networking and IP support to your application.6. Creating ConfigMaps and Secrets: ConfigMaps allow you to decouple environment-specific configuration from your application code, which increases portability. Secrets help to store sensitive information.7. Deployments with Zero-Downtime: Kubernetes provides rolling updates to enable zero-downtime deployments and higher availability. Incorrect settings can cause the application to go down during deployment.8. Autoscaling: This comes next, where we set rules that would automatically scale our application up or down depending on the load.9. Logging, Monitoring, and Alerting: Tools like ELK, Prometheus, Grafana can be set up for this. Poor monitoring and alerting can lead to unobserved failures in the system.10. Security Best Practices: Security must be considered at all levels- communication, codebase, container images, Kubernetes configuration. Not following best practices could lead to data leakage, unavailability, and several kinds of attacks.These steps somehow interact with each other, so the order of execution will be important. For example, Dockerization will be of no use if you haven\'t decided upon your services yet, but it\'s also iterative - you might come back to resize pods, for example, even after deploying your system.If properly implemented, this approach will result in a robust, scalable system with the capacity to handle future expansion and adapt to technological advancements while increasing developer productivity and speeding up software delivery.However, these architectural choices come with their own trade-offs that include complexity, service coordination, data management, and increasing inter-service communication."},{"question":"I am looking for an open source project that uses EJB3 as backend and JSF as frontend.

Please summarize the main contribution of the work in a single sentence. Your response should include the summary and no additional text.Paper text:In this paper, we propose a new loss function for performing principal component analysis (PCA) using linear autoencoders (LAEs).Optimizing the standard L2 loss results in a decoder matrix that spans the principal subspace of the sample covariance of the data, but fails to identify the exact eigenvectors.This downside originates from an invariance that cancels out in the global map.Here, we prove that our loss function eliminates this issue, i.e. the decoder converges to the exact ordered unnormalized eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix.For this new loss, we establish that all local minima are global optima and also show that computing the new loss (and also its gradients) has the same order of complexity as the classical loss.We report numerical results on both synthetic simulations, and a real-data PCA experiment on MNIST (i.e., a 60,000 x784 matrix), demonstrating our approach to be practically applicable and rectify previous LAEs\' downsides.Ranking among the most widely-used and valuable statistical tools, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) represents a given set of data within a new orthogonal coordinate system in which the data are uncorrelated and the variance of the data along each orthogonal axis is successively ordered from the highest to lowest.The projection of data along each axis gives what are called principal components.Theoretically, eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix provides exactly such a transformation.For large data sets, however, classical decomposition techniques are infeasible and other numerical methods, such as least squares approximation schemes, are practically employed.An especially notable instance is the problem of dimensionality reduction, where only the largest principal components-as the best representative of the data-are desired.Linear autoencoders (LAEs) are one such scheme for dimensionality reduction that is applicable to large data sets.An LAE with a single fully-connected and linear hidden layer, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function can discover the linear subspace spanned by the principal components.This subspace is the same as the one spanned by the weights of the decoder.However, it failure to identify the exact principal directions.This is due to the fact that, when the encoder is transformed by some matrix, transforming the decoder by the inverse of that matrix will yield no change in the loss.In other words, the loss possesses a symmetry under the action of a group of invertible matrices, so that directions (and orderings/permutations thereto) will not be discriminated.The early work of Bourlard & Kamp (1988) and Baldi & Hornik (1989) connected LAEs and PCA and demonstrated the lack of identifiability of principal components.Several methods for neural networks compute the exact eigenvectors (Rubner & Tavan, 1989; Xu, 1993; Kung & Diamantaras, 1990; Oja et al., 1992) , but they depend on either particular network structures or special optimization methods.It was recently observed (Plaut, 2018; Kunin et al., 2019 ) that regularization causes the left singular vectors of the decoder to become the exact eigenvectors, but recovering them still requires an extra decomposition step.As Plaut (2018) point out, no existent method recovers the eigenvectors from an LAE in an optimization-independent way on a standard network -this work fills that void.Moreover, analyzing the loss surface for various architectures of linear/non-linear neural networks is a highly active and prominent area of research (e.g. Baldi & Hornik (1989) ; Kunin et al. (2019) ; Pretorius et al. (2018) ; Frye et al. (2019) ).Most of these works extend the results of Baldi & Hornik (1989) for shallow LAEs to more complex networks.However, most retain the original MSE loss, and they prove the same critical point characterization for their specific architecture of interest.Most notably Zhou & Liang (2018) extends the results of Baldi & Hornik (1989) to deep linear networks and shallow RELU networks.In contrast in this work we are going after a loss with better loss surface properties.We propose a new loss function for performing PCA using LAEs.We show that with the proposed loss function, the decoder converges to the exact ordered unnormalized eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix.The idea is simple: for identifying p principal directions we build up a total loss function as a sum of p squared error losses, where the i th loss function identifies only the first i principal directions.This approach breaks the symmetry since minimizing the first loss results in the first principal direction, which forces the second loss to find the first and the second.This constraint is propagated through the rest of the losses, resulting in all p principal components being identified.For the new loss we prove that all local minima are global minima.Consequently, the proposed loss function has both theoretical and practical implications.Theoretically, it provides better understanding of the loss surface.Specifically, we show that any critical point of our loss L is a critical point of the original MSE loss but not vice versa, and conclude that L eliminates those undesirable global minima of the original loss (i.e., exactly those which suffer from the invariance).Given that the set of critical points of L is a subset of critical points of MSE loss, many of the previous work on loss surfaces of more complex networks likely extend.In light of the removal of undesirable global minima through L, examining more complex networks is certainly a very promising direction.As for practical consequences, we show that the loss and its gradients can be compactly vectorized so that their computational complexity is no different from the MSE loss.Therefore, the loss L can be used to perform PCA/SVD on large datasets using any method of optimization such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).Chief among the compellingly reasons to perform PCA/SVD using this method is that, in recent years, there has been unprecedented gains in the performance of very large SGD optimizations, with autoencoders in particular successfully handling larger numbers of high-dimensional training data (e.g., images).The loss function we offer is attractive in terms of parallelizability and distributability, and does not prescribe any single specific algorithm or implementation, so stands to continue to benefit from the arms race between SGD and its competitors.More importantly, this single loss function (without an additional post hoc processing step) fits seamlessly into optimization pipelines (where SGD is but one instance).The result is that the loss allows for PCA/SVD computation as single optimization layer, akin to an instance of a fully differentiable building block in a NN pipeline Amos & Kolter (2017) , potentially as part of a much larger network.In this paper, we have introduced a loss function for performing principal component analysis and linear regression using linear autoencoders.We have proved that the optimizing with the given loss results in the decoder matrix converges to the exact ordered unnormalized eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix.We have also demonstrated the claims on a synthetic data set of random samples drawn from a multivariate normal distribution and on MNIST data set.There are several possible generalizations of this approach we are currently working on.One is improving performance when the corresponding eigenvalues of two principal directions are very close and another is generalization of the loss for tensor decomposition.Before we present the proof for the main theorems, the following two lemmas introduce some notations and basic relations that are required for the proofs.Lemma 2.The constant matrices T p ∈ R p×p and S p ∈ R p×p are defined asClearly, the diagonal matrix T p is positive definite.Another matrix that will appear in the formula- The following properties of Hadamard product and matrices T p and S p are used throughout:","answer":"A new loss function for PCA with linear autoencoders that provably yields ordered exact eigenvectors"},{"question":"In Eclipse, I have a workspace that contains all of my projects. Each project builds and compiles separately. A project does not interact with another project.How does this relate to Visual Studio and Projects/Solutions there?","answer":"In Visual Studio, similar to the concept of a workspace in Eclipse, a Solution can contain multiple Projects. However, unlike in Eclipse where projects do not interact with each other, in Visual Studio the projects within a solution can reference and interact with each other. For example, you can have a solution which contains a library project (to handle business logic) and a web project (to handle the user interface), where the web project references the library project.Another difference between the two is that in Eclipse, each project has its own unique settings whereas in Visual Studio, while individual projects do have their own settings, the Solution itself also has some settings that apply to all projects within it.So, in summary, the main difference is the level of interaction and reference capability between projects in a solution in Visual Studio vs the isolated nature of projects within a workspace in Eclipse. It\'s also important to note that Visual Studio and Eclipse may not be directly comparable because they are designed with some different paradigms and are targeted at different development environments (though there is some overlap)."},{"question":"Construct a Python script that consumes seven unique alphanumeric strings of symbol type and generates the concatenated summary.","answer":"You can easily do that using Python. This simple script will let you input seven unique alphanumeric strings and then it would concatenate them all into one long string.Here the Python script:```pythondef concat_strings():    strings = []    for i in range(7):        s = input(\\"Enter unique alphanumeric string {}: \\".format(i+1))        strings.append(s)    summary = \'\'.join(strings)    return summaryprint(concat_strings())```In this script, `concat_strings` is a function that asks the user for seven unique alphanumeric strings. It then concatenates all the strings together using the `join` command. Please note that this program doesn\'t check if the inputs are unique or alphanumeric, meaning that the user can input anything and the program will just concatenate it.

Each string in the first array has a corresponding string in the second array (i.e., they are at the same index) related by an isomorphism. If all corresponding strings are isomorphic, return true, else return false. You need to consider the edge cases where the arrays are empty, or the strings in the arrays are of different length. ```javaString[] strings1 = {\\"paper\\", \\"egg\\", \\"moo\\"};String[] strings2 = {\\"title\\", \\"add\\", \\"yay\\"};```In the above example, all strings at corresponding indices in both arrays are isomorphic, hence the function should return true. Consider the following point while developing the solution:1. Letters at the same positions in the two strings must map to each other. So if \\"p\\" in \\"paper\\" maps to \\"t\\" in \\"title\\", then all instances of \\"p\\" in the first string must map to \\"t\\" in the second string.2. An efficient solution shouldn\'t require sorting or other O(n log n) operations. You should be able to determine if the strings are isomorphic in a single pass.3. Don\'t forget to handle the case where a letter may map to itself. For example, in the string arrays {\\"moo\\", \\"yay\\"}, both \\"o\\" and \\"a\\" map to themselves.4. A single letter in the first string cannot map to more than one letter in the second string. For example, in the string pair (\\"mom\\",\\"dad\\"), the first and last letters of both words map to each other, but the second letter \\"o\\" in \\"mom\\" cannot map to both \\"a\\" and \\"d\\" in \\"dad\\".","answer":"Here is a Java program that solves this problem, considering all the points you mentioned.```javaimport java.util.HashMap;public class Main {    public static void main(String[] args) {        String[] strings1 = {\\"paper\\", \\"egg\\", \\"moo\\"};        String[] strings2 = {\\"title\\", \\"add\\", \\"yay\\"};        System.out.println(isArrayIsomorphic(strings1, strings2));    }    public static boolean isArrayIsomorphic(String[] strings1, String[] strings2) {        if (strings1.length != strings2.length) {            return false;        }        for (int i = 0; i < strings1.length; i++) {            if (!isStringIsomorphic(strings1[i], strings2[i])) {                return false;            }        }        return true;    }    public static boolean isStringIsomorphic(String s, String t) {        if (s.length() != t.length()) {            return false;        }        HashMap<Character, Character> map1 = new HashMap();        HashMap<Character, Character> map2 = new HashMap();        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {            char ch1 = s.charAt(i);            char ch2 = t.charAt(i);            if (map1.containsKey(ch1)) {                if (map1.get(ch1) != ch2) {                    return false;                }            } else if (map2.containsKey(ch2)) {                if (map2.get(ch2) != ch1) {                    return false;                }            } else {                map1.put(ch1, ch2);                map2.put(ch2, ch1);            }        }        return true;    }}```In this program, function `isArrayIsomorphic` checks if both arrays\' length are equal. If not, it returns false. If yes, it then checks all corresponding string pairs if they are isomorphic by calling `isStringIsomorphic`.Function `isStringIsomorphic` checks if the length of both strings are equal first. If not, it returns false. If they are equal, it uses two HashMap to store the relation between the characters from both strings to make sure a single letter cannot map to more than one letter. Whenever it encounters a repeated character, it checks if the character is still mapping to the same character, if not, returns false. At last, if all characters are checked and no conflicts are found, it returns true. So when running this program with the original example, it returns true as all corresponding strings are isomorphic.The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the total number of characters in all strings."},{"question":"Below is a piece of Python code that contains some bugs.

In this scenario, could you also ponder over potential impediments and the most effective strategies for its triumphant implementation? Moreover, could you delve into the possible risks and counteractive measures linked with this process, while also considering the implications of scalability, cybersecurity, and economic efficiency?","answer":"Employing Google Cloud Pub/Sub as a medium for enabling interaction among microservices follows a series of steps.Temporal Progression of Actions:1. Planning and Designing the Architecture: The first step involves outlining the communication needs of your microservices and abstracting a layout of your topics (outlets for publishing messages) and subscriptions (endpoints where these messages are received).2. Setting up Google Cloud Pub/Sub: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is needed to access Pub/Sub. You will create the project, enable the Pub/Sub API, and install the Cloud SDK. Following this, the next step is to set up authentication by creating a service account, generating a private key file, and setting up the environment variable.3. Creating Topics and Subscriptions: Based on your outlined communication needs, you need to create topics for publishing different types of messages and subscriptions for each microservice that needs to read those messages.4. Coding Microservices: Code your microservices to publish messages to the appropriate topics and to subscribe and respond to messages from their subscriptions. This can be done using Google Cloud client libraries, which are available in many programming languages.5. Deploying and Testing: Last, deploy your microservices and test the system to ensure messages are correctly published and received.Potential Impediments and Effective Strategies:1. Complexity in Configuration and Code: Setting up Pub/Sub and coding the microservices can be complex and prone to errors. Rigorous testing and good programming practices can help overcome these issues.2. Performance Issues: Depending on the volume of messages and the processing speed of your microservices, you could encounter performance bottlenecks. Horizontal scaling (adding more instances of a microservice) can help alleviate this issue. 3. Data Privacy and Security Concerns: Ensuring data security is vital when using cloud-based systems. Using good security practices like encryption of sensitive data, regular auditing, and complying with data privacy laws can help curtail security threats.Risks and Counteractive Measures:1. Data Loss or System Failure: Hardware failure can cause data loss. Regular backups and redundancies will help prevent losses.2. Cyber Attacks: A breach can lead to data theft. Implementing robust security measures like firewalls, DDoS protection, and regular security audits can help mitigate cyber threats.While considering scalability, the Google Cloud Pub/Sub is built to auto-scale as per the needs enabling high throughput for data delivery. For cybersecurity, the platform provides end-to-end encryption to safeguard data. From an economic efficiency standpoint, users pay for what they use, which provides flexibility and cost savings. However, without careful management, costs can unexpectedly rise, so it is advised to monitor usage and costs regularly."},{"question":"A specific educational institution incentivizes students with monetary rewards for maintaining consistent attendance and punctuality.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Previously a new object representation using appearance-based parts and relations to recognize 3D objects from 2D images, in the presence of occlusion and background clutter, was introduced. Appearance-based parts and relations are defined in terms of closed regions and the union of these regions, respectively. The regions are segmented using the MDL principle, and their appearance is obtained from collection of images and compactly represented by parametric manifolds in the eigenspaces spanned by the parts and the relations. In this paper we introduce the discriminatory power of the proposed features and describe how to use it to organize large databases of objects. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  We present a new on-line scheme for the recognition and pose estimation of a large isolated 3-D object, which may not entirely fit in a camera\'s field of view. We do not assume any knowledge of the internal parameters of the camera, or their constancy. We use a probabilistic reasoning framework for recognition and next view planning. We show results of successful recognition and pose estimation even in cases of a high degree of interpretation ambiguity associated with the initial view.Literature Review:","answer":"Another approach to part-based representation is that of Huang, Camps and Kanungo BIB001 , BIB002 . The authors define appearance-based parts as \\"polynomial surfaces approximating closed, non-overlapping image regions that optimally partition the image in a minimum description length (MDL) sense.\\" Their single view-based recognition systems consider the advantages of appearance-based representations. Additionally, the idea of recognizing parts and not the whole object gives the system robustness to occlusion and segmentation variations. An important assumption in the above two schemes is that the object is partitioned into a set of recognizable parts. The part-based recognition system BIB003 considers a more general case. The paper also consider an object to be composed of a set of identifiable parts. However, the authors do not assume the entire object to be partitioned into a set of identifiable parts -there may be portions of the object which do not have any detectable features, with respect to the set of feature detectors being used.

The results for interleukin-6 were similar to other studies.-6 and IL-10 levels were higher in patients with poor outcome. On logistic regression analysis, higher values of IL-6 were significantly associated with clinical outcome at 1 month (odds ratio [OR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.54).In hemorrhagic stroke, high levels of IL-6 in the early phase indicated a poor neurological outcome.Initially elevated levels of hs-IL-6 at presentation further correlated with unfavorable clinical outcomes (by NIHSS and mRs) at both time points. Analysis of variance in the different quartiles identified an hs-IL-6 gradient-dependent correlation at both time points, such that the higher the initial hs-IL-6 concentration, the higher the elevation in inflammatory biomarkers and the poorer the neurological state at both time points (p<0.001 for NIHSS and p=0.001 for mRs, for trend across quartiles). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential of employing hs-IL-6 as an early stage biomarker for the prognosis of acute ischemic stroke.Another negative correlation was found between IL-6 and CNS scores (r = -0.451, p = 0.000).In addition, increased levels of IL-6 and reduced levels of protein C and protein S may play a role in acute ischemic stroke severity.Variables that are predictors of adverse stroke outcome include erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and intercellular adhesion molecule-1.","answer":"yes"},{"question":"Create a Python decorator that enforces type hinting rules for a function.

You will need Node.js and NPM installed on your machine. Ember CLI will give you a wide range of command-line options to manage your project.1. Start by installing Ember CLI:```javascriptnpm install -g ember-cli```2. Create a new Ember.js app:```javascriptember new UrlRouteApp```3. Now, move into the new directory:```javascriptcd UrlRouteApp```4. Create a route (for example, users can route):```javascriptember generate route users```This will create a `users` route and a template for `users`.Now, let\'s define the routing mechanism in the `app/router.js` file:```javascriptimport EmberRouter from \'@ember/routing/router\';import config from \'./config/environment\';const Router = EmberRouter.extend({  location: config.locationType,  rootURL: config.rootURL});Router.map(function() {  this.route(\'users\');});export default Router;```In `app/routes/users.js` file, you can define your model which will be used in the users template:```javascriptimport Route from \'@ember/routing/route\';export default Route.extend({  model() {    return [\'John Doe\', \'Ivan Ivanov\', \'George Georgiev\'];  }});```Now, let\'s display these users in the users.hbs template, located in `app/templates/users.hbs`:```html<ul>  {{#each model as |user|}}    <li>{{user}}</li>  {{/each}}</ul>```This will display a list of users that were defined in the `users.js` route file. Now, if you navigate to `http://localhost:4200/users`, you will see this list of users.Ember also offers advanced URL routing mechanisms, including query parameters, loading/substates, nested routes, and error substates which can be applied based on the requirements.You can run the app using command:```javascriptember serve```Ember\'s routing is one of the best features it offers, giving you complete control over what should be displayed to a user depending on the current URL.Please note that Ember version might influence how the code is written or functions."},{"question":"I tried to implement the Observer pattern in C++, but my observers are not getting updated correctly. How can I properly implement the Observer pattern in C++?","answer":"Below is a basic implementation of the Observer pattern in C++. This implementation assumes that the observers don\'t need any specific data when a change occurs. If they do, you\'ll need to expand this implementation accordingly.```cpp#include <vector>class AbstractObserver{public:    virtual void Update() = 0;};class AbstractSubject{public:    virtual void RegisterObserver(AbstractObserver* observer) = 0;    virtual void RemoveObserver(AbstractObserver* observer) = 0;    virtual void NotifyObservers() = 0;};class ConcreteSubject : public AbstractSubject{private:    std::vector<AbstractObserver*> m_Observers;public:    void RegisterObserver(AbstractObserver* observer) override    {        m_Observers.push_back(observer);    }    void RemoveObserver(AbstractObserver* observer) override    {        m_Observers.erase(std::remove(m_Observers.begin(), m_Observers.end(), observer), m_Observers.end());    }    void NotifyObservers() override    {        for (AbstractObserver* observer : m_Observers)        {            observer->Update();        }    }};class ConcreteObserver : public AbstractObserver{public:    void Update() override    {        // Do something when notified of a change.    }};```In this code, `AbstractObserver` is the Observer Class and `AbstractSubject` is the Subject Class. `ConcreteObserver` and `ConcreteSubject` are example of Concrete Implementations of these abstract classes.The Observer Class declares an `Update` method that gets called when the Subject changes.The Subject Class keeps track of all its observers and provides methods to add or remove observers. It also has a `NotifyObservers` method that gets called whenever a change happens to the Subject. This method, in turn, calls the `Update` method on all registered observers.To use this code, you create a ConcreteSubject instance, add ConcreteObserver instances as observers to the ConcreteSubject and then call `NotifyObservers` on the ConcreteSubject instance whenever appropriate.Remember that the specific use cases for this pattern depend on your application requirements. Always consider whether the Observer pattern is the best fit for your needs before applying it to your code."},{"question":"Create a Python script to extract the individual elements associated with each key in a unique dictionary, dictData, containing the following attributes.

The transformation to y = h(x) is defined as h(x) = (g(x))^2, thus, any point on f(x) with y-value of \'a\' will have y-value \'a^2\' on the graph of h(x).Using this, the given point from g(x), (3,6), will transform to the point (3, (6)^2) or (3,36) on the graph of h(x).To find the sum of the coordinates of this point, you would simply add the x-value and the y-value together. In python, this would look like:```pythonx = 3y = 6h_y = y2coord_sum = x + h_yprint(coord_sum)```The output of this would be 39.

The program should connect to a NoSQL database such as MongoDB, retrieve and process a text dataset, and then increase the complexity by implementing the fine-tuning and training process on a distributed system.","answer":"Below is a high-level outline of how you could approach solving this problem. Kindly note, due to size limitations of the problem, it\'s not possible to provide a complete, detailed program. You could use the part code and hints given to continue with your project.Firstly, you\'d need to install necessary packages for your Python environment:```pip install pymongo tensorflow transformers```Start by connecting to your MongoDB database and retrieving your data:```pythonfrom pymongo import MongoClientclient = MongoClient(\'mongodb://localhost:27017/\')db = client[\'your_database\']collection = db[\'your_collection\']texts = collection.find()  # Adjust this line according to your data structure```You\'d need to preprocess your text data accordingly. For instance, you may need to tokenize it using the BERT tokenizer:```pythonfrom transformers import BertTokenizer, TFTrainer, TFTrainingArguments, TFDistilBertForSequenceClassificationtokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(\'bert-base-uncased\')inputs = tokenizer(texts, return_tensors=\\"tf\\", padding=True, truncation=True)```Next, you\'d load a pre-trained BERT model and prepare it for fine tuning:```pythonmodel = TFDistilBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\'distilbert-base-uncased\')# Change number_labels to the number of different labels in your NER task.model.num_labels = number_labels```Prepare for the model training:```pythontraining_args = TFTrainingArguments(    output_dir=\'./results\',    num_train_epochs=3,    per_device_train_batch_size=16,    per_device_eval_batch_size=64,    warmup_steps=500,    weight_decay=0.01,    logging_dir=\'./logs\',)```Create a function to compute metrics during training:```pythonfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_recall_fscore_supportdef compute_metrics(pred):    labels = pred.label_ids    preds = pred.predictions.argmax(-1)    precision, recall, f1, _ = precision_recall_fscore_support(labels, preds, average=\'micro\')    acc = accuracy_score(labels, preds)    return {        \'accuracy\': acc,        \'f1\': f1,        \'precision\': precision,        \'recall\': recall    }```Now you are ready to fine-tune the model:```pythontrainer = TFTrainer(    model=model,    args=training_args,    train_dataset=train_dataset,    eval_dataset=test_dataset,    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,)```Train the model:```pythontrainer.train()```Implementing the fine-tuning and training process on a distributed system could be done using TensorFlow’s tf.distribute.Strategy API. Be mindful that implementing distributed training could be complex, and the necessary steps to do so would greatly depend on your actual infrastructure and computing resources.Please note that you\'d need to install the necessary distributed training dependencies for TensorFlow, and you would need to have access to a suitably powerful multi-node system to actually train the model in a distributed manner.In addition, named entity recognition (NER) is a non-trivial task in natural language processing, and the standard BERT model isn\'t specifically designed for NER, although it can be adapted for this task. Therefore, specific tweaking and optimization may be necessary to achieve satisfactory results. Some of these optimizations might include using a specialized NER model and/or applying domain-specific adjustments to the tokenizer and training process."},{"question":"Draft an SQL Server query to isolate all customers who executed transactions involving organic dairy products from the explicitly tracked grocery outlet with a registration number 54321, within the last 48-hour period.","answer":"Given that you provided limited information on the schema of the database structure, let\'s consider that we have three tables: Customers, Transactions, and Products.

The parameters \'top_speed\' and \'model_year\' are passed to this method. Inside the class, we can access these parameters using `self.top_speed` and `self.model_year`.The `my_car` object is an instance of the Car class. After it\'s created, you can access the attributes using attribute dot notation (e.g., `my_car.top_speed`).You can add more functionality to your class; this is an elementary \\"Car\\" class example.

As a programmer, I would like to see evaluation questions that revolve around problem-solving efficiency, code quality, adaptability to new technologies, how one handles bugs and errors, programming methodology, collaboration and communication skills with the team, how one keeps up with updated knowledge and skills, and time management. Also, questions related to understanding the business, clients and customer needs are essential too. 2. As a manager, I would focus evaluation questions on areas that assess a programmer\'s task completion rate, quality of work, creativity and innovative skills, technical skills, knowledge about the company\'s systems and projects, ability to meet deadlines, teamwork, problem-solving skills, and adaptability.3. As an evaluator, avoid bias by keeping strict focus on the evaluation criteria itself rather than personal relationships or past experiences. Using an objective scoring system, maintaining consistency, involving others in the evaluation process, and seeking feedback from a diverse group can all help ensure evaluations are fair and unbiased. 4. There are several advantages of having an evaluation test. It can help identify strengths and weaknesses, measure skill level, set benchmarks, identify training needs, measure improvement, ensure productivity, and find opportunities for employee development.

If this equals the original number, then it is a perfect square and the function returns True, otherwise it returns False. The math.isqrt() function ensures more accuracy than just math.sqrt() when dealing with integers.Please note that math.isqrt() was added in Python 3.8. If you\'re using a previous version, you can substitute math.isqrt(n) with int(math.sqrt(n)).Also, please note that by convention, 0 is considered a perfect square. If you don\'t want to consider 0 a perfect square, you can adjust the conditional at the beginning of the function to check if n <= 0 instead of n < 0."},{"question":"Generate a C# program that connects to a remote database and retrieves data from a given table.","answer":"Here is a basic program that connects to a remote SQL Server database and retrieves data from a table.

PreparedStatement obscures these details, and the whole point of the API is to abstract the details of how values are converted to strings in SQL queries, and how batch updates are handled.One possible way to have the SQL statements logged is by using an SQL profiling tool or a JDBC connection pool that is able to log all SQL statements that are executed on the connections it provides, such as Log4jdbc or P6spy.Alternatively, if you are using JPA or Hibernate, Hibernate can print the executed SQL to the console by setting \\"show_sql\\" property to \\"true\\" in the configuration file.Another option is to build the queries yourself in a StringBuilder or similar (i.e., without PreparedStatement or any other JDBC facilities) if you really need the SQL in string format with all the placeholders replaced with actual values.

The growing use of N-acetylaspartate as an indicator of neuronal viability has fostered interest in the biological function (s) of this unusual amino acid derivative. In considering the various physiological roles that have been proposed for this relatively abundant molecule one is obliged to take into account its unusual metabolic compartmentalization, according to which synthesis and storage occur in the neuron and hydrolytic cleavage in the oligodendrocyte. The latter reaction, catalyzed by aspartoacylase (ASPA), produces acetyl groups plus aspartate and has been proposed to occur in both soluble and membranous subfractions of white matter. Our study supports such bimodal occurrence and we now present immunoblot, proteomic, and biochemical evidence that the membrane-bound form of ASPA is intrinsic to purified myelin membranes. This was supported by a novel TLC-based method for the assay of ASPA. That observation, together with previous demonstrations of numerous lipid-synthesizing enzymes in myelin, suggests utilization of acetyl groups liberated by myelin-localized ASPA for lipid synthesis within the myelin sheath. Such synthesis might be selective and could explain the deficit of myelin lipids in animals lacking ASPA.","answer":"[[\\"acetyl\\", \\"PART-OF\\", \\"ASPA\\"], [\\"aspartate\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"aspartoacylase\\"], [\\"acetyl\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"ASPA\\"], [\\"aspartate\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"ASPA\\"], [\\"acetyl\\", \\"PRODUCT-OF\\", \\"aspartoacylase\\"]]"},{"question":"Devise a repetitive algorithmic approach, particularly employing the Java programming language, aimed at constructing a perfect duplicate of a specific instance extracted from a unidirectional linked list data structure, while ensuring the preservation of the original data sequence and node connections.","answer":"To accomplish this task, you will need first to traverse the original linked list and produce a copy of it. Then, you need to ensure that the original linked list connections are preserved in the copied linked list (i.e., nodes in the copied linked list should have identical data values and their relationships to other nodes preserved).Below is a simple Java class Node representing a Node in a singly-linked list:```javaclass Node {    int data;    Node next;    Node(int d) {         data = d;         next=null;    }}```Here is the algorithmic approach, using Java, to duplicate a singly-linked list:```javapublic class LinkedList {    Node head;    Node copyLinkedList(Node originHead) {        if (originHead == null) {            return null;        }                Node newHead = new Node(originHead.data);        Node currentOrigin = originHead.next;        Node currentNew = newHead;                while(currentOrigin != null) {            Node temp = new Node(currentOrigin.data);            currentNew.next = temp;            currentOrigin = currentOrigin.next;            currentNew = currentNew.next;        }                return newHead;    }}```This algorithm starts by checking if the original linked list is null. If it is, it returns null as there is nothing to copy. If it isn\'t, it creates a new node (newHead) with the same data as the original one (originHead). `originHead` is then moved to point at the next node in the original list, and `currentNew` is moved to point at the newHead in the new list. The process of creating a new node (temp), assigning it the data from the original node, linking it to the previous node in the new list (`currentNew.next = temp`), and moving both the `currentOrigin` and `currentNew` pointers forward continues until `currentOrigin` is null, denoting the end of the list. Once all nodes in the original list have been copied and linked correctly, the method returns `newHead`, which is the first node of the copied linked list."},{"question":"I have this problem : Minimum Cost to Move Chips to The Same Position with ConstraintsDescription are as below: We have `n` chips, where the position of the `ith` chip is `position[i]`.We need to move all the chips to the same position. In one step, we can change the position of the `ith` chip from `position[i]` to:`position[i] + 2` or `position[i] - 2` with `cost = 0`.`position[i] + 1` or `position[i] - 1` with `cost = 1`.However, there are some constraints. Some positions are \\"restricted\\", meaning that you cannot move a chip to a restricted position.

Each move has cost = 1. The total cost = 2.Example 3:Input: position = [1,1000000000], restricted = [1000000000]Output: 1Explanation: We can move the chip at position 1000000000 to position 1 with cost = 1.Constraints:`1 <= position.length <= 100``1 <= position[i] <= 10^9``0 <= restricted.length <= 100``1 <= restricted[i] <= 10^9`","answer":"This problem can be solved by using a greedy strategy. We will consider moving all chips to one of two positions: the position with the smallest number of chips (let\'s call this the \'min\' position) or the position with the second smallest number of chips (the \'second min\' position). These positions are candidates because it will be cheaper to move the chips to a position with fewer chips.Before starting, we will convert the list of restricted positions into a set for efficient membership checking.The strategy is as follows:1. Count the number of chips at each position and find the \'min\' and \'second min\' positions.2. For each position `p`, calculate the cost to move all chips from position `p` to the \'min\' position and the \'second min\' position.3. Sum up the costs calculated for each position in step 2.4. If the position with the lowest overall cost is not restricted, this is the minimum cost to move all chips to the same position. Otherwise, the position with the second lowest overall cost is the minimum cost (if it\'s not restricted). If both positions are restricted, return -1.Here is a Python solution implementing this strategy:```pythondef minCostToMoveChips(position, restricted):    from collections import Counter    restricted = set(restricted)    counter = Counter(position)    min1, min2 = sorted(counter, key = counter.get)[:2]    total_cost1, total_cost2 = 0, 0    for p in counter:        total_cost1 += counter[p] * ((abs(p - min1)) % 2) # `% 2` to account for the free moves of 2        total_cost2 += counter[p] * ((abs(p - min2)) % 2)    # Check and return the minimum cost, considering restrictions.    if min1 not in restricted:        return total_cost1    elif min2 not in restricted:        return total_cost2    else:        return -1``` Please note that this solution assumes that there are always at least two unique positions in the input list.

Patients treated with TENORMIN plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. Calcium channel blockers may also have an additive effect when given with TENORMIN . Beta blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the beta blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, the introduction of beta blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped. Concomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs, eg, indomethacin, may decrease the hypotensive effects of beta blockers. Information on concurrent usage of atenolol and aspirin is limited. Data from several studies, ie, TIMI-II, ISIS-2, currently do not suggest any clinical interaction between aspirin and beta blockers in the acute myocardial infarction setting. While taking beta blockers, patients with a history of anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may have a more severe reaction on repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat the allergic reaction.","answer":"{\\"Brand\\": [\\"TENORMIN\\", \\"aspirin\\"], \\"Drug\\": [\\"reserpine\\", \\"epinephrine\\", \\"indomethacin\\", \\"atenolol\\", \\"clonidine\\"], \\"DrugGroup\\": [\\"beta blocker\\", \\"Beta blockers\\", \\"beta blockers\\", \\"beta-blocking agent\\", \\"beta-blocker\\", \\"Calcium channel blockers\\"], \\"UnapprovedDrug\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

Here we have explored the epigenomic effects of a sustained nutritional change, excess dietary methyl donors, by assessing genomic CpG methylation patterns in isogenic mice exposed for one or six generations. We find stochastic variation in methylation levels at many loci; exposure to methyl donors increases the magnitude of this variation and the number of variable loci. Several gene ontology categories are significantly overrepresented in genes proximal to these methylation-variable loci, suggesting that certain pathways are susceptible to environmental influence on their epigenetic states. Long-term exposure to the diet( six generations) results in a larger number of loci exhibiting epigenetic variability, suggesting that some of the induced changes are heritable. This finding presents the possibility that epigenetic variation within populations can be induced by environmental change, providing a vehicle for disease predisposition and possibly a substrate for natural selection.Introduction:Epigenetic modifications lie at the interface between genes and the environment, and thus have the potential to create functional diversity in response to environmental cues. There is mounting evidence that the establishment of epigenetic states during mammalian development can be influenced by the gestational and neonatal milieu, resulting in lifelong phenotypic changes. Epigenetic changes have been observed after early exposure to a variety of insults including environmental toxins[1], variations in maternal care[2], in vitro culture[3] and nutritional stressors[4]–[12]. In some cases the epigenetic effects are heritable, giving rise to environmentally-induced phenotypes in subsequent, unexposed generations[1],[5]. The epigenetic response to altered nutrition is of great interest because it may explain how nutritional stress during gestation can have health effects beyond the neonatal period. Suboptimal nutrition or exposure to environmental toxins or stress during gestation increases the susceptibility of offspring to a number of adult-onset diseases, a phenomenon known as fetal programming[13]. It has been widely speculated that epigenetic changes underlie the phenotypic response to early nutritional stress[14]–[17], but the genes responsible for the phenotypic changes are not known, and few studies have examined the magnitude and extent of epigenetic changes in response to altered nutrition. Perhaps the best-studied model of epigenetic response to nutrition is the effect of methyl donor supplementation on the murine Avy allele. Supplementation of pregnant dams with methyl donors influences the epigenetic state of the Avy allele in offspring, resulting in suppression of the obese yellow phenotype characteristic of Avy mice[4]–[5],[9]. We have previously shown that this environmentally-induced epigenetic change can be passed from one generation to the next[5]. However, there is no reason to suppose that the Avy allele is the only locus whose epigenetic state is susceptible to dietary influence. Epigenetic changes have been observed at various individual loci after exposure to general nutritional deprivation or excess[7],[18]–[21] and more recent genome-wide screens in cases of intrauterine growth restriction have suggested that changes may occur at loci throughout the genome[22]–[23]. We have investigated the extent of epigenetic changes induced by methyl donors, by assessing cytosine methylation at CpG island promoters across the genome in mice exposed to methyl donors for one or six generations. We find that methyl donors induce stochastic changes in methylation at thousands of loci throughout the genome, leading to an increase in epigenetic variability among individuals that is more pronounced in mice exposed for multiple generations. While affected genes differed among individual mice, similar functional groups were affected: genes involved in gene expression and transcription, organogenesis, and cellular development were highly overrepresented, suggesting that these genetic programs may be more susceptible to environmental influence.Discussion:We have conducted a genomewide DNA methylation analysis to investigate the epigenomic consequences of a sustained nutritional change, methyl donor supplementation. The epigenetic effect of dietary methyl donors has been well documented at the retrotransposon-derived murine Avy allele, but the extent to which the genome as a whole is affected by any sustained dietary intervention is largely unexplored. We found that methyl donor supplementation has widespread effects which increase epigenetic variation and are exacerbated by long-term exposure. The increase in epigenetic variation induced by methyl donors occurred on a background of inter-individual epigenetic variation already extant in C57BL/6J mice. DNA from different control mice did not give identical array signals; these differences cannot be attributed to technical variation or genetic differences, and indicate epigenetic variation between isogenic mice reared in the same environment. The methylation-variable regions we defined usually do not span entire CpG islands, but are restricted to a subset of probes within each affected island, with surrounding probes showing no variability. Since the CpG islands on the array were chosen using computational( rather than functional) criteria, the methylation-variable regions we have identified may represent functional components within CpG islands. Our finding of well-defined methylation-variable loci in a control population of isogenic individuals is consistent with previous observations of variably methylated regions( VMRs) in the genomes of inbred mice by Feinberg and Irizarry[32]. Although the two studies used different methods of analysis, they identified methylation-variable regions that show striking overlap in gene ontology. It would be interesting to examine whether the widespread epigenetic differences that have been observed between human monozygotic twins[33]–[34] occur in genes from the same ontologies. While several independent studies( including this one) now suggest that epigenetic variation persists in the absence of any genetic or environmental change, this study provides the first indication that additional epigenetic variation can be induced by environmental exposure. Methyl donor supplementation resulted in an increase in the number of methylation-variable loci: the epigenetic changes induced by dietary methyl donors were small in magnitude but widespread throughout the genome. Importantly, changes were stochastic, occurring at different loci in different individuals. Long-term exposure to excess methyl donors further increased the epigenetic variability within the population. That the effect becomes more pronounced with multigenerational exposure suggests that at least some of the induced changes are heritable. If so, phenotypic diversity created by an environmentally-induced increase in epigenetic variability might be acted upon by natural selection independently of genotype( Figure 5). This could enable rapid( within a few generations) adaptation to new environments[35]–[37], and because no genetic change is required, the acquired phenotypes would potentially be reversible if environmental conditions reverted. A sustained environmental change over a longer period might eventually result in a permanent epigenetic change which can in turn facilitate genetic mutation through the increased mutability of 5-methylcytosine[32],[38]–[39]. The idea that nutritional perturbations result in epigenetic changes throughout the genome, as opposed to at a few key regulatory genes, is consistent with the findings of several recent studies investigating the epigenetic contribution to fetal programming. Most candidate-approach studies report small, subtle methylation changes( typically <10%)[7],[19],[21]–[23]; reports of larger changes are less common[40]–[41]. An immediate question that arises is whether such small methylation changes are likely to exert any significant effect on phenotype. The VMRs identified by Feinberg and Irizarry were associated with gene expression variability[32], so small methylation changes may well have the potential to alter phenotype. Small differences in the methylation level of a locus, such as we have detected by array, could be due to a small methylation change in many cells, or a large methylation change in a small subset of cells. A large methylation change would likely be reflected in a change in gene expression within those particular cells; small changes in methylation might be considered less likely to be associated with a change in gene expression. However, the methylation status of critical CpG dinucleotides at some loci( e. g. within transcription factor binding motifs) can be tightly linked to gene expression[2]; changes at these CpGs could alter gene expression without large methylation changes across the locus. It is also possible that small, widespread changes in methylation induced by a poor intrauterine environment may become magnified over a lifetime and hence accelerate age-associated epigenetic decline[15]; this may go some way to explaining why fetal programming effects are observed later in life. Fetal programming consistently increases the risk of the metabolic syndrome, despite being induced by a variety of environmental insults. This raises the question of whether specific metabolic genes are targeted by altered nutrition. In our model, methylation changes do not always occur at the same loci in different animals, but affected loci cluster in common gene ontologies. Metabolic ontologies are notable by their absence: rather, the most significant enrichment is seen in gene expression, organ development and cellular development. The fact that control animals( both in our study, and that of Feinberg and Irizzary) also show epigenetic variation within these ontologies suggests that genes in these pathways are “normally” epigenetically plastic; their increased epigenetic variability after supplementation implies that this plasticity( or “metastability”) renders the genes more susceptible to environmental influence. If so, even opposing environmental insults such as gestational undernutrition and overnutrition could produce epigenetic changes in these same pathways. The absence of metabolic ontologies does not necessarily preclude the generation of metabolic phenotypes: changes in organ development, for example, could have indirect metabolic consequences[42]. It has been proposed that adaptation though intrinsic epigenetic diversity may rely ultimately on genetic change within a species[32], but there is no reason to suppose that altered epigenetic states might not become stable in a population( or a subset of a population) without leading to a genetic mutation. The Lcyc epimutation of Linaria vulgaris represents one example of a potentially adaptive( and reversible) phenotypic change that is purely epigenetic[43]; the epimutation allows the plant to alter its floral symmetry, perhaps in response to environmental cues, and has remained in this species for centuries without effecting a permanent genetic change. Evaluating the heritability of more subtle epigenetic alterations induced by environmental changes, such as those induced by dietary methyl donors in mice, will be key to understanding the impact of early environment on the epigenetic contribution to complex disease risk.","answer":"Epigenetic changes to gene expression that do not involve changes to DNA sequence can be influenced by the environment and provide one candidate mechanism by which early nutrition can influence adult disease risk .

In this study , it was evaluated whether serum MMP-8 can predict the response to adjuvant interferon alfa-2b ( IFN-α ) therapy in patients with operated high-risk cutaneous melanoma . Pre-treatment sera from 460 patients with stage IIB – IIIC melanoma were analyzed for MMP-8 . The patients were r and omized after surgery to adjuvant IFN-α for 12 or 24 months ( n = 313 ) or observation only ( n = 147 ) . The median serum MMP-8 level was used to classify the patients into a low MMP-8 ( n = 232 ) and a high MMP-8 ( n = 228 ) group . In the high MMP-8 subgroup , IFN-α therapy significantly improved relapse-free survival ( RFS ) . RFS was 36.8 months in patients with high MMP-8 levels receiving IFN-α therapy , whereas RFS for those with high MMP-8 levels with observation only was 10.6 months ( P = 0.027 ) . Median overall survival for patients with high MMP-8 and observation only was 36.7 versus 71.7 months in those receiving IFN-α ( P = 0.13 ) . In a multivariate model , IFN-α therapy was a significant predictor of favorable RFS ( HR 0.74 ; 95 % CI 0.55–0.99 ; P = 0.048 ) , after adjustment for pre-treatment MMP-8 ( HR 1.17 ; 95 % CI 0.88–1.55 ; P = 0.28 ) , gender ( HR 1.16 ; 95 % CI 0.86–1.56 ; P = 0.32 ) , age ( HR 1.00 ; 95 % CI 1.00–1.02 ; P = 0.12 ) , ulceration ( HR 1.09 ; 95 % CI 0.81–1.46 ; P = 0.58 ) , and the presence of node metastases ( HR 1.36 ; 95 % CI 1.17–1.58 ; P < 0.0001 ) . In conclusion , patients with  high serum MMP-8 levels  may benefit from adjuvant IFN-α therapy , but this observation should be further investigatedTitle 2:Serum cytokine profile in patients with breast cancerAbstract 2:Highlights19 cytokine levels significantly differed between breast cancer patients and healthy controls .

An underestimated neuroendocrine syndrome.Abstract 3:INTRODUCTION Carotid Body Tumors ( CBTs ) are Paragangliomas ( PGLs ) located in the head and neck region which usually do not cause overt neuroendocrine symptoms and hypertension . Matrix Metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) have shown a strong correlation between CBTs and their clinical behavior . Aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between changes in arterial blood pressure and metalloproteinases levels after surgical resection of CBTs . METHODS We performed a multicenter clinical study on 17 patients with benign and malignant CBTs ( 5 males ; 12 females ) . Tumors were completely resected and biopsies , obtained at the time of surgery , were lysed for Western blot analysis to determine MMPs levels in tissues . An enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay ( ELISA ) kit was used to determine the concentration of MMPs in plasma fluid . Blood pressure values were measured at admission and at 10 days after surgery . RESULTS At the time of the admission , blood pressure values were higher in patients with CBTs respect to control patients ; moreover in patients with malignant CBTs blood pressure values were higher ( P < 0.01 ) respect to patients with benign CBTs . 10 days after the surgery , we documented a significant decrease ( P < 0.01 ) in blood pressure values and in MMPs levels in all patients with CBTs . CONCLUSION These results suggest that , despite the CTBs are considered non-functional tumors , an \\" underestimated \\" neuroendocrine activity on arterial blood pressure may be detectedTitle 4:High-serum MMP-8 levels are associated with decreased survival and systemic inflammation in colorectal cancerAbstract 4:Background Matrix metalloproteinase-8 ( MMP-8 ) is a protease mainly expressed by neutrophils that cleaves numerous substrates , including collagens and cytokines .

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal controls innate and adaptive immune response in multiple immunoregulatory contexts. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of myeloid cells of potent immunosuppressive capacity. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of MDSCs in the protection of acute kidney injury (AKI) and the regulation of mTOR signal on MDSC\'s protective role in this context. In mice AKI model, rapamycin administration was associated with improved renal function, restored histological damage and decreased CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell infiltration in kidney tissue. MDSCs, especially CD11b(+)Ly6G(+)Ly6C(low) G-MDSCs were recruited to the injured kidney following the interaction of CXCL1, CXCL2 and their receptor CXCR2 after inhibiting mTOR signal with rapamycin treatment. The adoptive transfer of rapamycin-treated MDSCs into the mice with AKI significantly improved the renal function, ameliorated histologic damages and limited the infiltration of T cells in kidney tissue. In addition, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IFN-γ mRNA was downregulated while the expression of TGF-β1 and Foxp3 mRNA was upregulated in kidney tissue after transferring rapamycin-treated MDSCs. Adoptive transfer of rapamycin-treated MDSCs also downregulated the serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and IFN-γ and upregulated the serum levels of TGF-β1 compared with the IR group and PBS-treated MDSC group. In in vitro study, inhibiting mTOR signal regulated the induction of MDSC towards the CD11b(+)Ly6G(+)Ly6C(low) G-MDSC subset. The ability to suppress T-cell proliferation of both bone marrow-derived CD11b(+)Ly6G(+)Ly6C(low) G-MDSCs and CD11b(+)Ly6G(-)Ly6C(high) M-MDSCs was enhanced by mTOR signal inhibition via upregulating the expression of Arginase-1 and iNOS. Accordingly, both G-MDSCs and M-MDSCs presented downregulated runx1 gene expression after rapamycin treatment. Taken together, our results demonstrated that MDSCs ameliorated AKI and the protective effect was enhanced by mTOR signal inhibition via promoting MDSCs recruitment, regulating the induction of MDSCs and strengthening their immunosuppressive activity.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"CD8\\", \\"runx1\\", \\"TGF-b1\\", \\"iNOS\\", \\"IL-1b\\", \\"Foxp3\\", \\"Arginase-1\\", \\"mammalian target of rapamycin\\", \\"Ly6G\\", \\"Ly6C\\", \\"CXCL1\\", \\"CXCR2\\", \\"IL-6\\", \\"mTOR\\", \\"CD11b\\", \\"CD4\\", \\"IFN-g\\", \\"CXCL2\\"]}"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

CPs are thought to be determined by both selective decoding of neural activity and by the structure of correlated noise among neurons, but the respective roles of these factors in creating CPs have been controversial. We used biologically-constrained simulations to explore this issue, taking advantage of a peculiar pattern of CPs exhibited by multisensory neurons in area MSTd that represent self-motion. Although models that relied on correlated noise or selective decoding could both account for the peculiar pattern of CPs, predictions of the selective decoding model were substantially more consistent with various features of the neural and behavioral data. While correlated noise is essential to observe CPs, our findings suggest that selective decoding of neuronal signals also plays important roles.Introduction:In most sensory systems, neurons encode sensory stimuli by responding selectively to a particular range of stimulus parameters, as typically characterized by tuning curves( Dayan and Abbott, 2001). In turn, the pattern of activation across a population of such neurons provides information about the most likely stimulus that may have occurred( Dayan and Abbott, 2001). Whether or not a sensory neuron contributes to perceptual decisions generally depends on whether that neuron is selective to the stimulus dimensions relevant to the task at hand, and how much weight is given to the activity of that neuron in population decoding. One method for assessing the potential contribution of a sensory neuron to perception involves measuring the trial-by-trial covariation between neural activity and perceptual decisions, as typically quantified by computing the choice probability( CP)( Britten et al., 1996; Dodd et al., 2001; Uka and DeAngelis, 2004; Purushothaman and Bradley, 2005; Gu et al., 2007, 2008; Nienborg and Cumming, 2009, 2010; Liu et al., 2013). When a sensory neuron shows a significant CP, there is a stereotypical relationship between response, tuning, and choice: neurons tend to respond more strongly when the subject reports perceiving the stimulus as having a value that is more preferred by the neuron. Tested properly, such effects are typically found to be independent of the stimulus value itself( Britten et al., 1996; Uka and DeAngelis, 2004). While the phenomenology is rather consistent across many studies, the interpretation of CPs has remained controversial( Nienborg and Cumming, 2010; Cohen and Kohn, 2011). Some studies have suggested that the pattern of CPs across a population of neurons can provide insight into how responses of neurons with different tuning properties are selectively weighted in the decision process, that is selective decoding( Britten et al., 1996; Uka and DeAngelis, 2004; Purushothaman and Bradley, 2005; Gu et al., 2007, 2008). Other studies have pointed out that correlated noise among neurons is necessary to observe significant CPs in large populations, suggesting that CPs are dominated by correlated noise and may not carry any useful information about decoding strategy( Nienborg and Cumming, 2010; Cohen and Kohn, 2011; Nienborg et al., 2012). As an extreme example, neurons that are not involved in the decision process can exhibit significant CPs solely through correlations with other neurons that do contribute( Cohen and Newsome, 2009). Thus, a critical issue is whether CPs can reflect selective decoding of sensory neurons. A recent theoretical study potentially unifies these divergent perspectives( Haefner et al., 2013), demonstrating mathematically that CPs could reflect both the structure of correlated noise and selective decoding of neurons. However, experimental evidence that can dissociate these causes has been lacking. Here, we take advantage of a peculiar pattern of CPs exhibited by multisensory neurons that represent translational self-motion( i. e., heading). Some neurons in areas MSTd( Gu et al., 2006, 2008) and VIP( Chen et al., 2013) have matched heading preferences in response to visual and vestibular stimuli( ‘congruent’ cells), whereas others prefer widely disparate headings( ‘opposite’ cells). Opposite cells could be decoded such that they provide evidence in favor of either their visual or their vestibular heading preference. We showed previously that congruent and opposite cells have CPs with opposite polarities in a visual heading discrimination task( Gu et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2013), and we suggested that this may result from selectively decoding both congruent and opposite cells according to their vestibular heading preferences( Gu et al., 2008). This system provides a valuable test bed for exploring the roles of noise correlations and selective decoding in producing CPs. Using simulations, we explore whether the peculiar pattern of CPs exhibited by multisensory neurons can be explained solely by correlated noise or whether selective decoding is also involved. Our results suggest that selective decoding can play important roles in shaping the pattern of CPs across a population of sensory neurons.Discussion:Choice probability measures the trial-by-trial correlation between the activity of a single neuron and perceptual decisions. While the measurement itself is straightforward, the interpretation of CPs has been varied and somewhat controversial( Nienborg and Cumming, 2010; Nienborg et al., 2012). One possible interpretation of a significant CP is that variability in the response of a sensory neuron drives variability in perceptual decisions across trials—this is the so-called ‘bottom-up’ interpretation( Parker and Newsome, 1998). If this were true, then CPs would at least partially reflect the contribution of each neuron to the decision, and would be shaped by selective decoding of sensory signals. Along these lines, some studies have suggested that the pattern of CPs observed reflects the strategy by which sensory signals are decoded to perform specific tasks( Uka and DeAngelis, 2004; Purushothaman and Bradley, 2005; Gu et al., 2007, 2008). Somewhat analogous conclusions were drawn in a previous study which showed that ‘detect probabilities’ depend on tuning preferences in a change-detection task, which may also be compatible with the notion of selective decoding( Bosking and Maunsell, 2011). An alternative( but not mutually exclusive) possibility is that CPs are mainly driven by top-down feedback signals from parts of the brain involved in making decisions( Nienborg and Cumming, 2009, 2010). If this is the case, then the pattern of CPs need not be directly related to the way that sensory signals are decoded to perform a task. Regardless of the relative roles of bottom-up and top-down signals in generating CPs, it is broadly recognized that CPs should not be observable in large neural populations unless noise is correlated among neurons( Shadlen et al., 1996; Cohen and Newsome, 2009; Nienborg and Cumming, 2010; Cohen and Kohn, 2011; Nienborg et al., 2012). Indeed, a recent study( Liu et al., 2013) provided the first experimental evidence that the difference in magnitude of CPs between two brain areas coincides with a difference in the structure of correlated noise between areas. The controversy regarding whether CPs can reflect decoding strategy or just correlated noise was recently resolved by an important theoretical study( Haefner et al., 2013), which shows that CPs are determined by both factors. However, whether the pattern of CPs in a population reflects decoding strategy or not will depend on the specific details of the decoding weights, correlation structure, population size, etc. This theory shows that the decoding weights could be inferred from CPs if the full structure of correlated noise is known with sufficient accuracy and precision. Using multisensory heading perception as a model system, we show that the pattern of CPs exhibited by neurons in area MSTd is more compatible with a model in which both selective decoding and correlated noise contribute to the generation of CPs than a model in which CPs are determined solely from correlations. Multisensory representations may have advantages for studying CPs because of the presence of neurons that show opposite tuning for the two cues. If such neurons are decoded as providing evidence in favor of either their visual or vestibular heading preference, then the sign of their CP( whether it is > or <0. 5) may reverse depending on the decoding strategy. We suspect that this feature of our model system has provided us with additional leverage to dissociate models that emphasize correlations vs selective decoding. In our selective decoding model, we assume that responses of all MSTd neurons, both congruent and opposite, are decoded relative to their vestibular heading preference. This accounts for opposite cells having CPs <0. 5 in the visual condition, as seen in the real data. Why might responses be decoded according to the vestibular heading preference? One possibility is that this allows the system to estimate heading in a manner that is robust to the presence of moving objects in a scene. Indeed, we have recently shown that a strategy of decoding both congruent and opposite cells according to their vestibular preferences can provide a near-optimal solution to the problem of marginalizing over object motion in order to extract heading in a robust manner( Kim et al., 2014). Moreover, adjusting the relative weighting of opposite to congruent cells can allow the population code to tradeoff robustness to object motion against increased sensitivity during cue integration( Kim et al., 2014). Thus, the selective decoding strategy that we employ here may provide a flexible way to decode self-motion signals efficiently under conditions in which moving objects may or may not distort optic flow.","answer":"Even the simplest tasks require the brain to process vast amounts of information . To take a step forward , for example , the brain must process information about the orientation of the animal\'s body and what the animal is seeing , hearing and feeling in order to determine whether any obstacles stand in the way . The brain must integrate all this information to make decisions about how to proceed . And once a decision is made , the brain must send signals via the nervous system to the muscles to physically move the foot forward . Specialized brain cells called sensory neurons help to process this sensory information . For example , visual neurons process information about what the animal sees , while auditory neurons process information about what it hears . Other sensory neurons—called multisensory neurons—can process information coming from more than one of an animal\'s senses . For more than two decades , researchers have known that the firing of an individual sensory neuron can be linked to the decision that an animal makes about the meaning of the sensory information it has received . The ability to predict whether an animal will make a given decision based on the firing of individual sensory neurons is often referred to as a ‘choice probability’ . Measurements of single neurons have often been used to try to work out how the brain decodes the sensory information that is needed to carry out a specific task . However , it remains unclear whether choice probabilities really reflect how sensory information is decoded in the brain , or whether these measurements are just reflecting coordinated patterns of background ‘noise’ among the neurons as the decisions are being made . Gu et al . set out to help resolve this debate by examining choice probabilities in the multisensory neurons in one area of the brain . A series of experiments was conducted to see how these neurons process information , both from the eyes and the part of the inner ear that helps control balance , to work out the direction in which an animal was moving . By performing computer simulations of the activity of groups of neurons , Gu et al . found that choice probability measurements are better explained by the models whereby these measurements did reflect the strategy that is used to decode the sensory information . Models based solely on patterns of correlated noise did not explain the data as well , though Gu et al . suggest that this noise is likely to also contribute to the observed effects . Following on from the work of Gu et al . , a major challenge will be to see if it is possible to infer how the brain extracts the relevant information from the different sensory neurons . This may require recordings from large groups of neurons , but it might help us to decipher how patterns of activity in the brain lead to decisions about the world around us ."},{"question":"As I endeavor to execute a Spark Streaming program within my computational cluster, I\'m encountering a \'Task not serializable\' anomaly. Could you illuminate the optimal configuration of the serialization procedure to guarantee uninterrupted functionality within the Spark ecosystem, taking into account potential impediments and suggesting the most effective remedies? This should encompass a systematic, logical analysis of the predicament, pinpointing the fundamental origin of the malfunction, and providing a protective measure against analogous complications in forthcoming situations. Furthermore, could you also ponder the potential impact of diverse Spark iterations and the role of ancillary libraries in this circumstance?","answer":"Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream that can be easily transmitted across a network or saved into persistent storage (like disks). In a distributed computing environment like Apache Spark, it is necessary because data must be transferred over the network to different nodes in the cluster and it needs to be in a form that can be easily shared and consumed.The \'Task not serializable\' exception generally occurs when you are trying to operate on a non-serializable object in a transformation or action which you\'ve defined. This problem usually arises because the closure of an RDD operation (a transformation or action) contains a reference to an object that is not serializable. If you look at the stack trace, it should give you a line number indicating what object is not serializable.To resolve this issue, you could:1. Make the non-serializable object `transient`, if possible. This would declare to the Java Virtual Machine that this field doesn\'t need to be serialized, thus eliminating any exceptions when Spark tries to do so.2. Use local variables within your transformations. These would automatically be serializable and wouldn’t cause issues.3. Implement the Serialization interface for your custom objects. That would then enforce you to override `writeObject(OutputStream)` and `readObject(InputStream)`, giving you full control over how your objects are serialized and deserialized.The impact of different Spark versions mainly revolves around performance improvement and there are no significant changes related to serialization from Spark 1.x to 3.x. However, starting from Spark 2.y dependencies for external libraries such as Kryo, javax.servlet are no more packed inside Spark and need to be explicitly provided.Auxiliary libraries can certainly aid in the serialization process; for example, the Kryo serialization library is often a beneficial tool. Kryo is a fast and efficient object graph serialization framework for Java. When compared to Java serialization, Kryo can reduce the size of output data and improve the performance of your Spark programs. It can serialize anything that is JDK serializable and has many features not found in the standard JDK, but is not compatible with it. Be cautious though, Kryo might not be compatible with all cases (e.g., when using lambda functions).Remember to configure Spark to use Kryo serialization by setting the SparkConf like:```scalaval conf = new SparkConf().setMaster(...).setAppName(...)conf.set(\\"spark.serializer\\", \\"org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer\\")```Testing is key to any Spark application as serialization problems often appear only in runtime. A good approach is to serialize and deserialize your object using your selected serialization API to check if any exceptions are thrown."},{"question":"I try to combine two dataframes with the following code:data = data.merge(test_data, on=[\'Date\',\'About\'], how=\'left\')data columns:Date About Duration_training RPE_training ...test_data columns:Date About T-test Yoyo Heart_Rate(max)....I want to combine these two dataframes into one.The data dataframe consists of all the days that the players had a training.

Should we throw exceptions?  Return exceptions serialized as XML?  Just return an error code?Keep in mind that the user will never see these exceptions, it\'s only for other parts of the application.","answer":"In WCF applications, you should not propagate exceptions directly. Instead, you have two options: use FaultContracts or handle them internally and return flags/error messages.FaultContract: In WCF, all exceptions are converted to FaultExceptions before being serialized and sent to the client. This ensures that the exception type is not lost. Besides this, using FaultContract allows you to send predefined exceptions across service boundaries. Each operation contract specifies a list of FaultContract and if there is an exception in the service operation, WCF will check this list and if there is a match will throw this custom exception, otherwise it will throw general FaultException.Handle Internally: If exceptions do not need to be visible to the client, it might make sense to handle them internally and return appropriate status/error messages. This way, it\'s cleaner for the client as they only receive status messages and don\'t have to handle exceptions.In summary, if you want the client to be capable of taking informed decision depending on the type of error occured, then use FaultContracts otherwise handle these exceptions internally in the service and return a status code/message makes more sense.

If a node is the first node in the list, `prev` will be `nullptr`. Similarly, if a node is the last one, `next` will be `nullptr`.Please note that in reality, you would also have to include deletion mechanisms and handle cases when same value is inserted multiple times which may cause issues with hash map, depending on your use case."},{"question":"Develop a function to calculate the heat index, rounded to the nearest integer, considering the relative humidity percentage and the air temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.

The driver communicates with the cluster manager to allocate resources and schedule tasks. The driver is also responsible for maintaining information about the Spark Application and responding to a user\'s program or input.In \'cluster\' mode, the driver program is launched on one of the worker nodes along with executor tasks, and the submitter node goes away once the application is running.

The task requires you to take an `m x n` `matrix` and generate a new matrix, `answer`, where `answer[row][col]` signifies the rank of `matrix[row][col]`.The rank is a numerical value that indicates the relative size of an element in comparison to other elements. It is computed according to the following guidelines:The rank begins as an integer from `1`.If two elements `p` and `q` exist in the same row or column, then:\\tIf `p &lt; q` then `rank(p) &lt; rank(q)`If `p == q` then `rank(p) == rank(q)`If `p &gt; q` then `rank(p) &gt; rank(q)`The rank should be as minimal as possible.It is assured that `answer` is unique under these rules.For instance, consider the following examples:Example 1:Input: matrix = [[1,2],[3,4]]Output: [[1,2],[2,3]]Explanation:The rank of matrix[0][0] is 1 because it is the smallest integer in its row and column.The rank of matrix[0][1] is 2 because matrix[0][1] &gt; matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][0] is rank 1.The rank of matrix[1][0] is 2 because matrix[1][0] &gt; matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][0] is rank 1.The rank of matrix[1][1] is 3 because matrix[1][1] &gt; matrix[0][1], matrix[1][1] &gt; matrix[1][0], and both matrix[0][1] and matrix[1][0] are rank 2.Constraints:`m == matrix.length``n == matrix[i].length``1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 500``-109 &lt;= matrix[row][col] &lt;= 109`","answer":"To solve this task of generating a rank transform of a matrix, we need to track the ranks of each cell in the matrix.

In mathematical expressions, mu_4 geq sigma^4. This property is directly connected to the fact that all central moments are non-negative. The fourth moment involves the fourth power, which will increase the distance between each observation and the mean, placing more weight on outlier values.To make it more clear, let\'s go through the definition of the fourth central moment:mu_4 = E[(X-mu)^4] = sigma^4 + 3[E(X-mu)^2]^2The second term on the right side of the equation is non negative (it\'s a square), so it is clear that:mu_4 geq sigma^4Therefore, you can conclude that the variance of the sample variance cannot be negative, since mu_4 - frac{n-3}{n-1}sigma^4 geq 0."},{"question":"write this code in c#, please:def convert_to_lowercase_remove_digits_and_special_chars(text):\\"\\"\\"convert_to_lowercase_remove_digits_and_special_chars is a function that accepts a string and returns a string that has been converted to lowercase, devoid of digits and any special characters.\\"\\"\\"return \'\'.join(c for c in text if c.isalpha()).lower()print(convert_to_lowercase_remove_digits_and_special_chars(\\"abcdefnghijklm1\\"))print(convert_to_lowercase_remove_digits_and_special_chars(\'abcDEF3\'))print(convert_to_lowercase_remove_digits_and_special_chars(\'AAAAA4\'))print(convert_to_lowercase_remove_digits_and_special_chars(\'AaBAA5\'))print(convert_to_lowercase_remove_digits_and_special_chars(\'zbcd@#%^6\'))","answer":"Here is the C# version of the provided Python code:```csharpusing System;using System.Linq;public class Program{    public static void Main()    {        Console.WriteLine(ConvertToLowerCaseRemoveDigitsAndSpecialChars(\\"abcdefnghijklm1\\"));        Console.WriteLine(ConvertToLowerCaseRemoveDigitsAndSpecialChars(\\"abcDEF3\\"));        Console.WriteLine(ConvertToLowerCaseRemoveDigitsAndSpecialChars(\\"AAAAA4\\"));        Console.WriteLine(ConvertToLowerCaseRemoveDigitsAndSpecialChars(\\"AaBAA5\\"));        Console.WriteLine(ConvertToLowerCaseRemoveDigitsAndSpecialChars(\\"zbcd@#%^6\\"));    }    private static string ConvertToLowerCaseRemoveDigitsAndSpecialChars(string text)    {        return new string(text.Where(c => Char.IsLetter(c)).ToArray()).ToLower();    }}```This code first uses LINQ `Where` method to filter out non-letter characters from the string, then calls the `ToLower` method to convert all letters to lowercase.

It could happen?","answer":"Yes, you can definitely get good results even if you don\'t apply activation functions to the hidden layers and only apply to the output layer. However, this is not the common practice and may not give you optimum results in some cases.The reason we apply activation functions in the intermediate or the hidden layers is to introduce non-linearity in the model. Most of the real-world data is non-linear, and if you don\'t apply activation functions in the hidden layers, the whole network would act just like a single-layer perceptron (because sum of linear functions is still a linear function). This may limit its ability to learn complex patterns from the data.However, in your case, since you\'ve used a pre-trained model, the hidden layers of your model have already learned a lot of complex features from the original dataset which was used to train it. Therefore, you were able to achieve good results even without using activation functions in the added layers, as they were serving primarily to classify pre-extracted features, rather than learn them.But again, it may not be the case for every dataset, and your results might improve if you also include activation functions in the additional layers. You should experiment with adding them and compare the performance."},{"question":"What represents the paramount, most streamlined method for array organization, specifically in the context of the C programming language?","answer":"Sorting an array is a form of array organization that can be accomplished through various sorting algorithms. The choice of algorithm often depends on the specific requirements such as the size of the array and the order of initial elements.The most efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm in theoretical computer science is considered to be quicksort, with a time complexity of O(n log n) in the average case. However, quicksort has the drawback of having a worst-case time complexity of O(n²). Merge sort also runs in O(n log n) time in all cases, but has the disadvantage of requiring O(n) auxiliary space.In special cases, more efficient sorting can be achieved. For example, for an array of integers where the range of possible values is limited, counting sort can sort the array in O(n) time. Beyond that, radix sort and bucket sort can also offer O(n) complexity under certain specific conditions. Here\'s a basic implementation of quicksort in C:```c#include <stdio.h>void swap(int* a, int* b) {    int t = *a;    *a = *b;    *b = t;}int partition (int arr[], int low, int high) {    int pivot = arr[high];    int i = (low - 1);    for (int j = low; j <= high- 1; j++) {        if (arr[j] <= pivot) {            i++;            swap(&arr[i], &arr[j]);        }    }    swap(&arr[i + 1], &arr[high]);    return (i + 1);}void quickSort(int arr[], int low, int high) {    if (low < high) {        int pi = partition(arr, low, high);        quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);        quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high);    }}```However, as stated earlier, the best sorting algorithm to choose depends on your specific use case and constraints."},{"question":"Write a JavaScript code to compare two objects and print out the key-value pair in both if it is the same.obj1 = { name: “Syeda”, age: 25, city: “New York”} obj2 = { name: “Syeda”, age: 28, city: “Los Angeles”}","answer":"Here is a simple JavaScript code to compare two objects and print out the key-value pair which is the same.```javascriptlet obj1 = {    name: \\"Syeda\\",    age: 25,    city: \\"New York\\"}let obj2 = {    name: \\"Syeda\\",    age: 28,    city: \\"Los Angeles\\"}for (let key in obj1) {    if (obj1[key] === obj2[key]) {        console.log(`{key}: {obj1[key]}`);    }}```In this code, we are using a for...in loop to iterate over the keys in the first object.

Furthermore, does a notable constraint of Q-learning reside in its inherent requirement for the learner to possess preliminary understanding concerning the potential effects of its actions on the surrounding environment?","answer":"Yes, we can assert with certainty that the expectation maximization algorithm invariably increases the log-likelihood with each progressive interaction. The algorithm operates on the principle of maximizing the expected value of the log-likelihood with each step and is guaranteed to either increase the log-likelihood or leave it unchanged.In terms of Q-learning, it is not necessarily a requirement for the learner to have a preliminary understanding concerning the potential effects of its actions on the environment. Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning technique, which means it learns from actions without any knowledge about the environment\'s underlying state transition probabilities. It generally starts with an arbitrary value and updates the action-values (Q-values) based on the received rewards from the environment along with the maximum predicted future rewards.

More studies are needed in bats to help these efforts. In the meantime, the experiments highlight the importance of warning people to avoid direct contact with wild bats. up resource supply of infection-susceptible host cells, were first developed for HIV (Perelson, 2002) but have since been applied to other chronic infections, including hepatitis-C virus (Neumann et al., 1998) , hepatitis-B virus (Nowak et al., 1996) and cytomegalovirus (Emery et al., 1999) . Recent work has adopted similar techniques to model the within-host dynamics of acute infections, such as influenza A and measles, inspiring debate over the extent to which explicit modeling of top-down immune control can improve inference beyond the basic resource limitation assumptions of the target cell model (Baccam et al., 2006; Pawelek et al., 2012; Saenz et al., 2010; Morris et al., 2018) . To investigate the impact of unique bat immune processes on in vitro viral kinetics, we first undertook a series of virus infection experiments on bat cell lines expressing divergent interferon phenotypes, then developed a theoretical model elucidating the dynamics of within-host viral spread. We evaluated our theoretical model analytically independent of the data, then fit the model to data recovered from in vitro experimental trials in order to estimate rates of within-host virus transmission and cellular progression to antiviral status under diverse assumptions of absent, induced, and constitutive immunity. Finally, we confirmed our findings in spatially-explicit stochastic simulations of fitted time series from our mean field model. We hypothesized that top-down immune processes would overrule classical resource-limitation in bat cell lines described as constitutively antiviral in the literature, offering a testable prediction for models fit to empirical data. We further predicted that the most robust antiviral responses would be associated with the most rapid within-host virus propagation rates but also protect cells against virus-induced mortality to support the longest enduring infections in tissue culture. We first explored the influence of innate immune phenotype on within-host viral propagation in a series of infection experiments in cell culture. We conducted plaque assays on six-well plate monolayers of three immortalized mammalian kidney cell lines: [1] Vero (African green monkey) cells, which are IFN-defective and thus limited in antiviral capacity (Desmyter et al., 1968) ; [2] RoNi/7.1 (Rousettus aegyptiacus) cells which demonstrate idiosyncratic induced interferon responses upon viral challenge (Kuzmin et al., 2017; Arnold et al., 2018; Biesold et al., 2011; Pavlovich et al., 2018) ; and [3] PaKiT01 (Pteropus alecto) cells which constitutively express IFN-a (Zhou et al., 2016; Crameri et al., 2009) . To intensify cell line-specific differences in constitutive immunity, we carried out infectivity assays with GFP-tagged, replication-competent vesicular stomatitis Indiana viruses: rVSV-G, rVSV-EBOV, and rVSV-MARV, which have been previously described (Miller et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2010) . Two of these viruses, rVSV-EBOV and rVSV-MARV, are recombinants for which cell entry is mediated by the glycoprotein of the bat-evolved filoviruses, Ebola (EBOV) and Marburg (MARV), thus allowing us to modulate the extent of structural, as well as immunological, antiviral defense at play in each infection. Previous work in this lab has demonstrated incompatibilities in the NPC1 filovirus receptor which render PaKiT01 cells refractory to infection with rVSV-MARV (Ng and Chandrab, 2018, Unpublished results) , making them structurally antiviral, over and above their constitutive expression of IFN-a. All three cell lines were challenged with all three viruses at two multiplicities of infection (MOI): 0.001 and 0.0001. Between 18 and 39 trials were run at each cell-virus-MOI combination, excepting rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells at MOI = 0.001, for which only eight trials were run (see Materials and methods; Figure 1 -figure supplements 1-3, Supplementary file 1). Because plaque assays restrict viral transmission neighbor-to-neighbor in two-dimensional cellular space (Howat et al., 2006) , we were able to track the spread of GFP-expressing virus-infected cells across tissue monolayers via inverted fluorescence microscopy. For each infection trial, we monitored and re-imaged plates for up to 200 hr of observations or until total monolayer destruction, processed resulting images, and generated a time series of the proportion of infectious-cell occupied plate space across the duration of each trial (see Materials and methods). We used generalized additive models to infer the time course of all cell culture replicates and construct the multi-trial dataset to which we eventually fit our mechanistic transmission model for each cell line-virus-specific combination ( Figure 1; Figure 1 -figure supplements 1-5). All three recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSV-G, rVSV-EBOV, and rVSV-MARV) infected Vero, RoNi/7.1, and PaKiT01 tissue cultures at both focal MOIs. Post-invasion, virus spread rapidly across most cell monolayers, resulting in virus-induced epidemic extinction. Epidemics were less severe in bat cell cultures, especially when infected with the recombinant filoviruses, rVSV-EBOV and rVSV-MARV. Monolayer destruction was avoided in the case of rVSV-EBOV and rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells: in the former, persistent viral infection was maintained throughout the 200 hr duration of each experiment, while, in the latter, infection was eliminated early in the time series, preserving a large proportion of live, uninfectious cells across the duration of the experiment. We assumed this pattern to be the result of immune-mediated epidemic extinction (Figure 1) . Patterns from MOI = 0.001 were largely recapitulated at MOI = 0.0001, though at somewhat reduced total proportions (Figure 1-figure supplement 5 ). A theoretical model fit to in vitro data recapitulates expected immune phenotypes for bat cells We next developed a within-host model to fit to these data to elucidate the effects of induced and constitutive immunity on the dynamics of viral spread in host tissue ( Figure 1 ). The compartmental within-host system mimicked our two-dimensional cell culture monolayer, with cells occupying five distinct infection states: susceptible (S), antiviral (A), exposed (E), infectious (I), and dead (D). We modeled exposed cells as infected but not yet infectious, capturing the \'eclipse phase\' of viral integration into a host cell which precedes viral replication. Antiviral cells were immune to viral infection, in accordance with the \'antiviral state\' induced from interferon stimulation of ISGs in tissues adjacent to infection (Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006) . Because we aimed to translate available data into modeled processes, we did not explicitly model interferon dynamics but instead scaled the rate of cell progression from susceptible to antiviral (r) by the proportion of exposed cells (globally) in the system. In systems permitting constitutive immunity, a second rate of cellular acquisition of antiviral status (\\") additionally scaled with the global proportion of susceptible cells in the model. Compared with virus, IFN particles are small and highly diffusive, justifying this global signaling assumption at the limited spatial extent of a six-well plate and maintaining consistency with previous modeling approximations of IFN signaling in plaque assay (Howat et al., 2006) . To best represent our empirical monolayer system, we expressed our state variables as proportions (P S , P A , P E , P I , and P D ), under assumptions of frequency-dependent transmission in a wellmixed population (Keeling and Rohani, 2008) , though note that the inclusion of P D (representing the proportion of dead space in the modeled tissue) had the functional effect of varying transmission with infectious cell density. This resulted in the following system of ordinary differential equations:We defined \'induced immunity\' as complete, modeling all cells as susceptible to viral invasion at disease-free equilibrium, with defenses induced subsequent to viral exposure through the term r. By contrast, we allowed the extent of constitutive immunity to vary across the parameter range of \\" > 0, defining a \'constitutive\' system as one containing any antiviral cells at disease-free equilibrium. In fitting this model to tissue culture data, we independently estimated both r and \\"; as well as the cell-to-cell transmission rate, b, for each cell-virus combination. Since the extent to which constitutively-expressed IFN-a is constitutively translated into functional protein is not yet known for bat hosts (Zhou et al., 2016) , this approach permitted our tissue culture data to drive modeling inference: even in PaKiT01 cell lines known to constitutively express IFN-a, the true constitutive extent of the system (i.e. the quantity of antiviral cells present at disease-free equilibrium) was allowed to vary through estimation of \\": For the purposes of model-fitting, we fixed the value of c, the return rate of antiviral cells to susceptible status, at 0. The small spatial scale and short time course (max 200 hours) of our experiments likely prohibited any return of antiviral cells to susceptible status in our empirical system; nonetheless, we retained the term c in analytical evaluations of our model because regression from antiviral to susceptible status is possible over long time periods in vitro and at the scale of a complete organism (Radke et al., 1974; Rasmussen and Farley, 1975; Samuel and Knutson, 1982) . Before fitting to empirical time series, we undertook bifurcation analysis of our theoretical model and generated testable hypotheses on the basis of model outcomes. From our within-host model system (Equation 1-5), we derived the following expression for R 0 , the pathogen basic reproduction number (Supplementary file 2):Pathogens can invade a host tissue culture when R 0 >1. Rapid rates of constitutive antiviral acquisition (\\") will drive R 0 <1: tissue cultures with highly constitutive antiviral immunity will be therefore resistant to virus invasion from the outset. Since, by definition, induced immunity is stimulated following initial virus invasion, the rate of induced antiviral acquisition (r) is not incorporated into the equation for R 0 ; while induced immune processes can control virus after initial invasion, they cannot prevent it from occurring to begin with. In cases of fully induced or absent immunity (\\" ¼ 0), the R 0 equation thus reduces to a form typical of the classic SEIR model:At equilibrium, the theoretical, mean field model demonstrates one of three infection states: endemic equilibrium, stable limit cycles, or no infection ( Figure 2) . Respectively, these states approximate the persistent infection, virus-induced epidemic extinction, and immune-mediated epidemic extinction phenotypes previously witnessed in tissue culture experiments ( Figure 1 ). Theoretically, endemic equilibrium is maintained when new infections are generated at the same rate at which infections are lost, while limit cycles represent parameter space under which infectious and susceptible populations are locked in predictable oscillations. Endemic equilibria resulting from cellular regeneration (i.e. births) have been described in vivo for HIV (Coffin, 1995) and in vitro for herpesvirus plaque assays (Howat et al., 2006) , but, because they so closely approach zero, true limit cycles likely only occur theoretically, instead yielding stochastic extinctions in empirical time series. Bifurcation analysis of our mean field model revealed that regions of no infection (pathogen extinction) were bounded at lower threshold (Branch point) values for b, below which the pathogen was unable to invade. We found no upper threshold to invasion for b under any circumstances (i.e. b high enough to drive pathogen-induced extinction), but high b values resulted in Hopf bifurcations, which delineate regions of parameter space characterized by limit cycles. Since limit cycles so closely approach zero, high bs recovered in this range would likely produce virus-induced epidemic extinctions under experimental conditions. Under more robust representations of immunity, with higher values for either or both induced (r) and constitutive (\\") rates of antiviral acquisition, Hopf bifurcations occurred at increasingly higher values for b, meaning that persistent infections could establish at higher viral transmission rates ( Figure 2 ). Consistent with our derivation for R 0 , we found that the Branch point threshold for viral invasion was independent of changes to the induced immune parameter (r) but saturated at high values of \\" that characterize highly constitutive immunity ( Figure 3) . We next fit our theoretical model by least squares to each cell line-virus combination, under absent, induced, and constitutive assumptions of immunity. In general, best fit models recapitulated expected outcomes based on the immune phenotype of the cell line in question, as described in the general literature (Table 1 Ironically, the induced immune model offered a slightly better fit than the constitutive to rVSV-MARV infections on the PaKiT01 cell line (the one cell line-virus combination for which we know a constitutively antiviral cell-receptor incompatibility to be at play). Because constitutive immune assumptions can prohibit pathogen invasion (R 0 <1), model fits to this time series under constitutive assumptions were handicapped by overestimations of \\", which prohibited pathogen invasion. Only by incorporating an exceedingly rapid rate of induced antiviral acquisition could the model guarantee that initial infection would be permitted and then rapidly controlled. In all panel (A) plots, the rate of induced immune antiviral acquisition (r) was fixed at 0.01. Panel (B) depicts dynamics under variably induced immunity, ranging from absent (left: r=0) to high (right: r=1). In all panel (B) plots, the rate of constitutive antiviral acquisition (\\") was fixed at 0.0001 Branch point curves are represented as solid lines and Hopf curves as dashed lines. White space indicates endemic equilibrium (persistence), gray space indicates limit cycles, and black space indicates no infection (extinction). Other parameter values for equilibrium analysis were fixed at: b = .025, m = .001, s = 1/6, c = 0. Special points from bifurcations analyses are listed in Supplementary file 3. In fitting our theoretical model to in vitro data, we estimated the within-host virus transmission rate (b) and the rate(s) of cellular acquisition to antiviral status (r or r + \\") ( Table 1 ; Supplementary file 4).Question: What would be the benefit of learning more about bat\'s defenses and how they  drive virus evolution?","answer":"help scientists develop better ways to predict, prevent or limit the spread of viruses from bats to humans."},{"question":"Create a function that necessitates two arguments, a list of whole numbers and a whole number.

Sublime Text: Sublime allows you to change its settings to use any font installed on your system. It might not be as feature-rich as Visual Studio, but it does allow a lot of control over the look of your code.Unfortunately, the support for proportional fonts and different styles is not very common in IDEs due to the difficulties and inconsistencies it could bring in reading and writing code. For instance, variable width fonts could lead to confusion about the number of spaces or indentation levels.As you mentioned building it yourself, creating an extension for Visual Studio might be your best bet. You could create a Visual Studio extension that allows changing the font, font size, and maybe even font color or background color of the editor. There are many resources available online such as videos and documentation to help you get started with creating Visual Studio extensions.If you do not want to start from scratch, some open-source text editors like Atom and brackets, have highly customizable designs. They allow you to create your styles with a little knowledge of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. You could add the features you desire on top of one of these systems.

In mice, Intracisternal A Particles( IAPs) are a frequent source of both new mutations and polymorphism across laboratory strains. Intronic IAPs can induce alternative RNA processing choices, including alternative splicing. We previously showed IAP I∆1 subfamily insertional mutations are suppressed by a wild-derived allele of the major mRNA export factor, Nxf1. Here we show that a wider diversity of IAP insertions present in the mouse reference sequence induce insertion-dependent alternative processing that is suppressed by Nxf1CAST alleles. These insertions typically show more modest gene expression changes than de novo mutations, suggesting selection or attenuation. Genome-wide splicing-sensitive microarrays and gene-focused assays confirm specificity of Nxf1 genetic modifier activity for IAP insertion alleles. Strikingly, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing demonstrates that a single amino acid substitution in Nxf1, E610G, is sufficient to recreate a quantitative genetic modifier in a co-isogenic background.Introduction:Endogenized retroviruses and other molecular parasites frequently influence expression of host genes at sites of insertion. Chromosomal insertions of these mobile elements can alter initiation, splicing, or termination of host gene transcripts, in quality or amount. Remnants of ancient insertion and transposition events that survived selection are thought to have shaped gene expression patterns in modern animals substantially[1–3]. In populations where mobile elements remain highly active, such events can account for a substantial fraction of functional polymorphism and spontaneous mutations. Two families of elements in laboratory mice, Intracisternal A Particle( IAP) and MusD/Early Transposon( ETn) families account for 10–20% of spontaneous mutations[4–6], depending on strain background[6]. While some of these mutations interrupt coding exons[7] or induce novel patterns of transcription[8–11], the majority comprise intronic insertions that introduce alternative splicing or transcript termination( or both), resulting in quantitative loss of normal host gene products. Alternative processing of nascent transcripts is regulated at several levels[12]. Pre-mRNA splicing typically occurs co-transcriptionally, regulated by a variety of DNA and RNA binding factors that together defines and acts on constitutive exons. Transcriptional initiation complexes may assemble splicing factors on the Pol II complex, resulting in promoter-dependent alternative splicing[13–15]. Elongation rate of the RNA polymerase complex may influence alternative splicing by regulating the appearance of downstream acceptor sites relative to the splicing kinetics for weaker upstream sites[16, 17]. In addition, recent single-molecule imaging data supports post-transcriptional splicing for at least some alternative splice sites[18]. Identification of post-transcriptional alternative splicing events suggests opportunities for regulation by nuclear ribonucleoprotein( RNP)-associated proteins that are not normally found in the nuclear speckles associated with constitutive splicing. We previously reported a wild-derived variant of the mouse mRNA nuclear export factor gene Nxf1 within the Modifier-of-vibrator-1( Mvb1) locus as a genetic modifier for each of six mutations caused by insertion of an IAP element into an intron of a host gene[19, 20]. The suppressing allele, Nxf1CAST, defines the major haplotype in wild isolates of Mus musculus castaneus. For each of the six mutations, genetic suppression altered the balance of alternative RNA processing between virus-dependent isoforms and splicing to the 3’ exon. This mechanism appeared highly selective, operating on sense-strand IAPs( six out of seven tested), but not MusD/ETn( 0/6), MuLV( 0/1), VL30( 0/1), or L1 LINE( 0/1) insertions. These studies also identified an exception to the rule: AtrnmgL, which includes a “full-length” IAP, was not suppressed, in contrast to the more frequent IΔ1 class[21] in the six suppressed mutations[19]. We proposed that sequences deleted in IΔ1 elements might in full-length elements mediate additional repressive events that are epistatic to the apparent splicing defects modified by Nxf1CAST, but acknowledged that local genomic context could also play a role. We also proposed that Nxf1CAST effects on alternative splicing are highly specific, but genome-wide analysis of Nxf1CAST effects on either general alternative splicing or alternative splicing at genes whose reference allele includes an IAP element have not been reported. Here we show that Nxf1CAST has modifier gene activity toward IAP insertion alleles present in the C57BL/6J( B6) reference genome–this includes several full-length IAPs, an IAP in Adamts13 with a novel deletion but otherwise high sequence similarity to the non-suppressed element in AtrnmgL, and two other IAP deletion classes outside of the IΔ1 group. Quantification of well-characterized alternative splicing events, including cassette exon, retained intron, alternative splice donor, and alternative splice acceptor sites detect no Nxf1 modifier effect at non-IAP introns, further supporting the specificity of Nxf1CAST activity toward IAP insertion alleles. We also demonstrate by genome editing that a single nucleotide substitution, encoding a glutamate to glycine amino acid replacement in the carboxyterminal UBA-like domain, is sufficient to explain the semi-dominant modifier phenotype of Nxf1CAST. These results expand the range of IAP family elements modified by Nxf1 variant alleles and identify a single residue in Nxf1 protein whose effect on stability, kinetics, or interactions explain the modifier mechanism.Discussion:As far as we are aware, Nxf1 remains the most highly-connected node for genetic interactions among modifier genes that act on either natural or chemically-induced mutations in mice[19, 42]. The current results add three times as many allele-specific genetic interactions for Mvb1 alleles of Nxf1( CAST and E610G) as had previously been reported. We previously showed that the most common Mus musculus castaneus allele of Nxf1, containing many polymorphic sites, suppressed the classical vibrator mutation[20] and that a congenic stock including this allele suppressed several other IΔ1 IAP insertional mutations[19]. Our results extend the diversity of IAP insertions susceptible to Nxf1 substantially beyond the IΔ1 subfamily( Fig. 2) and provide further evidence against activity on alternative processing at non-IAP introns( Fig. 3). Alternative events suppressed by Nxf1 alleles include known bleeding exons with alternative termination, such as Slc15a2[43] and Trpc6[30], and IAP-dependent alternative splicing, such as Adamts13[27, 44] and Cpne8, as well as introns for which public transcriptome data do not indicate a predominant alternative variant. Comparison of IAP elements whose effects can be suppressed by Nxf1 alleles further suggests minimum sequence requirements for both mutation and suppression lie in <1 kb in the 5’ end and ~1 kb in the 3’ end of the IAP( Fig. 7), although construction and experimental measurements of a minimal element will be required to test this idea. In contrast to most de novo mutations caused by IAP insertions, the magnitude of gene expression changes is relatively modest for most of the B6-endogenous IAP sites we tested( Fig. 2). Indeed, recent evaluation of mouse transposable elements concluded that insertion events that strongly affected gene expression were rapidly purged from populations, hence remaining elements tend toward more modest effect sizes[45]. Adamts13 is a notable exception, with ~1000-fold change in completion of the transcript across the inserted intron( Fig. 1). However, as the truncated Adamts13 encoded by the major B6 transcript retains substantial function[44, 46] and the absolute level of full-length transcript recovered by suppression is modest, little physiological consequence is expected from this increase in full-length Adamts13 protein above the level of function provided by the abundant truncated form. Taken all together the data suggest that using IAP insertional mutations in combination with Nxf1 suppressing alleles should allow relatively clean titrations of intermediate gene doses. This may have application in modeling genetic disorders( and therapeutics) in mice. Our results using genome-edited mice provide molecular precision to the definition of the modifier allele. Although several polymorphisms distinguish Nxf1B6 and Nxf1CAST alleles in both transgenic[20] and congenic[19] experiments, the E610G single amino acid substitution( Fig. 4) was sufficient for the full range of genetic modifier activity previously ascribed to the congenic locus and published 16 kb transgene. The point mutation modified all of the principle features of the vibrator mutation on which the modifier activity was first described[47] with the characteristic semi-dominant effect( Fig. 5). The ability to assay the edited allele as a heterozygote with respect to congenic Nxf1B6 and Nxf1CAST alleles and the specificity of multiple phenotypes assayed( Figs. 5, 6) also provides an additional safeguard against potential off-target modifications in the editing process. Our results demonstrate that a single amino acid substitution in the C-terminal, UBA-like domain of Nxf1 simultaneously enhances expression of full-length mRNA at more than a dozen loci in the mouse reference genome at the level of pre-mRNA processing. This illustrates a potential post-transcriptional mechanism for evolution of gene regulatory networks selected from events generated by molecular parasites[3] and provides a post-transcriptional tool for modulating expression level of any mouse gene into which an IAP element can be introduced.","answer":"Transposable elements , including endogenous retroviruses , have long been hypothesized as a substrate for creating or modulating gene regulatory networks , particularly through effects on transcription . However , several classes of elements are also known to affect alternative RNA processing events . We previously showed that the major allele of nuclear export factor Nxf1 in Mus musculus castaneus mice acts as a semi-dominant suppressor of de novo mutations caused by intracisternal A particle ( IAP ) endogenous retroviruses that integrate into introns , disrupting normal RNA processing . Here we show that this suppressor allele of Nxf1 can coordinately modify gene expression phenotypes at several endogenous loci in the C57BL/6 mouse reference genome that contain IAP sequences in their introns . This quadruples the number of known insertional events modified by Nxf1 and extends the effect beyond overt mutations . We previously used transgenic mice and viral vector mediated overexpression to demonstrate Nxf1 as the modifier gene for de novo insertions . Here we use direct genome editing in mouse one cell embryos to create custom germline alleles at the endogenous Nxf1 locus to show that a specific amino acid substitution , E610G , quantitatively accounts for the Nxf1 modifier gene activity ."},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

To date, the identification of drugs to therapeutically inhibit K-RAS have been unsuccessful, suggesting that other approaches are required. We demonstrate in both a novel transgenic mutant Kras lung cancer mouse model and in human lung tumors that the inhibition of Twist1 restores a senescence program inducing the loss of a neoplastic phenotype. The Twist1 gene encodes for a transcription factor that is essential during embryogenesis. Twist1 has been suggested to play an important role during tumor progression. However, there is no in vivo evidence that Twist1 plays a role in autochthonous tumorigenesis. Through two novel transgenic mouse models, we show that Twist1 cooperates with KrasG12D to markedly accelerate lung tumorigenesis by abrogating cellular senescence programs and promoting the progression from benign adenomas to adenocarcinomas. Moreover, the suppression of Twist1 to physiological levels is sufficient to cause Kras mutant lung tumors to undergo senescence and lose their neoplastic features. Finally, we analyzed more than 500 human tumors to demonstrate that TWIST1 is frequently overexpressed in primary human lung tumors. The suppression of TWIST1 in human lung cancer cells also induced cellular senescence. Hence, TWIST1 is a critical regulator of cellular senescence programs, and the suppression of TWIST1 in human tumors may be an effective example of pro-senescence therapy.Introduction:Lung cancer is responsible for more cancer deaths in the US than colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer combined with a dismal overall survival of 15%[1]. The majority of human lung cancers are adenocarcinomas carrying somatic mutations in the genes that encode the EGFR/KRAS/BRAF pathway[2]. Observations in both experimental mouse models and human lung tumors strongly suggest that these pathways are causally responsible for lung tumorigenesis[3],[4],[5],[6],[7]. KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinomas are generally refractory to conventional cytotoxic therapies[8] and currently available small molecule targeted agents[9],[10]. Difficulties in pharmacologically targeting K-RAS have resulted in some labeling the protein “undruggable”[11]. Approaches such as using farnesyl transferase inhibitors to prevent prenylation of Ras for its membrane localization have not shown clinical efficacy[12],[13]. Other potential kinase targets for KRAS mutant tumors have been identified through RNAi screens including: TBK1, STK33 and PLK1[14],[15],[16]. Rational candidate based approaches that target key pathways required during the process of tumorigenesis for KRAS mutant cancers have not been exhaustive. One such pathway is oncogene-induced senescence( OIS), a failsafe program that prevents normal cells from progressing towards malignancy following introduction of a mutant form of an oncogene such as KrasG12D[17]. OIS is an irreversible cell cycle arrest that is characterized by cells displaying an enlarged, flattened cytoplasm, increase in senescence associated beta-galactosidase( SA-β-Gal) activity, increased chromatin condensation and changes in gene expression associated with DNA damage checkpoint proteins or cell cycle checkpoint proteins. OIS is thought to be triggered early during tumorigenesis in order to inhibit aberrant cell cycle progression, preventing pre-malignant tumors from progressing to malignancy[17]. OIS seems to be dependent on the p53-p19ARF, p16-Rb and Atf4-p27 pathways to enforce the senescent phenotype, but the requirement of any or all these pathways is highly context dependent[18],[19]. Whether these latent OIS programs can be activated in KRAS mutant cancers to result in a clinical effect has only recently been examined[20],[21]. Recently, Twist1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is central to embryogenesis[22], has been shown to suppress OIS associated with KrasG12D and EGFR2 oncogenes in vitro in MEFs[23] and pancreatic epithelial cells[24]. Twist1 protein expression is usually undetectable in most adult tissues, but has been shown to be overexpressed in cancers including prostate, bladder pancreatic, osteosarcomas, melanomas and breast[25],[26],[27],[28],[29],[30],[31]. The high expression of Twist1 in cancers strongly correlates with invasive and metastatic tumor cells. Twist1 is thought to regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition( EMT) through the down-regulation of key proteins that maintain epithelial cell characteristics and up-regulation of proteins that confer a mesenchymal phenotype[31]. Thus, Twist1 may act both to induce malignancies early in tumorigenesis and also promote tumor progression[32]. To date, there has yet to be reported an autochthonous model to study the role of Twist1 overexpression in the initiation and maintenance of tumorigenesis. Here we report the generation of such a model and through this demonstration we show an important role of Twist1 in suppressing cellular senescence programs.Discussion:Our results dramatize that suppression of TWIST1 may be an effective pro-senescence therapy for human lung cancer. We provide the first in vivo demonstration that Twist1 plays an important role in both the acceleration and maintenance of KrasG12D-induced autochthonous lung tumorigenesis. Our results illustrate that TWIST1 may be an important target for the treatment of human lung adenocarcinoma. We generated two novel autochthonous transgenic mouse models to demonstrate that Twist1 overexpression cooperates with KrasG12D to markedly accelerate the onset of lung adenocarcinoma. Suppression of Twist1 expression to physiological levels is sufficient to induce lung tumor stasis that was associated with the activation of cellular senescence programs. Importantly, through the transcriptional analysis of over 500 human tumors, human TWIST1 was found to be frequently overexpressed and hence highly relevant to primary human lung cancers. Finally, the knockdown of TWIST1 in human KRAS mutant lung tumor cells was also associated with the loss of their neoplastic properties and the induction of cellular senescence. The generality of our results using different cell types and across species suggest TWIST1 is a potential therapeutic target in KRAS mutant lung cancers. Oncogene-induced senescence and oncogene-induced apoptosis represent early tumor suppressive barriers that must be overcome for premalignant cells to ultimately emerge as neoplastic. It had been reported previously that Twist1/2 could suppress mutant Kras-induced OIS in vitro[23],[24], but we report for the first time the ability of Twist1 to suppress OIS in vivo using a novel Twist1 lung model in combination with two complementary KrasG12D–induced autochthonous lung tumor models: the inducible transgenic KrasG12D( CR) model and the conditional endogenous KrasG12D( LSL) model. Our results are confirmed by an accompanying paper demonstrating that Twist1 can also accelerate KrasG12D-induced autochthonous breast tumorigenesis( Morel et. al.). Twist1 co-expression accelerated tumorigenesis relative to KrasG12D alone in both lung tumor models. Twist1 acceleration was more pronounced in the CRT model than the CT-LSL model. One explanation for this difference is the greater strength of oncogenic signaling by transgenic KrasG12D versus endogenous KrasG12D[53]. An alterative explanation is that cell type specific chromatin regulation of tumor suppressor loci such as the Ink4a/Arf locus is a key determinant of whether mutant Kras elicits tumor suppressive responses resulting in apoptosis and/or senescence[54]. Another explanation are strain difference effects as we had to use a mixed background for the CT-LSL mouse experiments. These alternatives are not mutually exclusive and further study using additional tissue specific models of KrasG12D and Twist1 expression are needed to define the mechanistic basis for the differences we observed in oncogenic synergy observed between Twist1 and KrasG12D. The acceleration and progression of KrasG12D-induced lung tumors by Twist1 is reminiscent of that seen with p53 deficiency[3],[44],[45],[55]. Notably, Twist1 may inhibit p53 through several independent mechanisms[23],[56],[57],[58],[59],[60], including direct Twist1-p53 antagonism[61]. One straightforward interpretation of our results is that Twist1 overexpression can phenocopy Trp53 deletion. Twist1 may also accelerate and promote KrasG12D-induced lung tumors by the direct transcriptional regulation of BMI1[62]. As mentioned above, the control of tumor suppressor loci by chromatin regulatory complexes, such as those containing Bmi1, may be a strong determinant of responses to oncogenic signaling[54]. Interestingly, ectopic expression of Twist1 in lung epithelial cells was associated with the induction of an EMT program. Whether the transdifferentiation program might contribute to accelerated tumor initiation, as proposed by Morel et. al., is also an intriguing possibility. Additional studies are required to define the mechanisms by which Twist1 accelerates KrasG12D-induced lung tumors, as well as explain why different tissues exhibit differing cancer susceptibilities despite harboring the same initiating oncogenic event. Twist1 has been commonly implicated in metastasis[32]. Thus, our finding that Twist1 expression did not seem to confer increase distant metastases in either the CRT or CT-LSL autochthonous lung tumor models was surprising. We note that Twist1 appears to confer increased prometastatic ability in other models of tumorigenesis as predicted( D. I. Bellovin, P. T. Tran and D. W. Felsher, unpublished data). Hence, Twist1 may have specific effects on metastatic potential. Our study dramatically illustrates that it is possible to activate a latent senescence program in Kras mutant tumors in vivo by targeting the collaborating oncogene, Twist1. We uncover a newly defined synthetic interaction between mutant Kras and Twist1 resulting not in cell death, but cellular senescence. The activation of this program is evident at the molecular level and most importantly results in marked inhibition of Kras mutant lung tumor growth in vivo. We realize that a possible caveat to this approach is that we first overexpressed Twist1 prior to KrasG12D activation and lung tumor formation and thus may have biased tumors towards dependency for Twist1. However, simply overexpressing an oncogene during tumorigenesis does not per se make tumors dependent or “addicted” to that oncogene as we have shown, in particular for lung tumorigenesis[35],[63]. Finally, we validate that knocking down endogenous TWIST1 in human lung cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo also results in activation of senescence. An alternative approach to inducible overexpression using the TET system as we used in our study would be to use genetic ablation of endogenous Twist1 using the Cre-LoxP or a inducible shRNA system following development of KrasG12D–induced lung tumors. As KrasG12D–induced lung tumors are primarily adenomas with low proliferative rates( Figure 2E and Figure 4F), endogenous Twist1 ablation or knockdown would not likely have an effect as has been shown for p53 restoration in adenomas[44],[45]. From a clinical standpoint complete ablation of a gene, such as in mice using the Cre-LoxP system, is therapeutically not possible in humans. In contrast, the TET model system where we can suppress Twist1 overexpression to physiologic levels is more clinically relevant to what is done in the clinic with inhibitors. Others have shown senescence can arise in vivo in established tumors by targeting an initiating oncogene or reconstitution of a tumor suppressor[21],[64],[65],[66]. Our work further highlights the activation of a latent cellular senescence program or pro-senescence therapy as an innovative avenue for cancer therapy[67]. Our results may extend beyond KRAS-mutant lung cancers. Notably, TWIST1 was found to be overexpressed in a majority of human lung cancer samples we tested. This includes not only adenocarcinoma, in which KRAS mutation is commonly observed, but also other major lung cancer histologies including squamous cell carcinoma, in which KRAS mutation is rare. Our preliminary data suggests that TWIST1 knockdown can result in activation of OIS in KRAS wildtype lung cancer cell lines in vitro, but further characterization of these lines for mutations in other components of the EGFR/KRAS/BRAF pathway are needed( T. F. Burns, P. T. Tran and C. M. Rudin, unpublished data). Furthermore, additional preliminary findings suggest that TWIST1 may have a larger role in suppressing OIS following activation of other key driver mutations using other transgenic mouse lines( P. T. Tran and D. W. Felsher, unpublished data). This hypothesis will be further explored in lung cancer through introduction of our inducible Twist1 construct into other relevant transgenic models of lung tumorigenesis. Importantly, regardless of whether there is an exclusive association between KRAS mutation and TWIST1 overexpression in human lung cancer cells, the data presented strongly support that TWIST1 upregulation in KRAS mutant lung cancer represents a novel and particularly promising therapeutic target. These observations have important and immediate translational implications for this particularly refractory subset of lung cancers. The consequences of systemic transient inhibition of Twist1 in the adult has not been well defined and thus side-effects of such treatment are unknown. Germline deletion of Twist11 in mice is embryonic lethal[22] and loss of function mutations in humans cause a severe developmental disorder. However, postnatal expression of TWIST1 appears to be tightly restricted to a subpopulation of mesoderm derived tissues and limited studies suggest that Twist1 inhibition systemically may be well tolerated[68]. We conclude that TWIST1 may be an effective target for “pro-senescence” therapy for human lung cancers[67]. Our results suggest that it will only be necessary to suppress TWIST1 to a physiological level which may preclude toxicity. Our mouse model will be useful to identify agents that target TWIST1 for the treatment of human cancer.","answer":"Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide .

Hence a given input image (cid:126)x is encoded in each layer of the CNN by the ﬁlter responses to that image. A layer with N l distinct ﬁlters has N l feature maps each of size M l , where M l is the height times the width of the feature map. So the responses in a layer l can be stored in a matrix F l ∈ R N l × M l where F lij is the activation of the i th ﬁlter at position j in layer l . To visualise the image information that is encoded at different layers of the hierarchy (Fig 1, content reconstructions) we perform gradient descent on a white noise image to ﬁnd another image that matches the feature responses of the original image. So let (cid:126)p and (cid:126)x be the original image and the image that is generated and P l and F l their respective feature representation in layer l . We then deﬁne the squared-error loss between the two feature representations including only a smaller number of lower layers, leading to different visual experiences (Fig 3, along the rows). When matching the style representations up to higher layers in the network, local images structures are matched on an increasingly large scale, leading to a smoother and more continuous visual experience. Thus, the visually most appealing images are usually cre- ated by matching the style representation up to the highest layers in the network (Fig 3, last row). Of course, image content and style cannot be completely disentangled. When synthesising an image that combines the content of one image with the style of another, there usually does not exist an image that perfectly matches both constraints at the same time. However, the loss function we minimise during image synthesis contains two terms for content and style respectively, that are well separated (see Methods). We can therefore smoothly regulate the emphasis on either reconstructing the content or the style (Fig 3, along the columns). A strong emphasis on style will result in images that match the appearance of the artwork, effectively giving a texturised version of it, but hardly show any of the photograph’s content (Fig 3, ﬁrst column). When placing strong emphasis on content, one can clearly identify the photograph, but the style of the painting is not as well-matched (Fig 3, last column). For a speciﬁc pair of source images one can adjust the trade-off between content and style to create visually appealing images. Here we present an artiﬁcial neural system that achieves a separation of image content from style, thus allowing to recast the content of one image in the style of any other image. We demonstrate this by creating new, artistic images that combine the style of several well-known paintings with the content of an arbitrarily chosen photograph. In particular, we derive the neural representations for the content and style of an image from the feature responses of high- performing Deep Neural Networks trained on object recognition. To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst demonstration of image features separating content from style in whole natural images. On top of the CNN responses in each layer of the network we built a style representationQuestion: Which loss function is used by authors during image synthesis?","answer":"The loss function consists of 2 separate terms for content representation and artistic style representation. The difference between the content representation of the original image and the reconstructed image is calculated by taking the squared-error loss of the two. While the difference between the stylistic representation of the original artwork and the reconstructed image is calculated by taking the mean-square distance for each layer and combining them by averaging the weighted sum. In the paper, the weights for each style representation of a layer are distributed equally."},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

We asked annotators what they would be interested in generating if there were a T2V system. We filtered out prompts that were incomplete (e.g., “jump into water”), too abstract (e.g., “climate change”), or offensive. We then identified 5 categories (animals, fantasy, people, nature and scenes, food and beverage) and selected prompts for these categories. These prompts were selected without generating any videos for them, and were kept fixed. In addition, we also used the DrawBench prompts from Imagen (Saharia et al., 2022) for human evaluation.We evaluate video quality and text-video faithfulness. For video quality, we show two videos in random order and ask annotators which one is of higher quality. For faithfulness, we additionally show the text and ask annotators which video has a better correspondence with the text (we suggest them to ignore quality issues). In addition, we also conducted human evaluation to compare video motion realism of our interpolation model and FILM (Reda et al., 2022).For each comparison, we use the majority vote from 5 different annotators as the final result.

Determine the answer to the research question based on the context provided. Your answer should be one of: \\"YES\\", \\"NO\\", or \\"MAYBE\\".Context:(AIMS) Hypoglycaemia caused by glucose-lowering therapy has been linked to cardiovascular (CV) events. The ORIGIN trial provides an opportunity to further assess this relationship.(METHODS AND RESULTS) A total of 12 537 participants with dysglycaemia and high CV-risk were randomized to basal insulin glargine titrated to a fasting glucose of ≤ 5.3 mmol/L (95 mg/dL) or standard glycaemic care. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was defined as symptoms confirmed by glucose ≤ 54 mg/dL and severe hypoglycaemia as a requirement for assistance or glucose ≤ 36 mg/dL. Outcomes were: (i) the composite of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke; (ii) mortality; (iii) CV mortality; and (iv) arrhythmic death. Hazards were estimated before and after adjustment for a hypoglycaemia propensity score. During a median of 6.2 years (IQR: 5.8-6.7), non-severe hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in 41.7 and 14.4% glargine and standard group participants, respectively, while severe episodes occurred in 5.7 and 1.8%, respectively. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was not associated with any outcome following adjustment. Conversely, severe hypoglycaemia was associated with a greater risk for the primary outcome (HR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.24-2.02, P<0.001), mortality (HR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.39-2.19, P<0.001), CV death (HR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.27-2.30, P<0.001) and arrhythmic death (HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.17-2.67, P = 0.007). Similar findings were noted for severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia for the primary outcome and mortality. The severe hypoglycaemia hazard for all four outcomes was higher with standard care than with insulin glargine.Question:Does hypoglycaemia increase the risk of cardiovascular events?Answer:","answer":"YES"},{"question":"Develop a data structure to store all Fibonacci numbers up to the 10000th term that is optimized for quick storage, retrieval operations and it should not exceed memory limits.","answer":"Implementing this in Python:We can use a dictionary as our data structure where keys are the indices and values are the Fibonacci numbers. But the Fibonacci number at the 10000th term is very large, around 2089 digits. This number is so huge that it can cause issues with memory as the values before it are not small either.A more optimized way to store all Fibonacci numbers up to the 10000th term without exceeding memory limits and for quick storage and retrieval is to store only the last two Fibonacci numbers at any given point in time. When we need to get the Fibonacci number for a certain index, we keep recalculating the two numbers until we reach the desired index. Here is the python code for that:```pythonclass Fibonacci:    def __init__(self):        self.fib_dict = {0: 0, 1: 1}  # stores the last two Fibonacci numbers    def get(self, n):        if n < 0:            raise Exception(\\"Index was negative. No such thing as a negative index in a series.\\")        elif n >= 2 and n not in self.fib_dict:            self.fib_dict[n] = self.get(n - 1) + self.get(n - 2)        return self.fib_dict[n]fib = Fibonacci()print(fib.get(10000))  # prints the Fibonacci number at the 10000th term```Note that the above method while efficient in memory, will still take a long time to compute the 10000th term. Fibonacci number generation quickly grows in terms of time complexity as the index gets higher. However, due to Python\'s large number handling capabilities, we entrust this to Python and avoid having to implement our own big integer operations.Computing precisely (and fast) such large Fibonacci terms is a well known problem in algorithmics and usually relies on more advanced calculation methods based on \\"Fast Doubling\\" or matrix exponentiation using the \\"Fast exponentiation\\" method for instance."},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper. Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: The results were recorded after 72 hours and the virus tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID 50 ) was calculated using Reed and Muench\'s method [17] . Oligonucleotide RNA. The Triple Helix Forming Oligonucleotides (TFOs) were designed based on the genome sequence of FIPV serotype II strain WSU 79-1146 (Accession no: AY994055) [18] . TFOs, which specifically target the different regions of the FIPV genome, and one unrelated TFO were constructed ( Table 1 ). The specificity of the TFOs was identified using BLAST search in the NCBI database. The designed linear TFOs were synthesized by Dharmacon Research (USA), whereby the 5 and 3 ends of the linear TFOs were modified with phosphate (PO 4 ) group and hydroxide (OH) group, respectively. These modifications were necessary for the circularization of linear TFO. The process of circularization, using the T4 RNA ligase 1 (ssRNA ligase) (New England Biolabs Inc., England), was carried out according to the manufacturer\'s protocol. After ligation, the circular TFO RNAs were recovered by ethanol precipitation and the purity of the circular TFO RNAs was measured using spectrophotometer. Denaturing of urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described before [19] with modification. Briefly, 20% of denatured urea polyacrylamide gel was prepared and polymerized for 30 minutes . Then, the gel was prerun at 20 to 40 V for 45 minutes. Five L of TFO RNA mixed with 5 L of urea loading buffer was heated at 92 ∘ C for 2 minutes and immediately chilled on ice. It was run on the gel at 200 V for 45 minutes. Finally, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide (Sigma, USA) and viewed with a Bio-Rad Gel Doc XR system (CA, USA). (EMSA) . The target regions of the FIPV genome were synthesized by Dharmacon Research (USA) ( Table 1) . Each TFO RNA was mixed with the target region in 1X binding buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, 6 mM MgCl 2 , and 10 mMNaCl in a final volume of 10 L and subsequently incubated at 37 ∘ C for 2 hours. The sample was run on 15% native polyacrylamide gel at 80 V, in cool condition. The stained gel was viewed by a Bio-Rad Gel Doc XR system. Regions. The binding strength was measured using a nano Isothermal Titration Calorimeter (ITC) (TA instruments, Newcastle, UK). The RNA sample mixtures, consisting of circular TFOs (0.0002 mM), were incubated with their respective synthetic target regions (0.015 mM) using 1X binding buffer as the diluent. The experiment was run at 37 ∘ C with 2 L/injection, for a total of 25 injections. Data was collected every 250 seconds and analyzed using the NanoAnalyze software v2.3.6 provided by the manufacturer. This experiment was conducted in CRFK cells, where 3 × 10 4 cell/well was seeded in 96-well plate to reach 80% confluency 24 hours prior to transfection. One hundred nM of TFO RNAs was separately transfected into the CRFK cells using a HiPerFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Germany), as per the manufacturer\'s protocol. The plate was incubated at 37 ∘ C with 5% CO 2 for 6 hours. Then, the cultures were infected with 100TCID 50 of FIPV serotype II strain WSU 79-1146 for 1 hour at 37 ∘ C (100 L/well). Finally, the viral inoculum was replaced by fresh maintenance media (MEM containing 1% FBS and 1% pen/strep). Virus-infected and uninfected cells were maintained as positive and negative controls, respectively. The morphology of the cultures was recorded 72 hours after infection and samples were harvested at this time point and stored at −80 ∘ C prior to RNA extraction. Inhibition. Different concentrations of circular TFO1 RNA (25 nM, 50 nM, 100 nM, and 500 nM) were transfected into CRFK cells. The plate was incubated for 6 hours followed by virus inoculation for 1 hour at 37 ∘ C with 5% CO2. The cells were processed as described above. Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell (ATCC no. CCL-34), at a concentration of 4 × 10 4 cell/well, was seeded in 96-well plate to reach 80% confluency 24 hours prior to transfection. Transfection was performed the same as before. One hundred nM of circular TFO RNA was transfected into MDCK cells. Following 6 hours ORF1a/1b and 530-541ORF1a/1b and 7399-7411ORF1a/1b and 14048-14061- * Highlighted in bold indicated the binding region. * * Unrelated circular TFO. [20, 21] , respectively. The reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed using a Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time system (BioRad, USA). The reaction was amplified in a final volume of 25 L using a SensiMix SYBR No-ROX One-Step Kit (Bioline, UK), which consisted of 12.5 L 2X SensiMix SYBR No-Rox One-Step reaction buffer, 10 M forward and reverse primers, 10 units RiboSafe RNase inhibitor, and 5 L template RNA. Absolute quantification approach was used to quantify qPCR results where a standard curve of a serial dilution of virus was plotted before the quantification. Amount of the virus in the samples was quantified based on this standard curve. Analysis. Data statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 18.0. Data were represented as mean ± SE of three independent tests. One-way ANOVA, Tukey post hoc test was used to analyze the significant level among the data. ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. genome, which play important roles in viral replication, were selected as the target binding sites for the triplex formation. The target regions were 5 untranslated region (5 UTR), Open Reading Frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b, and 3 untranslated region (3 UTR) ( Table 1 ). The TFOs were designed in duplex, as they can bind with the single stranded target region and reshape into triplex. Both ends of the duplex TFOs were ligated with a linker sequence or clamps (C-C) to construct circular TFO RNA. Denaturing PAGE assay was carried out after the ligation process to determine the formation of the circular TFO. As shown in Figure 1 , the circular TFO RNAs migrated faster than the linear TFO RNAs, when subjected to 20% denaturing PAGE. Target Region. The binding ability was determined using Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) [23] . The appearance of the slow mobility band indicates the successful hybridization of circular TFO RNA with its target region. The binding ability of different TFO RNAs (TFO1 to TFO5) against their target regions was determined by EMSA (Figure 2) . TFO1, TFO3, TFO4, and TFO5 showed slow mobility band, while TFO2 showed the lack of an upward shifted band. This indicates the possession of triplex binding ability for all circular TFO RNAs, except TFO2. TFO RNA. Study on the interaction and hybridization of TFO towards its target region is crucial, since the stronger the binding is, the more stable the triplex structure forms. As shown in supplementary Figure 1 (Table 3) . The antiviral effect of circular TFO RNAs was investigated by RT-qPCR assay at 72 hours after transfection. The results showed viral RNA genome copy numbers of 3.65 × 10 9 , 3.22 × 10 14 , 5.04 × 10 9 , 5.01 × 10 9 , 4.41 × 10 9 , and 3.96 × 10 14 in cells treated with TFO1, TFO2, TFO3, TFO4, TFO5, and TFO7, respectively. The data analyzed by one-way ANOVA, Tukey post hoc test showed significant high viral RNA genome copy number of 4.03 × 10 14 for virus inoculated cells as compared to circular TFO1, TFO3, TFO4, and TFO5 treatments ( ≤ 0.05). The viral RNA copies of circular TFO2, linear TFO3 and TFO4, and unrelated circular TFO7 RNAs transfected cells also showed high viral RNA copy numbers which did not show significant differences to the infected cells ( ≥ 0.05) ( Figure 3 ). The morphological changes of the cells were also captured 72 hours after transfection. The cells transfected with circular TFO1, TFO3, TFO4, and TFO5 appeared to be in good condition following virus inoculation, while the cells transfected with circular TFO2 and linear TFO3 and TFO4 showed visible cytopathic effect (CPE), the same as virus inoculated cells (supplementary Figure 2) . Furthermore, cells transfected with TFO only remain viable indicating that TFO treatment is generally not toxic to the cells. Hence, these results illustrated the capacity of circular TFO RNAs (except TFO2) to inhibit FIPV replication. Concentrations on FIPV Replication. Circular TFO1 was used to examine the dose-response relationship as a representative to other TFOs. The experimental conditions were identical to that of the previous experiment, except for TFO1 concentrations of 25 nM, 50 nM, 100 nM, and 500 nM. There was no significant reduction in viral RNA genome copies using the concentration of 25 nM TFO1. The other concentrations caused significant reductions in copy numbers as compared to the virus-infected cells. However, no significant difference was detected in copy numbers from all of these concentrations ( Figure 4 ). The specificity of the TFO towards FIPV was tested, using TFO1 and TFO5, as the proper representatives of TFOs, on influenza A virus H1N1 New Jersey 8/76. The analyzed data using one-way ANOVA, Tukey post hoc test did not show significant reductions in the copies of viral RNA for both TFOs compared to the influenza virus inoculated cells ( ≥ 0.05) (supplementary Figure 3 ). Complex structure G4/Cir4 Figure 2 : EMSA analysis. EMSA analysis illustrated the binding of circular TFO 1, 3, 4, and 5 to the target regions as evidenced by upward band shift. Binding of each circular TFO except circular TFO2 to its respective target forms a complex that migrates slower than unbound TFO. G1 to G5 represent the target region for circular TFO1 to TFO5 and Cir1 to Cir5 represent the circular TFO1 to TFO5, respectively. in the replication process [24] . Meanwhile, the ORF1a/1b of FIPV are translated into polyproteins that are cleaved into nonstructural proteins which assemble into replicationtranscription complexes together with other viral proteins [24] . Hence, the development of molecular therapy targeting these critical regions may provide the possibility to inhibit FIPV replication. Development of antiviral therapies against FIPV using siRNA [25] and viral protease inhibitors [26] Figure 4 : TFO1 dose-response study for inhibiting FIPV replication. The concentrations of 50 nM and higher showed significant antiviral effects. 50 nM of circular TFO1 RNA was able to reduce viral copy number by 5-fold log 10 from 10 14 to 10 9 , while 100 and 500 nM showed 4-fold reduction. Data are averages of 3 independent tests (mean ± SE). * Significantly different from FIPV-infected group. as potential new treatments against FIPV infection. In this study, circular Triple Helix Forming Oligonucleotide (TFO) RNAs, specifically targeting the short regions of viral genome for triplex formation, were designed and evaluated. TFO1 and TFO2 targeted the 5 and 3 UTRs of the viral genome, respectively. TFO3 to TFO5 targeted different regions of the ORF1a/1b on FIPV genome. Prior to in vitro antiviral study, the ligated circular TFOs were evaluated using PAGE analysis. All of the circularised TFO showed faster migration pattern compared to the linear TFO; however, only slight variation was detected for some of the TFO (Figure 1 ). The reason for this is not clear but probably due to the differences in length and the tertiary structures of the TFOs leading to differences in the migration rate. EMSA was used to show the binding capability of each circular TFO towards the target region in the FIPV genome except for TFO2 which showed lack of formation of complex structure upon hybridization ( Figure 2) . The EMSA result also concurred with the antiviral study, where all circular TFOs (except TFO2) were able to demonstrate a significant reduction in the viral RNA genome copy numbers by 5-fold log 10 from 10 14 in virus inoculated cells to 10 9 in TFO-transfected cells (Figure 3 ). However, no antiviral properties were detected from the linear TFOs and unrelated circular TFO7 RNA, confirming that the antiviral activity is associated with specific binding of circular TFOs towards targeted regions. Furthermore, the binding of the circular TFO to the target region was confirmed by nanoITC analysis; where the low value and high stability allowed TFOs to compete effectively with the target regions for inhibiting transcription in cell-free systems. Since, TFO1 shows the lowest value (Table 3) , the antiviral properties of this TFO were evaluated in doseresponse study. As shown in Figure 4 , 50 and 100 nM of TFO1 showed similar antiviral effects indicating the potential therapeutic application of TFO1 on FIPV replication. However, increasing the concentration of TFO1 to 500 nm failed to reduce the viral load further probably due to inefficiency of the transfection reagent to transfect the TFO into the cells. In addition, the virus has fast replication rate upon in vitro infection, where previous study on the growth of FIPV in CRFK cells showed that by 2 hours approximately 67% of FIPV 79-1146 were internalized by CRFK cells by endocytosis increasing to more than 70% at 3 hours [27, 28] . The above finding probably also explained the reason why no antiviral effect was detected when the transfection of the TFO was performed on virus-infected cells (data not shown).Question: For how long was the denatured polyacrylamide gel polymerized?","answer":"30 minutes"},{"question":"Develop a Python function that examines two input strings.

This method is fundamentally used to resolve optimization problems, parsing, and numerous other computational problems. The key idea is to save the solution of each subproblem so that if next time same subproblem occurs, instead of recomputing its solution, one could directly reuse the cached version of the solution. This concept is also known as memoization.The principle behind dynamic programming can be encapsulated via the following steps:- Optimal substructure: Break the problem into subproblems such that the solution to the main problem relies on the solutions to the smaller problems.- Overlapping subproblems: In many conventional recursion algorithms, several computations are unnecessarily executed multiple times as they solve the same subproblem repeatedly. In dynamic programming, instead of solving these subproblems again and again, their results are simply stored.Applications of Dynamic Programming:1. Computer Science: Used extensively in algorithms that can be solved by dividing them into smaller overlapping sub-problems. It helps in improving the time complexity significantly. Examples include Travelling Salesman Problem, Tower of Hanoi, All Pair Shortest Path, etc.2. Economics & Resource Allocation: DP can be applied in decision processes to optimally allocate resources and make decisions that result in an outcome that is best for a company or individual.3. Control Engineering: DP is used in solving multi-stage decision problem in control engineering and operations research.4. Bioinformatics: DP is used for DNA sequencing in bioinformatics to align and compare sequences.5. Mathematics: It is used in many areas in mathematics for exhaustive search, optimization problems and in proving polynomial-time correctness.In terms of space and computational complexities, Dynamic Programming often provides good trade-offs. Although, it\'s noteworthy that the efficiency of Dynamic Programming solely depends upon the nature of the problem. If a problem has many overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure property, then we can solve it using DP. On the other hand, DP can go horribly wrong when these conditions are not met and can lead to solutions that have exponential computations and storage. In conclusion, Dynamic Programming is a robust optimization tool in computer science and other disciplines. It has the power to drastically reduce the time complexity from exponential to polynomial times. However, the trade-off is an increase in space complexity. It\'s not a one-size-fits-all solution. Rather, it\'s a methodology to devise solutions for a class of problems characterized by overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure property."},{"question":"Write a JavaScript Function that takes a string as input, applies the quicksort algorithm on its characters and rotates each letter by 13 positions according to ROT13 cipher, finally returns the rearranged and ciphered string.For example, if the string is \\"hello world\\", the output should be \\"uryyb jbeyq\\".","answer":"Here\'s a JavaScript solution that accomplishes this. First, it defines a helper function to apply ROT13 to a single character. It then defines the main function, that quicksorts the string and then maps each character to its ROT13 equivalent. We encapsulate our quickSort logic inside a function for modularity. Our quickSort function works by selecting a pivot and comparing the other characters to that pivot, then recursively sorting the smaller and larger subsets.The ROT13 cipher moves each letter 13 positions ahead in the alphabet, wrapping around at \'z\'.```javascript// Helper function to cipher a single character with ROT13function ROT13(c) {  let alphabet = \'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\';  let upperAlphabet =\'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\'  if(c.match(/[a-z]/)){      return alphabet[(alphabet.indexOf(c) + 13) % 26];  }else if(c.match(/[A-Z]/)){      return upperAlphabet[(upperAlphabet.indexOf(c) + 13) % 26];  }else{      return c;  }}// Helper function to sortfunction quickSort(s) {  if (s.length <= 1) {    return s;  }  let pivot = s[0];  let less = [];  let greater = [];  for (let i = 1; i < s.length; i++) {    if (s[i] < pivot) {      less.push(s[i]);    } else {      greater.push(s[i]);    }  }  return quickSort(less).concat(pivot, quickSort(greater));}function sortAndCipher(s) {  // Quick sort the string  let sorted = quickSort(s.split(\'\'));  // Cipher each character with ROT13  let ciphered = sorted.map(ROT13);  // Return the final sorted and ciphered string  return ciphered.join(\'\');}let testString = \\"hello world\\";console.log(sortAndCipher(testString));``` Here the \\"sortAndCipher\\" function splits the string into an array of characters, applies the quicksort and map each character to its result of the \\"ROT13\\" function, and finally re-combine the characters into a single string. The console.log line tests the function with \\"hello world\\" and shows the result. The quicksort function is a straightforward implementation of the algorithm. We take the first character of the string as the pivot and partition the remainder into characters less than and greater than the pivot, then recursively sort these two lists. The output of this program will be \\"uryyb jbeyq\\" as expected."},{"question":"Develop a dedicated Microservice, utilizing either Go or Scala, that is exclusively responsible for the acquisition and transformation of data derived from the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), and subsequently integrating this data into a Time-series database.

Moreover, the microservice should have the ability to manage massive data flows and ensure the reliability and accuracy of the preserved data, while concurrently addressing potential latency issues and preventing data duplication. This task necessitates an advanced, multi-leveled prediction process, and the microservice must be designed to traverse these intricacies in a sturdy and efficient manner, with a heightened focus on extensibility and durability.","answer":"Developing the above-stated microservice would involve several development stages as outlined below. Due to the complexity of the task and the detail level at which it is explained, only a high-level overview with source code template will be offered here.Since this microservice entails handling vast data flows and processing them in a secure and efficient way, the Go language is more suitable for this task, providing strong support for concurrent programming and data processing, with minimal memory footprint.Stage 1: CoAP Data AcquisitionA dedicated module needs to be developed for CoAP data acquisition, which may use an established Go library like go-coap for CoAP communication.```gopackage mainimport (\\t\\"log\\"\\t\\"github.com/dustin/go-coap\\")func main() {\\tl, err := net.NewListener(\\"udp\\", \\":5683\\")\\tlog.Fatal(coap.Serve(l, coap.FuncHandler(handler)))}func handler(l *net.UDPConn, a *net.UDPAddr, m *coap.Message) *coap.Message {   // handle the received CoAP data   // and pass it to the next layer}```Stage 2: Data TransformationThe data collected will be, on the second layer, systematically altered and transformed, using Hidden Markov Model for sequence prediction.```gofunc transformData(inputData Data) (outputData Data) {   // implement transformation logic based on HMM here}```Stage 3: Data Integration into a Time-series databaseThe transformed data will then be integrated into a time-series database (using something like InfluxDB).```gofunc saveToDB(outputData Data) {   // connect to the time-series database   // and save the transformed data}```This microservice should be also designed with a flow controller that manages the flow of data through the above modules, managing concurrency and potential latency issues, ensuring reliability and no duplication of data. The design should also be extensible for future needs and robust enough to handle possible failures, with retry logic and on-fail procedures.As a final note, developing such a complex system as a single microservice would take significant time and expertise, particularly for dealing with potential concurrency and latency issues.

They are known since 1962, [1] and a number of recent investigations focussed on both their reactivity and application in organic synthesis, such as nitrogen sources for metal-catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions, [2][3][4][5] and their biological activity, for instance as analogous of oncolytic sulfonylureas [6][7][8] or mimics of intermediates in protease and amidase reactions. [9] Only a few synthetic approaches for their preparation have been reported, the most direct and common route being the nucleophilic substitution of a sulfonimidoyl chloride 2 with an amine (Scheme 1).</p><p>Various chlorinating reagents can be applied for the synthesis of the respective sulfonimidoyl intermediates. Among them, and despite its explosive nature, tert-butyl hypochlorite is the most widely used one. [10][11][12][13] Other chlorinating agents present a rather limited substrate scope. For example, chlorine [14][15][16][17] is preferred for N-alkyl sulfinamides, reacting very violently with N-aryl derivatives. N-chlorobenzotriazole [15,16,18] is less efficient with bulky amines, and with chloramine-T or -N [3,4,19] only N-tosyl or -nosyl sulfonimidamides can be obtained. In addition, an alternative route to the intermediate N-tosyl or -nosyl sulfonimidoyl chlorides involves the reaction of sulfinyl chlorides with chloramine-T or -N.</p><p>In connection with our interest on the application of sulfonimidamides in organic synthesis, [20] we now aimed at exploring an alternative and general procedure for the synthesis of these molecules avoiding the use of potential explosive reagents.</p>Results and discussion<p>For the preliminary screening, N-benzoyl sulfinamide 1a was chosen as the model substrate (Scheme 2).</p><p>Scheme 2: Synthesis of N-benzoyl sulfonimidamides 3a.</p><p>First, the reaction of 1a with different halogenating agents was studied (Table 1).</p><p>Starting point was the use of chloramine-T as the most common chlorinating reagent for such transformation. As hypothesized, the reaction involved the corresponding sulfonimidoyl chloride. Thus, in the reaction of 1a with chloramine-T in acetonitrile both sulfonimidoyl chloride 2a and sulfinamidamide 3a were isolated in 33 and 54% yield, respectively (Table 1, Entry 1). The use of MS 4Å (1 g/mmol) did not improve this result, leading to a similar mixture of 2a and 3a after 20 h (Entry 2). Other solvents such as dichloromethane gave an unsatisfactory 2a:3a ratio of 1:1 (31 and 32% yield, respectively; Entry 3). Moreover, the reaction in toluene gave exclusively 2a in 68% yield after 24 h (Entry 4). Gratifyingly, using a combination of chloramine-T and TsNHNa, the desired sulfonimidamide 3a was obtained selectively and in high yield (91%) in both acetonitrile and THF as solvents (Table 1, Entries 5 and 6). The reaction with the highly reactive t-BuOCl was surprisingly less efficient, leading to 3a in 73% yield after 20 h, along with unreacted sulfonimidoyl chloride 2a (20%, Table 1, Entry 7). Other halogenating agents, such as I 2 , bromamine-T, or NBS, [21] were tested as well (Table 1, Entries 8-10), but they exhibited a significantly lower efficiency than the previous chlorinating agents.</p><p>Since N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) had been applied for the oxidation of 4-(methylthio)morpholine towards the synthesis of diazasulfonium salts [22] and the preparation of dialkylamino succinimidosulfonium salts from sulfenamides, [23] this nonexplosive and easy to handle oxidizing agent was tested next.</p><p>To our delight, 1a and NCS reacted well, and in combination with TsNHNa in acetonitrile sulfonimidamide 3a was obtained in excellent yield (94%, Table 1, Entry 12). Noteworthy, the qualitative formation of sulfonimidoyl chloride 2a and its conversion to sulfonimidamide 3a could easily be followed by TLC.</p><p>Subsequently, the role of the substituent at the sulfinamide nitrogen was examined. The reactivity of N-benzoyl, -benzyl and -tert-butyl carbamate protected sulfinamides 1a-c, which were prepared according to literature procedures from NH 2 -free p-tolylsulfinamide using n-BuLi and the corresponding anhydride [24] or by reaction of p-tolylsulfinyl chloride with BnNH 2 , was compared in the reaction with NCS and TsNHNa in CH 3 CN at room temperature (Table 1, Entries 12-14).</p><p>The best result was obtained with N-benzoyl sulfinamide 1a (94%, Table 1, Entry 12). However, reaction of N-Boc derivative 1c also gave the desired product 3c in good yield (78%, Entry 14). On the other hand, N-benzyl derivative 1b led to 3b in only moderate 56% yield (Entry 13). Therefore, benzoyl was regarded as the N-protecting group of choice for the following studies.</p><p>In order to establish the generality of this method, the reaction of 1a with different amines and amides was next investigated (Table 2).</p><p>p-Nitrobenzenesulfonyl and thiophenesulfonylamide sodium salts (NsNHNa and ThphNHNa) were reacted with 1a in the presence of NCS to yield sulfonimidamides 3 in good yields (86 and 94%, Table 2, Entries 1 and 2, respectively). In contrast, when the bulky tert-butylsulfonylamide sodium salt (BusNHNa) was used (Entry 3), the reaction was less efficient.</p><p>In that case, the desired product 3f was isolated in only moderate yield (50%), together with unreacted sulfonimidoyl chloride 2a (28%), even after prolonged reaction times (24 h). The weakly basic cyanogen amine (pKa ~ 17), which had previously been used in the formation of N-cyano sulfilimines from sulfides using NBS as halogenating agent, [25] was also able to undergo the reaction in the presence of t-BuOK (85%, Table 2, Entry 4). Finally, the more reactive aniline, dimethylamine and hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) were successfully employed. Even in the absence of an additional base the corresponding products were obtained after short reaction time (2-4 h) in 89-97% yield (Table 2, Entries 5-7).</p><p>Ultimately, the cleavage of the N-benzoyl group in 3a was performed (Scheme 3). As expected, the exclusive formation of the most stable regioisomer 4 was observed (73% yield). On the other hand, under the same reaction conditions the attempted deprotection of 3i gave sulfinamide 5 in good yield (87%) as a result of both N-benzoyl cleavage and elimination of the protonated dimethyl amino group.</p><p>In conclusion, we have described a convenient procedure for the synthesis of sulfonimidamides from sulfinamides using a variety of amines and N-chlorosuccinimide as oxidant. The reaction involves sulfonimidoyl chlorides formed in situ, which can be isolated depending on the reaction conditions. The cleavage of the N-benzoyl group has been achieved in the case of N-tosyl derivative 3a. In contrast, the selective deprotection of N-benzoyl sulfonimidamides derived from secondary amine 3i remained unsuccessful due to the concomitant elimination of the substituted amine group under the normal acidic conditions used.</p>Experimental<p>[See Supporting Information File 1]</p>Supporting Information<p>Supporting Information File 1</p>License and Terms<p>This is an Open Access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.</p><p>The license is subject to the Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry terms and conditions: (http://www.beilstein-journals.org/bjoc)</p><p>The definitive version of this article is the electronic one which can be found at: doi:10.1186/1860-5397-3-25</p>","answer":"BackgroundThe synthesis of sulfonimidamides involves the nucleophilic substitution of a sulfonimidoyl chloride with an amine. However, only four chlorinating systems have been reported for the preparation of the sulfonimidoyl chloride intermediates. Whereas some of them have shown a rather limited substrate spectrum, the most versatile and commonly used tert-butyl hypochlorite is known to be explosive. To establish alternative methods for the synthesis of these molecules is therefore desirable. ResultsThe preparation of various p-tolylsulfonimidamides through the reaction of the corresponding N-protected p-tolylsulfinamides and a number of amines in the presence of N-chlorosuccinimide was achieved at room temperature in 50-97% yield.

Below is a rough example of how you could use C with libmysqlclient to connect to a MySQL database and fetch data similar to the Python script above.

I\'d recently heard about a challenge amazon had posted to the world to come up with a better recommendation engine for their system.The winner apparently produced the best algorithm by limiting the amount of information that was being fed to it.As a first rule of thumb I guess... \\"I know\'s it\'s subjective, but ultimately it\'s a measurable thing (clicks in response to recommendations).Since most of us are dealing with the web these days and search can be considered a form of recommendation...  I suspect I\'m not the only one who\'d appreciate other peoples ideas on this. In a nutshell,","answer":"the best approach to building a recommendation engine is finding the right balance between information utilization and overload. Too much information can confuse the algorithm, and too little might not yield accurate results. It all boils down to knowing which data to prioritize and how to effectively process it to deliver the most relevant and accurate recommendations possible.For a start, focusing on implicit data derived from users\' behavior (clicks, time spent on a page, etc.) instead of just relying on explicit feedback (ratings, reviews, etc.) usually yields more accurate results. Secondly, analyzing short-term behavior might be more effective as it can adapt quickly to users\' changing preferences, compared to algorithms that overly rely on long-term historical data. Collaborative filtering techniques (user-based and item-based) are also common practices when building recommendation engines and can be quite effective. User-based collaborative filtering recommends items by finding users who are similar to the targeted user based on their ratings patterns. On the other hand, item-based collaborative filtering calculates the similarities between items from the user-item interactions, and then recommends similar items to what the user has previously interacted with. Both methods have their pros and cons and can be used depending on the context and requirements.Moreover, hybrid models that combine different approaches can also be highly effective. You can mix collaborative filtering with content-based methods or matrix factorization to improve recommendations.Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep Learning techniques are also increasingly being used to enhance recommendation systems. For instance, word embeddings can be utilized to understand the context of words, and this can improve content-based recommendations especially when dealing with text data.Lastly, always iterate and improve upon your model based on the feedback you get from your users. Constant refinement is part of the process of building an effective recommendation engine.

So, when you do `1 << 4` it means you\'re shifting the bits of the number `1` four places to the left. In binary `1` is `0001` (considering only 4 bits), so shifting `1` four places to the left would get you `10000`, which is 16 in decimal.

However, the evidence on the efficacy of the combination for acral or mucosal subtypes remains less robust. This is the final analysis of a multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled phase II study that investigated the long-term efficacy and safety in treatment-naive Japanese patients with advanced melanoma, including acral or mucosal subtypes, and subsequent therapy after discontinuation of the investigational agents. Patients received four doses of nivolumab (1 mg/kg i.v.) in combination with ipilimumab (3 mg/kg i.v.) at 3-week intervals, followed by doses of nivolumab (3 mg/kg i.v.) at 2-week intervals. The median follow-up period was 20.8 months (range, 5.2-35.0). The centrally and locally assessed objective response rates were both 43.3% (13/30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 25.5-62.6). Median progression-free survival was not reached (95% CI, 3.02-not reached), and median overall survival was also not reached (95% CI, 19.52-not reached). The 30-month progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 50.3% and 54.2%, respectively. No new safety concerns were detected. After discontinuation of the investigational agents, 83.3% of patients received some form of subsequent therapy including 43.3% of patients who received nivolumab monotherapy and 26.7% of patients who received radiotherapy. Of the four patients who discontinued the investigational agents because of immune-related adverse events, two received subsequent therapy (nivolumab and ipilimumab, respectively) and the other two showed long-term treatment-free survival (659 and 590 days, respectively). Long-term survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab was observed in Japanese patients with melanoma including acral and mucosal subtypes, which is consistent with the CheckMate 067 study.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  Web personalization has demonstrated to be advantageous for both online customers and vendors. However, its benefits may be severely counter acted by privacy constraints. Personalized systems need to take users\' privacy concerns into account, as well as privacy laws and industry self-regulation that may be in effect. In this paper, we first discuss how these constraints may affect web-based personalized systems. We then explain in what way current approaches to this problem fall short of their aims, specifically regarding the need to tailor privacy to the constraints of each individual user. We present a dynamic privacy-enhancing user modeling framework as a superior alternative, which is based on a software product line architecture. Our system dynamically selects personalization methods during runtime that respect users\' current privacy concerns as well as the privacy laws and regulations that apply to them. 4. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB004):  Research on recommender systems typically focuses on the accuracy of prediction algorithms. Because accuracy only partially constitutes the user experience of a recommender system, this paper proposes a framework that takes a user-centric approach to recommender system evaluation. The framework links objective system aspects to objective user behavior through a series of perceptual and evaluative constructs (called subjective system aspects and experience, respectively). Furthermore, it incorporates the influence of personal and situational characteristics on the user experience. This paper reviews how current literature maps to the framework and identifies several gaps in existing work. Consequently, the framework is validated with four field trials and two controlled experiments and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. The results of these studies show that subjective system aspects and experience variables are invaluable in explaining why and how the user experience of recommender systems comes about. In all studies we observe that perceptions of recommendation quality and/or variety are important mediators in predicting the effects of objective system aspects on the three components of user experience: process (e.g. perceived effort, difficulty), system (e.g. perceived system effectiveness) and outcome (e.g. choice satisfaction). Furthermore, we find that these subjective aspects have strong and sometimes interesting behavioral correlates (e.g. reduced browsing indicates higher system effectiveness). They also show several tradeoffs between system aspects and personal and situational characteristics (e.g. the amount of preference feedback users provide is a tradeoff between perceived system usefulness and privacy concerns). These results, as well as the validated framework itself, provide a platform for future research on the user-centric evaluation of recommender systems.Literature Review:","answer":"The new technologies presented in this article impact privacy in several distinctive ways. Some technologies enable new kinds of information to be collected, other technologies provide new ways to analyze data, and the rest enable the possibility of distributing the personalized content in new ways. To understand the effects of the these new technologies, and to guide the design of privacy enhancing approaches, we construct a simple framework for classifying privacy aspects in personalization. The framework, depicted in Fig.1 , is based on two dimensions: personalization phases and privacy control. The personalization phases are taken from the personalization literature BIB002 BIB003 , and include data collection, user model creation, and adaptation. Each of the three phases impose different challenges on privacy and require different measures to address these challenges. The data collection phase represents Fig. 1 Framework for privacy management in personalization. Each of the vertical categories defines a phase in the personalization process and each of horizontal sub-categories defines a level of privacy intrusiveness privacy risks that originate from new types of data collection and analysis. For example, personalization based on location data introduces new risks that originate from new technologies for tracking location on mobile devices. The user model creation phase represents risks that originate from new technologies for analyzing the data. For example, technologies such as collaborative filtering and machine learning allow new predictions to be inferred from data, posing new privacy risks. Technologies and practices for exchanging data between companies increase those risks as they allow data to be traded and sent beyond the service it was collected in. Finally, risks at the adaptation phase originate form distributing the adapted and personalized content in new ways. For example, in traditional personalization systems, the personalized content was shown only to the user, but as we have demonstrated in the sections above, new personalization technologies distribute content to the user\'s social network or even to the World Wide Web. The second dimension of our framework is privacy control: the amount of perceived and actual control users have over their privacy in the personalization process. Technologies that limit users\' control over their privacy are perceived as more intrusive by users BIB001 . For example, a personalization system that relies on user-provided data for the sake of personalization has the potential of being less intrusive than a system that tracks down the user\'s actions automatically. The framework highlights how technologies that are based on high levels of automation pose extended risks to users\' privacy. It can explain the inherent problems of applications such as Google Buzz, which relies on automatically collected context information (e.g., her social network). The technologies presented in Sect. 3 provide designers with a rich toolbox for avoiding or mitigating privacy risks. In order to efficiently use privacy preserving technologies and to guide the development of new ones, it is important to understand which type privacy risks they can mitigate. In this section, we use the framework presented in the previous section to frame privacy technologies according to the personalization process phases they apply to. The framework, depicted in Fig. 2 , includes two dimensions for categorization: personalization phase and engineering approach. Solution approaches are classified according to their focus on the personalization phases: data collection, user model creation, and adaptation. For example, the Do-Not-Track initiative  limits data collection while the configurable user modeling BIB004 provides users with control over the user model creation. Some approaches impact more than one personalization phase: pseudonymous personalization is applicable to all three personalization phases it collects user data, creates user model and applies adaptation under pseudonyms. The engineering approach categorizes approaches towards engineering personalization systems, based on a framework by  that maps engineering practices for privacy preserving systems. The framework distinguishes between privacy-by-policy, which focuses on the implementation of the notice and choice principles of fair information practices, and privacy-by-architecture, which aspires to create systems that minimizes the collection and processing of identifiable personal data. Privacy technologies that are relevant to the data collection phase prevent services from compiling detailed profiles of individual users by tracking their behavior. Technologies such as client-based personalization provide privacy-by-architecture solutions by preventing services from accessing user information directly. Other technologies, such as Do-Not-Track  and Internet Explorer Tracking Protection Lists (Microsoft 2010), enable a privacy-by-policy solution for users who wish to opt-out of tracking. Technologies that are relevant to the model creation phase allow individual data to be hidden from central services, using technologies such as distributed collaborative filtering, or to be configured by the user using configurable user modeling. However, it is not clear that purely architectural solutions are feasible to mitigate privacy risks in the model creation phase, as models which are based on richer data might have the potential of being more accurate. For example, BIB005 show that in recommender systems, there is a tradeoff between the users\' perceived usefulness of the system and privacy concerns. The adaptation phase pose a new challenge to designers of privacy preserving technologies, as the applications of personalized content go far beyond the traditional application of personalizing the experience for a single user. Currently, the social network\'s privacy settings can be used to limit access to personalized content, but these solutions are partial at best. Specifically, the question of how to control the distribution of the product of the personalization process is still an open question."},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

What might be the potential challenges that could arise during this undertaking and what tactical measures can be adopted to mitigate these potential impediments?","answer":"Google Cloud AutoML Vision is a tool that allows developers to train custom machine learning models to classify and analyze images, without requiring a robust background in machine learning. For creating an advanced image-centric recommendation system, the following factors and steps are typically crucial.1. Data Preparation: This is one of the most important steps. The system needs quality data to train on. You\'ll need many examples of each category you want your system to recognize. Google recommends hundreds of images per category, but more can lead to better results. This data needs to be labeled accurately. Machine learning is \\"garbage in, garbage out\\". If your categories are unclear or your labeling is inaccurate, your system will make poor recommendations.2. Model Training: Once data is ready, it\'s uploaded to Google Cloud Storage. You then create a dataset, import the data, and set parameters for training your model. Google AutoML Vision provides two types of model training: single-label classification or multi-label classification. Choose according to your need.3. Evaluate the Model: Google provides an evaluation score for your model, known as the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). The AutoML Vision interface also provides confusion matrices and other metrics for analyzing performance.4. Deploying the Model: Once you\'re satisfied with your model, its last version can be deployed for making predictions.During this undertaking, many challenges might arise:- Data Quality: Poorly labeled and inaccurate data will harm the performance of your model. The solution is rigorous data cleaning and validation.- Model Selection: The accuracy of your system depends on the quality of the model you choose. Different models are suited to different tasks, and AutoML won\'t necessarily know what\'s best.- Overfitting: The model might learn to recognize specifics of your training data that don\'t generalize well to fresh data. This is mitigated by using diverse and extensive training data and by applying techniques like cross-validation.- Cost: While Google AutoML is powerful, it could be costly to train and deploy a model for large businesses with extensive datasets.- Resource Limitations: Training complex machine learning models usually require high computational power. The infrastructure to support massive storage and computational power might be a challenge too.One tactical measure to mitigate these challenges is to use a suitable blend of Google Cloud tools. For example, BigQuery could be implemented to manage large datasets, and Compute Engine could be deployed to support computational requirements. Having a skilled team is imperative too — experienced ML practitioners can circumvent challenges that may be a pitfall for novice developers. They can better manipulate Google\'s AutoML parameters and employ tricks to enhance model performance."},{"question":"Programmatically generate a string as \\"hello world\\" and exhibit it, with all characters capitalized, using a language you\'re familiar with.","answer":"In Python, it can be accomplished simply like this:```pythontext = \\"hello world\\"text = text.upper()print(text)```In this example, the `upper` function is used to convert all the characters in the string to uppercase.

If they match, the test passes; if not, the test fails, and the failure message \\"Square root calculation is incorrect\\" is displayed. This program uses TestNG\'s data providers feature to handle multiple test cases in a clean, efficient way.

Initial Dataset: [7, 19, 5, 4, 16]","answer":"This problem is basically asking to sort an array of integers in increasing order. A simple algorithm is to use Bubble Sort or Insertion sort. However, built-in sorting algorithms in most of the programming languages work faster than the mentioned sorts. Below implementations are in Python and Javascript.Here\'s a Python solution:```pythondef sort_array(array):    return sorted(array)# Initial datasetarray = [7, 19, 5, 4, 16]print(sort_array(array))```And here\'s a JavaScript solution:```javascriptfunction sort_array(array) {    return array.sort((a, b) => a - b);}// Initial datasetvar array = [7, 19, 5, 4, 16];console.log(sort_array(array));```Both of these solutions use the built-in sort function in the respective languages to sort the input array in ascending (i.e., increasing) order. For Python, the sorted() function returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence.For JavaScript, the sort() method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the array. The default sort order is built upon converting the elements into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code unit values. The compare function ((a, b) => a - b) is used to sort numerically and ascending."},{"question":"Design a JavaScript function that checks if every individual integer within a provided multidimensional array is a prime number or not. Also, the function should flatten the multidimensional array before performing the prime check.","answer":"First let\'s create a helper function to check if a number is a prime. ```javascriptfunction isPrime(num){  if (num <= 1)    return false;  else if(num == 2)    return true;  else{    for(var i = 2; i < num; i++)      if(num % i === 0)        return false;    return true;  }}```Now let\'s create a function that can flatten an array of arbitrary depth. ```javascriptfunction flattenArray(arr){    return arr.reduce((flat, toFlatten) => {        return flat.concat(Array.isArray(toFlatten) ? flattenArray(toFlatten) : toFlatten);    }, []);}```Finally, our function that checks if every individual integer within a provided multidimensional array is a prime number or not:```javascriptfunction areAllElementsPrime(arr) {  const flattenedArray = flattenArray(arr);    // Check if each number in the array is prime.  return flattenedArray.every(isPrime);}```This function flattens the multidimensional array and then uses the \'every\' function to test if every array element matches the condition specified by the \'isPrime\' function.If all numbers in the array are prime, the function returns true. If it encounters even one number that is not prime, it will return false. You can use the function like this:```javascriptconsole.log(areAllElementsPrime([[2, 3, 5], 7, 11, [13, [[17]], 19, 23]])); //Output: trueconsole.log(areAllElementsPrime([[4, 6, 8], 10, 12, [14, [[16]], 18, 23]])); //Output: false```"},{"question":"Background:Question:NOTICERole: You are a professional engineer; the main goal is to write PEP8 compliant, elegant, modular, easy to read and maintain Python 3.9 code (but you can also use other programming language)ATTENTION: Use \'##\' to SPLIT SECTIONS, not \'#\'.

The paper submission and review pages should be simple and easy to navigate.## Anything UNCLEARThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approachTo implement this academic paper submission and review system, we will use Django, a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Django is open-source and has a large and active community, which means that it has many third-party packages that can be used to add functionality to our project.For user registration and profile management, we will use Django\'s built-in User model and authentication system. For paper submission and peer review, we will create custom models and views. We will use Django\'s ORM for database operations.For the frontend, we will use Bootstrap, a free and open-source CSS framework, to ensure that our website is responsive and user-friendly. We will also use jQuery, a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library, to add interactivity to our website.To implement the search and filter function, we will use Django\'s Q objects for complex queries and the django-filter third-party package for filtering.## Python package name```python\\"academic_paper_platform\\"```## File list```python[    \\"manage.py\\",    \\"academic_paper_platform/settings.py\\",    \\"academic_paper_platform/urls.py\\",    \\"academic_paper_platform/wsgi.py\\",    \\"users/models.py\\",    \\"users/views.py\\",    \\"users/urls.py\\",    \\"papers/models.py\\",    \\"papers/views.py\\",    \\"papers/urls.py\\",    \\"reviews/models.py\\",    \\"reviews/views.py\\",    \\"reviews/urls.py\\",    \\"templates/base.html\\",    \\"templates/home.html\\",    \\"templates/user_profile.html\\",    \\"templates/paper_submission.html\\",    \\"templates/review_submission.html\\",    \\"static/css/main.css\\",    \\"static/js/main.js\\"]```## Data structures and interface definitions```mermaidclassDiagram    class User{        +str username        +str email        +str password        +str first_name        +str last_name        +date date_joined        +bool is_active        +bool is_staff        +bool is_superuser        --init__(username: str, email: str, password: str, first_name: str, last_name: str)    }    class Paper{        +int id        +str title        +str abstract        +str keywords        +date submission_date        +User author        --init__(title: str, abstract: str, keywords: str, author: User)    }    class Review{        +int id        +str content        +date submission_date        +User reviewer        +Paper paper        --init__(content: str, reviewer: User, paper: Paper)    }    User \\"1\\" -- \\"*\\" Paper: submits    User \\"1\\" -- \\"*\\" Review: writes    Paper \\"1\\" -- \\"*\\" Review: receives```## Program call flow```mermaidsequenceDiagram    participant U as User    participant P as Paper    participant R as Review    U->>P: submit_paper(title, abstract, keywords)    P->>U: confirm_submission()    U->>R: write_review(content, paper)    R->>U: confirm_submission()    U->>P: search_papers(keywords)    P->>U: return_results()```## Anything UNCLEARThe requirement is clear to me., Project Manager: ##

Additionally, optimize the code for better space and time complexity.x = a + by = a + cz = b + d","answer":"Firstly note that your provided source code isn\'t complex enough to really need optimizing for better space and time complexity. The operations of summing up vars take constant time and space in computer programming, but for the sake of learning, let\'s implement this transformation and optimization process. Here is the original code in Python:```pythondef calculate_variables(a, b, c, d):    x = a + b    y = a + c    z = b + d    return x, y, z```Let\'s optimize this with source-to-source transformation. One optimization we can make here is to eliminate the extra storage of the results in variables `x`, `y` and `z` before returning them. This saves a bit of space:```pythondef calculate_variables_optimized(a, b, c, d):    return a + b, a + c, b + d```This version of the function directly computes and returns the results, which is slightly more efficient in terms of memory.Please note both space and time complexity for both programs are O(1), i.e., they are constant. This means they don\'t change based on the input size. Nevertheless, this serves as a good basic example for how to think about optimizing code.Additionally, in real-world cases, code optimization will depend heavily on the specific logic and requirements of your code.

It should provide users with relevant and engaging content, and allow advertisers to target their ads effectively. The platform should also be easy to navigate and offer tracking features for ad performance.## Requirement Pool```python[    (\\"Develop a content recommendation algorithm based on user interests\\", \\"P0\\"),    (\\"Build a user-friendly interface for easy navigation\\", \\"P0\\"),    (\\"Create a native advertising system for targeted ads\\", \\"P0\\"),    (\\"Implement ad performance tracking features\\", \\"P1\\"),    (\\"Ensure the platform supports high-quality content\\", \\"P2\\")]```## UI Design draftThe platform should have a clean and intuitive design. The homepage should feature a feed of recommended content based on the user\'s interests. There should be clear sections for different categories of content. For advertisers, there should be a separate dashboard where they can create, manage, and track their ads.## Anything UNCLEARThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approachThe system will be designed as a web application using Django, a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. For the content recommendation algorithm, we will use Scikit-learn, a machine learning library in Python. It will be used to analyze user interests and provide relevant content. For the native advertising system, we will use Pandas for data manipulation and analysis. For the user interface, we will use Bootstrap, a free and open-source CSS framework. For database, we will use PostgreSQL, a powerful, open source object-relational database system. ## Python package name```python\\"content_discovery_platform\\"```## File list```python[    \\"manage.py\\",    \\"content_discovery_platform/settings.py\\",    \\"content_discovery_platform/urls.py\\",    \\"content_discovery_platform/wsgi.py\\",    \\"users/models.py\\",    \\"users/views.py\\",    \\"users/urls.py\\",    \\"content/models.py\\",    \\"content/views.py\\",    \\"content/urls.py\\",    \\"ads/models.py\\",    \\"ads/views.py\\",    \\"ads/urls.py\\",]```## Data structures and interface definitions```mermaidclassDiagram    class User{        +str username        +str email        +str password        +list interests        +__init__(username: str, email: str, password: str, interests: list)    }    class Content{        +str title        +str description        +list category        +User creator        +__init__(title: str, description: str, category: list, creator: User)    }    class Ad{        +str title        +str description        +list target_audience        +User advertiser        +__init__(title: str, description: str, target_audience: list, advertiser: User)    }    User \\"1\\" -- \\"*\\" Content: creates    User \\"1\\" -- \\"*\\" Ad: creates```## Program call flow```mermaidsequenceDiagram    participant U as User    participant C as Content    participant A as Ad    U->>C: create content    C->>U: return content id    U->>A: create ad    A->>U: return ad id    U->>C: view content    C->>U: return content    U->>A: view ad    A->>U: return ad```## Anything UNCLEARThe requirement is clear to me., Project Manager: ## Required Python third-party packages```python\\"\\"\\"Django==3.2.7Scikit-learn==0.24.2Pandas==1.3.2Bootstrap==5.1.1psycopg2==2.9.1\\"\\"\\"```## Required Other language third-party packages```python\\"\\"\\"No third-party packages required in other languages.\\"\\"\\"```## Full API spec```python\\"\\"\\"openapi: 3.0.0info:  title: Content Discovery Platform API  version: 1.0.0paths:  /users:    post:      summary: Create a new user      requestBody:        required: true        content:          application/json:            schema:              ref: \'#/components/schemas/User\'      responses:        \'200\':          description: User created          content:            application/json:              schema:                ref: \'#/components/schemas/User\'  /content:    post:      summary: Create new content      requestBody:        required: true        content:          application/json:            schema:              ref: \'#/components/schemas/Content\'      responses:        \'200\':          description: Content created          content:            application/json:              schema:                ref: \'#/components/schemas/Content\'  /ads:    post:      summary: Create new ad      requestBody:        required: true        content:          application/json:            schema:              ref: \'#/components/schemas/Ad\'      responses:        \'200\':          description: Ad created          content:            application/json:              schema:                ref: \'#/components/schemas/Ad\'\\"\\"\\"```## Logic Analysis```python[    (\\"manage.py\\", \\"Contains the main entry point for Django project.\\"),    (\\"content_discovery_platform/settings.py\\", \\"Contains all the settings for the Django project.\\"),    (\\"content_discovery_platform/urls.py\\", \\"Defines the site url-to-view mappings.\\"),    (\\"content_discovery_platform/wsgi.py\\", \\"Defines the WSGI application used by Django\'s runserver.\\"),    (\\"users/models.py\\", \\"Defines the User model.\\"),    (\\"users/views.py\\", \\"Defines the views for the User model.\\"),    (\\"users/urls.py\\", \\"Defines the url-to-view mappings for the User model.\\"),    (\\"content/models.py\\", \\"Defines the Content model.\\"),    (\\"content/views.py\\", \\"Defines the views for the Content model.\\"),    (\\"content/urls.py\\", \\"Defines the url-to-view mappings for the Content model.\\"),    (\\"ads/models.py\\", \\"Defines the Ad model.\\"),    (\\"ads/views.py\\", \\"Defines the views for the Ad model.\\"),    (\\"ads/urls.py\\", \\"Defines the url-to-view mappings for the Ad model.\\"),]```## Task list```python[    \\"manage.py\\",    \\"content_discovery_platform/settings.py\\",    \\"content_discovery_platform/urls.py\\",    \\"content_discovery_platform/wsgi.py\\",    \\"users/models.py\\",    \\"users/views.py\\",    \\"users/urls.py\\",    \\"content/models.py\\",    \\"content/views.py\\",    \\"content/urls.py\\",    \\"ads/models.py\\",    \\"ads/views.py\\",    \\"ads/urls.py\\",]```## Shared Knowledge```python\\"\\"\\"\'content_discovery_platform/settings.py\' contains all the settings for the Django project.

We consider both the well known functions of neutrophils (degranulation, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)) and the recently shown one (presentation of an antigene). The special attention is focused on the ambiguity of the neutrophil role in oncogenesis. The dominant view is that neutrophils display exclusively antitumor properties. The update information testifies about protumoral activity of neutrophils: they migrate to a tumor and promote angiogenesis and metastasis at late stages of the tumor. It is interesting that certain components of neutrophil cytotoxic arsenal (ROS, cytokines, specific enzymes) participate both in antitumoral defenses of an organism and protumoral activity.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalEntity\\": [\\"neutrophils\\", \\"tumor\\", \\"polymorphonuclear granulocytes\\", \\"neutrophil\\", \\"tumoral\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown sections from a scientific research paper, together with a question about the paper.

Context accompanying a hate speech text is useful for identifying hate speech, which however has been largely overlooked in existing datasets and hate speech detection models. In this paper, we provide an annotated corpus of hate speech with context information well kept. Then we propose two types of hate speech detection models that incorporate context information, a logistic regression model with context features and a neural network model with learning components for context. Our evaluation shows that both models outperform a strong baseline by around 3% to 4% in F1 score and combining these two models further improve the performance by another 7% in F1 score.IntroductionFollowing a turbulent election season, 2016\'s cyber world is awash with hate speech. Automatic detection of hate speech has become an urgent need since human supervision is unable to deal with large quantities of emerging texts.Context information, by our definition, is the text, symbols or any other kind of information related to the original text. While intuitively, context accompanying hate speech is useful for detecting hate speech, context information of hate speech has been overlooked in existing datasets and automatic detection models.Online hate speech tends to be subtle and creative, which makes context especially important for automatic hate speech detection. For instance,(1) barryswallows: Merkel would never say NOThis comment is posted for the News titled by \\"German lawmakers approve \'no means no\' rape law after Cologne assaults\\". With context, it becomes clear that this comment is a vicious insult towards female politician. However, almost all the publicly available hate speech annotated datasets do not contain context information. BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 .We have created a new dataset consisting of 1528 Fox News user comments, which were taken from 10 complete discussion threads for 10 widely read Fox News articles. It is different from previous datasets from the following two perspectives. First, it preserves rich context information for each comment, including its user screen name, all comments in the same thread and the news article the comment is written for. Second, there is no biased data selection and all comments in each news comment thread were annotated.In this paper, we explored two types of models, feature-based logistic regression models and neural network models, in order to incorporate context information in automatic hate speech detection. First, logistic regression models have been used in several prior hate speech detection studies BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 , BIBREF0 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF9 and various features have been tried including character-level and word-level n-gram features, syntactic features, linguistic features, and comment embedding features. However, all the features were derived from the to-be-classified text itself. In contrast, we experiment with logistic regression models using features extracted from context text as well. Second, neural network models BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 have the potential to capture compositional meanings of text, but they have not been well explored for online hate speech detection until recently BIBREF13 . We experiment with neural net models containing separate learning components that model compositional meanings of context information. Furthermore, recognizing unique strengths of each type of models, we build ensemble models of the two types of models. Evaluation shows that context-aware logistic regression models and neural net models outperform their counterparts that are blind with context information. Especially, the final ensemble models outperform a strong baseline system by around 10% in F1-score.Related WorksRecently, a few datasets with human labeled hate speech have been created, however, most of existing datasets do not contain context information. Due to the sparsity of hate speech in everyday posts, researchers tend to sample candidates from bootstrapping instead of random sampling, in order to increase the chance of seeing hate speech. Therefore, the collected data instances are likely to be from distinct contexts.For instance, in the Primary Data Set described in BIBREF14 and later used by BIBREF9 , 10% of the dataset is randomly selected while the remaining consists of comments tagged by users and editors. BIBREF15 built a balanced data set of 24.5k tweets by selecting from Twitter accounts that claimed to be racist or were deemed racist using their followed news sources. BIBREF5 collected hateful tweets related to the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby in 2013. BIBREF0 provided a corpus of 16k annotated tweets in which 3.3k are labeled as sexist and 1.9k are labeled as racist. They created this corpus by bootstrapping from certain key words ,specific hashtags and certain prolific users. BIBREF16 created a dataset of 9000 human labeled paragraphs that were collected using regular expression matching in order to find hate speech targeting Judaism and Israel. BIBREF7 extracted data instances from instagram that were associated with certain user accounts. BIBREF2 presented a very large corpus containing over 115k Wikipedia comments that include around 37k randomly sampled comments and the remaining 78k comments were selected from Wikipedia blocked comments.Most of existing hate speech detection models are feature-based and use features derived from the target text itself. BIBREF5 experimented with different classification methods including Bayesian Logistic Regression, Random Forest Decision Trees and SVMs, using features such as n-grams, reduced n-grams, dependency paths, and hateful terms. BIBREF0 proposed a logistic regression model using character n-gram features. BIBREF14 used the paragraph2vec for joint modeling of comments and words, then the generated embeddings were used as feature in a logistic regression model. BIBREF9 experimented with various syntactic, linguistic and distributional semantic features including word length, sentence length, part of speech tags, and embedding features, in order to improve performance of logistic regression classifiers. Recently, BIBREF17 surveyed current approaches for hate speech detection, which interestingly also called to attention on modeling context information for resolving difficult hate speech instances.Annotation GuidelinesOur annotation guidelines are similar to the guidelines used by BIBREF9 . We define hateful speech to be the language which explicitly or implicitly threatens or demeans a person or a group based upon a facet of their identity such as gender, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. The labeling of hateful speech in our corpus is binary. A comment will be labeled as hateful or non-hateful.Logistic Regression ModelsIn logistic regression models, we extract four types of features, word-level and character-level n-gram features as well as two types of lexicon derived features. We extract these four types of features from the target comment first. Then we extract these features from two sources of context texts, specifically the title of the news article that the comment was posted for and the screen name of the user who posted the comment.For logistic regression model implementation, we use l2 loss. We adopt the balanced class weight as described in Scikit learn. Logistic regression model with character-level n-gram features is presented as a strong baseline for comparison since it was shown very effective. BIBREF0 , BIBREF9 For character level n-grams, we extract character level bigrams, tri-grams and four-grams. For word level n-grams, we extract unigrams and bigrams.Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, also called LIWC, has been proven useful for text analysis and classification BIBREF19 . In the LIWC dictionary, each word is labeled with several semantic labels. In our experiment, we use the LIWC 2015 dictionary which contain 125 semantic categories. Each word is converted into a 125 dimension LIWC vector, one dimension per semantic category. The LIWC feature vector for a comment or its context is a 125 dimension vector as well, which is the sum of all its words\' LIWC vectors.NRC emotion lexicon contains a list of English words that were labeled with eight basic emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and sentiment polarities (negative and positive) BIBREF20 . We use NRC emotion lexicon to capture emotion clues in text. Each word is converted into a 10 dimension emotion vector, corresponding to eight emotion types and two polarity labels. The emotion vector for a comment or its context is a 10 dimension vector as well, which is the sum of all its words\' emotion vectors.As shown in table TABREF20 , given comment as the only input content, the combination of character n-grams, word n-grams, LIWC feature and NRC feature achieves the best performance. It shows that in addition to character level features, adding more features can improve hate speech detection performance. However, the improvement is limited. Compared with baseline model, the F1 score only improves 1.3%.In contrast, when context information was taken into account, the performance greatly improved. Specifically, after incorporating features extracted from the news title and username, the model performance was improved by around 4% in both F1 score and AUC score. This shows that using additional context based features in logistic regression models is useful for hate speech detection.Neural Network ModelsOur neural network model mainly consists of three parallel LSTM BIBREF21 layers. It has three different inputs, including the target comment, its news title and its username. Comment and news title are encoded into a sequence of word embeddings. We use pre-trained word embeddings in word2vec. Username is encoded into a sequence of characters. We use one-hot encoding of characters.Comment is sent into a bi-directional LSTM with attention mechanism. BIBREF22 . News title and username are sent into a bi-directional LSTM. Note that we did not apply attention mechanism to the neural network models for username and news title because both types of context are relatively short and attention mechanism tends to be useful when text input is long. The three LSTM output layers are concatenated, then connected to a sigmoid layer, which outputs predictions.The number of hidden units in each LSTM used in our model is set to be 100. The recurrent dropout rate of LSTMs is set to 0.2. In addition, we use binary cross entropy as the loss function and a batch size of 128. The neural network models are trained for 30 epochs.As shown in table TABREF21 , given comment as the only input content, the bi-directional LSTM model with attention mechanism achieves the best performance. Note that the attention mechanism significantly improves the hate speech detection performance of the bi-directional LSTM model. We hypothesize that this is because hate indicator phrases are often concentrated in a small region of a comment, which is especially the case for long comments.Ensemble ModelsTo study the difference of logistic regression model and neural network model and potentially get performance improvement, we will build and evaluate ensemble models.As shown in table TABREF24 , both ensemble models significantly improved hate speech detection performance. Figure FIGREF28 shows the system prediction results of comments that were labeled as hateful in the dataset. It can be seen that the two models perform differently. We further examined predicted comments and find that both types of models have unique strengths in identifying certain types of hateful comments.The feature-based logistic regression models are capable of making good use of character-level n-gram features, which are powerful in identifying hateful comments that contains OOV words, capitalized words or misspelled words. We provide two examples from the hateful comments that were only labeled by the logistic regression model:(7)kmawhmf:FBLM.Here FBLM means fuck Black Lives Matter. This hateful comment contains only character information which can exactly be made use of by our logistic regression model.(8)SFgunrmn: what a efen loon, but most femanazis are.This comment deliberately misspelled feminazi for femanazis, which is a derogatory term for feminists. It shows that logistic regression model is capable in dealing with misspelling.The LSTM with attention mechanism are suitable for identifying specific small regions indicating hatefulness in long comments. In addition, the neural net models are powerful in capturing implicit hateful language as well. The following are two hateful comment examples that were only identified by the neural net model:(9)freedomscout: @LarJass Many religions are poisonous to logic and truth, that much is true...and human beings still remain fallen human beings even they are Redeemed by the Sacrifice of Jesus Christ. So there\'s that. But the fallacies of thinking cannot be limited or attributed to religion but to error inherent in human motivation, the motivation to utter self-centeredness as fallen sinful human beings. Nearly all of the world\'s many religions are expressions of that utter sinful nature...Christianity and Judaism being the sole exceptions.This comment is expressing the stereotyping against religions which are not Christian or Judaism. The hatefulness is concentrated within the two bolded segments.(10)mamahattheridge: blacks Love being victims.In this comment, the four words themselves are not hateful at all. But when combined together, it is clearly hateful against black people.Experimental ResultsTable TABREF20 shows the performance of logistic regression models. The first section of table TABREF20 shows the performance of logistic regression models using features extracted from a target comment only. The result shows that the logistic regression model was improved in every metric after adding both word-level n-gram features and lexicon derived features. However, the improvements are moderate.The second section shows the performance of logistic regression models using the four types of features extracted from both a target comment and its contextsThe result shows that the logistic regression model using features extracted from a comment and both types of context achieved the best performance and obtained improvements of 2.8% and 2.5% in AUC score and F1-score respectively.Table TABREF21 shows the performance of neural network models. The first section of table TABREF21 shows the performance of several neural network models that use comments as the only input. The model names are self-explanatory. We can see that the attention mechanism coupled with the bi-directional LSTM neural net greatly improved the online hate speech detection, by 5.7% in AUC score.The second section of table TABREF21 shows performance of the best neural net model (bi-directional LSTM with attention) after adding additional learning components that take context as input. The results show that adding username and news title can both improve model performance. Using news title gives the best F1 score while using both news title and username gives the best AUC score.Table TABREF24 shows performance of ensemble models by combining prediction results of the best context-aware logistic regression model and the best context-aware neural network model. We used two strategies in combining prediction results of two types of models. Specifically, the Max Score Ensemble model made the final decisions based on the maximum of two scores assigned by the two separate models; instead, the Average Score Ensemble model used the average score to make final decisions.We can see that both ensemble models further improved hate speech detection performance compared with using one model only and achieved the best classification performance. Compared with the logistic regression baseline, the Max Score Ensemble model improved the recall by more than 20% with a comparable precision and improved the F1 score by around 10%, in addition, the Average Score Ensemble model improved the AUC score by around 7%.Table 1: Performance of Logistic Regression ModelsFigure 1: System Prediction Results of Comments that were Annotated as HatefulQuestion: How do they combine the models?","answer":"{\\"answer\\": [\\"maximum of two scores assigned by the two separate models\\", \\"average score\\"], \\"evidence\\": [\\"Table TABREF24 shows performance of ensemble models by combining prediction results of the best context-aware logistic regression model and the best context-aware neural network model.

In other words, it allows the program to perform different actions depending on whether a particular condition is true or not.The else clause plays a crucial role in handling scenarios not covered by the if condition, as it ensures that a certain piece of code is executed when the main condition is not met. This provides additional flexibility and control flow in the program, allowing us to handle multiple scenarios without having to write multiple nested if statements or separate if statements for each possible scenario.Here\'s an example to illustrate the concept:```user_age = int(input(\\"Enter your age: \\"))if user_age >= 18:    print(\\"You are eligible to vote.\\")else:    print(\\"You are not eligible to vote.\\")```In this example, if the user\'s age is greater than or equal to 18, the first block of code inside the if statement is executed, and the message \\"You are eligible to vote.\\" is displayed. However, if the user\'s age is less than 18, the else clause is executed, and the message \\"You are not eligible to vote.\\" is displayed.

The reusable controls are styled using CSS which can be placed in its own common library for further reusability. Here\'s a way to do it:1. Open Visual Studio and create a new Class Library named UserControlLibrary. Or, if you prefer, you can create a Web Application project. The project type really depends on what the ASCX controls depend on.2. Delete the automatically created class file and instead, create a new Web User Control.3. Add as many ASCX controls as you want in this project. These controls can then be shared across other applications.4. In each of the ASCX controls, click on the Source View and place an Inherits attribute in the Control directive referencing the fully qualified name of the class in the code-behind.5. Each web application will then reference the UserControlLibrary. Then, it will register each control at the Page, Application(Level in Web.config) or Control level using the Register directive.6. For sharing with SVN, you can check in the UserControlLibrary project into your repository. The other applications that need to reference this project can just check it out. This is the instance where you have to maintain synchronization of this application across multiple projects.Do note that User Controls do not create a DLL when compiled and must live in the application directory structure for referencing. Despite this, code-behind does compile to a DLL and the control directive needs a proper reference in the Inherits attribute to function, and this is where a compiled DLL from a separate project becomes useful.Also, be aware that once you put an ASCX into a DLL, you can no longer use the designer to edit them, since the DLL has to be built and the project referencing the DLL needs to be rebuilt as well."},{"question":"Can anyone tell me why im getting duplicated values when I print the results of this list?degrees_values = [0, 5.85, -2.5]kelvin_values = []for degrees in degrees_values:    kelvin = degrees + 273.15    kelvin_values = kelvin_values + [kelvin]    print(kelvin_values)I\'ve tried printing the list length, just \'kelvin\' but this isn\'t the result I\'m after.

This means that it is impossible for you to change the connection string at runtime, and have the package configuration use that new string.Here are a few solutions to your problem:1. Use indirect configurations: Instead of storing the connection string directly in the package configuration, use an environment variable or a registry entry. This way, you can change the connection string without needing to change the package.2. Use dynamic SQL: Instead of using a connection manager to connect to your database, you can create an Execute SQL task that builds the connection string at runtime and connects to the database using that.3. Use a script task: You can use a script task to modify the connection string of the connection manager at runtime. Then, in your package configuration, use the connection manager\'s connection string property.In your case, the best solution would be to use indirect configurations. You can set the connection string on the test server, and the package will use that string when it runs.Alternatively, you should be able to setup a package configuration option to use XML configuration file and select the option to export all package configurations. When deploying to the another server, you would only need to modify the xml config file with the different settings specific to the test environment.Before running the package, update the value of this variable in the xml configuration file and the package will pick up the new value at runtime.

ReactomeGSA greatly reduces the technical barrier for multi-omics, cross-species, comparative pathway analyses. ReactomeGSA is a new pathway analysis tool integrated into the Reactome ecosystem. Its main feature is that it performs quantitative pathway analyses (so-called gene set analyses). This increases the statistical power of the differential expression analysis, which is directly performed on the pathway level. ReactiveomeGSA is a novel resource for comparative pathway analyses of multi-omics datasets."},{"question":"Develop a HTML/CSS code to implement responsive design that also incorporates CSS animations or transitions, and JavaScript to handle user interactions. The responsive design should work across various devices of differing screen sizes. Set up media queries to manage different layout rules for different device properties.

Maintain the thresholds for changes in design and explain why you chose those specific breakpoints.","answer":"To address this problem, we\'ll build a simple responsive website with a navigation bar that changes when viewed on smaller viewports (mobile devices).HTML structure (index.html):```html<!DOCTYPE html><html>  <head>    <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"styles.css\\">    <script src=\\"app.js\\"><\/script>    <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\\">  </head>  <body>    <nav id=\\"navbar\\">      <ul>        <li><a href=\\"#home\\">Home</a></li>        <li><a href=\\"#about\\">About</a></li>        <li><a href=\\"#contact\\">Contact</a></li>      </ul>    </nav>  </body></html>```CSS styling (styles.css):```css/* Styles for all devices */* {  box-sizing: border-box;}body {  margin: 0;  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;}#navbar ul {  list-style-type: none;  margin: 0;  padding: 0;  overflow: hidden;  background-color: #333;  display: flex;  justify-content: space-around;}#navbar ul li a {  display: block;  color: white;  text-align: center;  padding: 14px 16px;  text-decoration: none;}#navbar ul li a:hover {  background-color: #111;}/* Styles for screens less than 600px wide */@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {  #navbar ul {    flex-direction: column;  }}```JavaScript for user interaction (app.js):```JavaScript// When a link in the navbar is clicked, display an alertdocument.getElementById(\'navbar\').addEventListener(\'click\', function(e) {  if (e.target.tagName === \'A\') {    alert(\'You clicked \' + e.target.innerText);  }});```This is a very simple example and does a few things:-Defines a navigation bar with three links (Home, About, Contact).-Styles the navigation bar, making it responsive with flexbox. By default, the links are spread evenly across the width of the screen. -Defines a CSS media query to handle screens that are 600px wide or less. When the viewport is smaller than 600px, the flexbox changes direction to stack the links vertically. -Incorporates JavaScript to handle user interactions. In this case, when the user clicks a link in the navigation bar, an alert pops up displaying which link was clicked.This solution should work across all modern browsers. The breakpoint at 600px was selected arbitrarily for this example, and might not be ideal for all applications.

Is it a) the interval is invalidated due to the impossibility of negative probabilities b) the interval\'s validity is undermined as it does not encompass zero c) Subaru owners are approximately 19.7% more satisfied with the drive systems compared to Toyota owners or d) There is a 90% confidence level indicating a difference in proportions between Toyota and Subaru car owners\' satisfaction within a range of -0.278 to -0.116?","answer":"The 90% confidence interval of the difference between the proportion of satisfied Toyota and Subaru car owners concerning their vehicles\' drive systems ranges from -0.278 to -0.116. This interval estimate signifies that we are 90% confident that the true difference in proportions falls within this range. This fact indicates that Subaru owners are more satisfied with their vehicles\' drive systems than Toyota owners. Given that the confidence interval estimate does not encompass zero, it suggests a statistically significant difference between the two proportions. That is, we can rule out the possibility that there is no difference in the satisfaction levels of Toyota and Subaru car owners with their car drive systems as far as the given confidence interval is concerned.Thus option d) is the appropriate conclusion. There is a 90% confidence level indicating a difference in proportions between Toyota and Subaru car owners\' satisfaction within a range of -0.278 to -0.116.Here\'s a Python code snippet that can be used to confirm this:```pythonimport statsmodels.api as smimport numpy as np# sample sizesn_toyota = 112n_subaru = 81# number of satisfied customerssatisfied_toyota = 83satisfied_subaru = 76# proportionsprop_toyota = satisfied_toyota/n_toyotaprop_subaru = satisfied_subaru/n_subaru# Confidence levelconfidence_level = 0.90# Computing the confidence intervalproportion_diff = prop_subaru - prop_toyotaz_score = sm.stats.proportion_confint(np.abs(proportion_diff), alpha=(1-confidence_level), method=\'normal\')confidence_interval = [proportion_diff - x for x in z_score]print(\\"Confidence interval: \\", confidence_interval)```This Python code calculates the confidence interval for the difference in proportions.

Could you guide me through the multi-step process of accurately serializing my data for Flink processing, ensuring each step is clearly explained?","answer":"Flink uses data serialization for the purpose of both network communication and persistent storage in its state backends. This means that every object that Flink transmits or saves must be serializable. The SerializationException commonly occurs when Flink encounters types for which it does not have a built-in serializer, or those types are serialized using an inefficient process.Below are the steps to properly serialize your data for Flink:Step 1: Implement A POJOYou should use Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) for your data types. Flink can automatically infer a POJO\'s serializer including any nested types, as long as they follow certain rules, such as:- The class is public and standalone- All fields in the class and the fields of its supertypes are either public or have public getters and setters- A public no-argument constructor- The types of all fields are themselves serializableStep 2: Use Tuple TypesFlink provides a set of built-in Tuple types that can hold between 1 and 22 typed fields. The schemas of the tuple types are fully defined in their class and are therefore inherently serializable. E.g. Tuple2<String, Integer>.Step 3: Use Primitive TypesSimple types like int, long, String, etc., are also inherently serializable. For composite types, favor POJOs and Tuple types.Step 4: Define A Custom SerializerIn situations where you cannot design your type as a POJO, you will need to create a custom serializer by extending the `TypeSerializer` class. Remember to register your serializer via `TypeInformation.of(new TypeHint<YourType>() {})` and provide it to the relevant Flink operator.Step 5: Avoid Non-Deterministic Serialization SchemesIf you have to rely on Java\'s built-in serialization, keep in mind that the default serializer is non-deterministic, meaning consecutive serializations may result in different sequences of bytes for the same object. You may want to implement `java.io.Serializable` interface in your custom classes and override `writeObject` and `readObject` methods.Step 6: Avoid Using Non-Serializable Objects as Function Field ValuesOne common mistake is using non-serializable objects as function field values in Flink, ensure your objects stored in Flink functions are serializable.Step 7: Test Serialization of Job GraphProbably the best way to make sure your job graph gets serialized correctly: write a test that executes `JobGraph.toSerializableJobGraph()` on your JobGraph.Step 8: Test Serialization of Records and Managed StatesTo enhance the reliability of your Flink job, test the serialization and deserialization of any records and managed states.Remember Flink’s requirements for serializable types and always check to ensure that your data structures conform to it will help prevent the SerializationException."},{"question":"How to sort the names in alphabetical order?

Increased complexity: Nested classes increase the complexity of the code and can make it harder for other developers to understand and maintain.

Limited code reusability: Nested or inner classes can\'t be tested or reused independently of their outer class, making them less flexible in general.3.

Maintainability issues: Changes in the outer class can potentially break the nested class, and vice versa.

Poor cognition was negatively associated with overweight (BMI 23-25) with normal waist circumference.BMI could be used as a candidate risk marker to identify people at higher risk of cognitive deficits, and as an intervention target for modifications of cognitive outcomes.Obesity is a common medical illness that is increasingly recognised as conferring risk of decline in cognitive performance, independent of other comorbid medical conditions.Overweight and obesity are associated with an increased risk of subnormal intellectual performance in young adult males. Subjects with low birth weight and adolescent overweight/obesity are at particular risk of subnormal performance.Impairments in cognitive function have been associated with obesity in both people and rodents.Obesity in the pre-school years was associated with poorer outcomes for some cognitive measures in this study.

While it is established that the disease specific isoform of the prion protein, PrPSc, is an essential component of the infectious agent, the strain-specific relationship between PrPSc properties and the biological features of the resulting disease is not clear. To investigate this relationship, we examined the amplification efficiency and conformational stability of PrPSc from eight hamster-adapted prion strains and compared it to the resulting incubation period of disease and processing of PrPSc in neurons and glia. We found that short incubation period strains were characterized by more efficient PrPSc amplification and higher PrPSc conformational stabilities compared to long incubation period strains. In the CNS, the short incubation period strains were characterized by the accumulation of N-terminally truncated PrPSc in the soma of neurons, astrocytes and microglia in contrast to long incubation period strains where PrPSc did not accumulate to detectable levels in the soma of neurons but was detected in glia similar to short incubation period strains. These results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that a decrease in conformational stability results in a corresponding increase in replication efficiency and suggest that glia mediated neurodegeneration results in longer survival times compared to direct replication of PrPSc in neurons.Introduction:Prion diseases are a group of transmissible, fatal neurodegenerative diseases, which include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, and scrapie in sheep. The prion agent is comprised mainly, if not entirely, of PrPSc which is an abnormal isoform of the host encoded prion protein, PrPC[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6]. Prion propagation is thought to occur in a two-step process where PrPSc first binds to PrPC followed by a conformational conversion of PrPC to PrPSc[7],[8],[9]. This conversion results in a change in physical properties of PrPC that include an increase in β-pleated sheet content, decreased solubility in non-denaturing detergents and increased resistance to proteolytic degradation[3],[10],[11]. Prion strains are operationally defined by characteristic incubation periods and neuropathological features that are maintained upon experimental passage[12],[13]. The distribution of PrPSc in organs and neuronal populations can differ between strains, suggesting that PrPSc has a distinct strain-specific cellular tropism[14],[15],[16],[17]. The initial uptake of PrPSc by different cell-lines appears to be independent of the particular strain[18],[19] and suggests that cellular factors are responsible for prion strain tropism[17],[20], however, this has not been confirmed in vivo[21]. Prion strain diversity may be encoded by unique strain-specific conformations of PrPSc[15],[22],[23],[24],[25],[26]. Consistent with this, strain specific differences in the molecular weight of PrPSc following limited PK digestion, the relative resistance of PrPSc to degradation by PK, the relative alpha helical and beta sheet content of PrPSc, the resistance of PrPSc to PK digestion in increasing concentrations of a protein denaturant( i. e. conformational stability), and the aggregation state of PrPSc have been observed[15],[22],[27],[28]. The mechanisms underlying how strain-specific conformations of PrPSc result in the distinct biological properties of disease are poorly understood. The published reports on the relationship between the conformational stability of PrPSc and the length of the incubation period of disease between prion strains are contradictory. In murine prion strains and during adaptation of synthetic prions, a decrease in the conformational stability of PrPSc correlates with a corresponding decrease in the incubation period[5],[24],[29],[30]. One explanation for this observation is that a decrease of PrPSc stability increases PrPSc fragmentation resulting in an increase in agent replication that produces a correspondingly shorter incubation period[31],[32],[33]. Consistent with this, a decrease in Sup35 fiber stability corresponds to an increased rate of fibril fragmentation in yeast prions[33],[34]. These data contrast with what has been observed in hamster-adapted prion strains. Short incubation period prion strains have PrPSc that is conformationally more stable compared to PrPSc from strains with a relatively longer incubation periods in hamsters[27]. However, a direct comparison between PrPSc replication rate and conformational stability has not been investigated. Both the prion strain and the cell type infected can influence the processing of PrPSc. Studies of sheep infected with different prion strains, either naturally or experimentally, have identified strain-specific patterns of PrPSc truncation in both neurons and glia[35],[36]. Within a given strain the PrPSc truncation pattern can differ between glia and neurons suggesting that factors in addition to the conformation of PrPSc contribute to PrPSc truncation. While it is thought that replication in neurons is more important to disease development compared to glia, the effect of strain-specific processing of PrPSc in these cell types is less clear[37],[38],[39]. To better understand the strain specific relationship between the agent and the host, we evaluated PrPSc amplification efficiency, conformational stability of PrPSc, and susceptibility of PrPSc to endogenous proteolytic processing in vivo in several cell types, of eight hamster-adapted prion strains. Our data indicate that short incubation period strains have correspondingly more efficient replication, a higher conformational stability, and intrasomal accumulation of PrPSc in neurons compared to long incubation period strains. These data suggest that the relationship between agent replication and clearance influence the progression of disease.Discussion:Here we show that short incubation period strains have a more stable PrPSc conformation when compared to long incubation period strains. PrPSc conformational stability assays using either Gdn-HCl or SDS as the denaturant found the same relationship between the conformational stability of PrPSc and incubation period of disease indicating that this relationship is independent of the denaturant used( Table 1). This relationship between PrPSc conformational stability and incubation period is consistent with previous work examining the conformational stability of purified PrPSc from hamster-adapted prion strains[27]. In contrast to what is observed in hamsters, a decrease in the PrPSc conformational stability correlates with a reduction in the incubation period in mice[24],[29],[40]. The results in murine systems suggest that decreasing PrPSc stability increases the fragmentation of PrPSc therefore allowing in the generation of more PrPSc surfaces for PrPC to bind resulting in an increased rate of PrPSc formation and subsequently shortening of the incubation period. Consistent with this hypothesis, studies examining Sup35, PrP, Tau, α-synuclein, and ß-amyloid demonstrate that less stable fibrils have a higher propensity to undergo breakage, thereby creating new seeds for conversion[33],[34],[41],[42],[43],[44],[45]. The PrPSc conformational stability data presented here suggest that conformationally stable PrPSc may also be more susceptible to fragmentation. SDS, like Gdn-HCl, can increase the susceptibility of PrPSc to PK digestion and inactivate the agent[27],[46],[47]. Since treatment of PrPSc that is enriched using detergent extraction and ultracentrifugation with SDS results in the disaggregation of PrPSc and the production of smaller PrPSc particles, SDS can affect the aggregation state of PrPSc[32],[48]. Therefore, the higher concentration of SDS required to increase the susceptibility of PrPSc to PK digestion of short incubation period strains may be due to increased PrPSc particle size compared to long incubation period strains. Short incubation period strains have more efficient PrPSc amplification compared to long incubation period strains. We used PMCA to determine the relative efficiency of PrPSc conversion between hamster strains. We have previously shown that PMCA of HY and DY TME recapitulates the strain-specific properties of PrPSc and faithfully replicates the HY and DY TME agents[49]. In examining the eight hamster strains we found that the efficiency of PrPSc amplification correlated with the strains respective incubation periods, as the strains with more efficiently replicating PrPSc had a shorter incubation period compared to long incubation period strains( Table 1). This is consistent with cell-free conversion experiments that demonstrated a faster rate of HY PrPSc synthesis compared to the rate of DY PrPSc synthesis[50]. The data presented here also indicate that conformationally more stable PrPSc amplifies more efficiently compared to less stable PrPSc. Interestingly, the short incubation period strain HaCWD has conformationally less stable PrPSc in SDS compared to 263K and HY PrPSc which corresponded with a lower amplification efficiency compared to the two other short incubation period strains. A possible explanation for the increased amplification efficiency of PrPSc from the short incubation period strains is that this PrPSc is more likely to fragment due to its large PrPSc particle size compared to the longer incubation period strains used in this study. Alternatively, a minor subpopulation of PrPSc that is conformationally less stable may be responsible for the highly efficient PrPSc replication that was observed. This conformationally less stable subpopulation may be masked by an excess of conformationally more stable PrPSc that replicates with lower efficiency[32],[51],[52]. Strain and cell-specific variations in the proteolytic processing of PrPSc have been observed in both brain tissue and cultured cells[36],[53],[54],[55],[56]. The results presented here are consistent with these findings and additionally suggest a relationship between the extent of truncation of PrPSc within the soma of neurons and the strains respective incubation periods. The short incubation period strains, HY TME, 263K, and HaCWD, contained a longer portion of C-terminal protein intact and a large punctate deposition of PrPSc within the soma of neurons, compared to the longer incubation period strains suggesting a strain-specific clearance of PrPSc( Figures 8, Figure 9). Furthermore, the low immunoreactivity of PrPSc in ME7H infected animals observed with all six anti-PrP antibodies and within all three cell types examined( Figure 8, Table S1) may represent the more efficient clearance of PrPSc in both neurons and glia for this particular strain and account for its significantly longer incubation period. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the inability to detect intense PrPSc immunoreactivity in the soma of neurons from animals inoculated with the long incubation period strains is due to a failure of PrPSc transport to the soma. This strain-specific truncation pattern was only observed in neurons, as the same N-terminally truncated PrPSc species was detected in astrocytes and microglia for all strains examined, with the lone exception of the loss of the POM3 epitope from DY PrPSc within astrocytes( Figure 8, Figure 9). These data support the hypothesis that direct infection of neurons leads to more rapid death of neurons resulting in shorter incubation periods, compared to indirect neuronal death via infection of astrocytes and microglia[37],[38],[57]. The results presented here suggest the strain-encoded relationship between PrPSc replication, stability and processing in neurons is predictive of the incubation period of disease( Figure 9). Here we show that strains with a short incubation period have conformationally stable PrPSc that replicates efficiently. The fast replication and stable PrPSc may be responsible for the accumulation of PrPSc in the soma of neurons resulting in a shorter incubation period. The long incubation period strains displayed relatively less efficient PrPSc replication and less stable PrPSc. In these strains, the combination of a slower replicating agent and PrPSc that is less stable may result in neurons to be able to more effectively cleared of PrPSc resulting in longer incubation periods.","answer":"Prion diseases are a group of infectious fatal neurodegenerative diseases that affect animals including humans .

Different strains of the infectious agent result in characteristic incubation periods and neuropathological features within a single host species . These strain-specific differences in disease outcome are likely due to strain-specific conformations of PrPSc , though the mechanisms by which different conformation can affect prion strain properties are not understood . The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the biochemical properties of PrPSc to the corresponding neuropathological characteristics of eight hamster-adapted prion strains . Our findings indicate that PrPSc from short incubation period strains were more efficiently replicated , had a more stable conformation , and were observed to be more resistant to clearance from the soma of neurons compared to prion strains with a relatively long incubation period . These results suggest the progression of prion disease is influenced by the balance between replication and clearance of PrPSc in neurons ."},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

That is, there is still significant room to improve the architecture of volumetric CNNs. This discovery motivates our efforts in Sec 4 to improve volumetric CNNs. Additionally, low-frequency information in 3D seems to be quite discriminative for object classification—it is possible to achieve 89.5% accuracy (blue) at a resolution of only 30times 30times 30. This discovery motivates our efforts in Sec 5 to improve multi-view CNNs with a 3D multi-resolution approach.Question: The authors claim that low-frequency information in 3D is discriminative for object classification, is that true ?","answer":"The reasoning is that low-frequency information in 3D seems to be quite discriminative, because the authors use the resolution of only 30x30x30, which is really low resolution in any case.

This long-term observation provides further evidence in favour of pallidal neurostimulation as a first-line treatment for patients with medically intractable, segmental, or generalised dystonia.We describe a patient who received bilateral globus pallidus internus DBS for dystonia with initially good clinical response, but the device eventually failed.Bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation for the treatment of patients with dystonia-choreoathetosis cerebral palsy: a prospective pilot study.Bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation (BP-DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is an effective treatment for primary dystonia, but the effect of this reversible surgical procedure on dystonia-choreoathetosis CP, which is a subtype of secondary dystonia, is unknown.INTERPRETATION: Bilateral pallidal neurostimulation could be an effective treatment option for patients with dystonia-choreoathetosis CP.Pallidal deep-brain stimulation in primary generalized or segmental dystonia.BACKGROUND: Neurostimulation of the internal globus pallidus has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of primary dystonia.CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral pallidal neurostimulation for 3 months was more effective than sham stimulation in patients with primary generalized or segmental dystonia.OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation (DBS) on mood and cognitive performance in patients with dystonia before surgery (at baseline, while patients received their usual treatment) and 12 months postoperatively (while patients received neurostimulation and their medications) in a multicenter prospective study.CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral pallidal stimulation has a good benefit-to-risk ratio as it did not negatively affect cognitive performance and mood in primary dystonia, while a significant motor improvement was obtained.Despite that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is emerging as the favored intervention for patients with medically intractable dystonia, the pathophysiological mechanisms of dystonia are largely unclear. In eight patients with primary dystonia who were treated with bilateral chronic pallidal stimulation, we correlated symptom-related electromyogram (EMG) activity of the most affected muscles with the local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the globus pallidus electrodes.Bilateral deep-brain stimulation of the globus pallidus in primary generalized dystonia.METHODS: We performed a prospective, controlled, multicenter study assessing the efficacy and safety of bilateral pallidal stimulation in 22 patients with primary generalized dystonia.CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the efficacy and safety of the use of bilateral stimulation of the internal globus pallidus in selected patients with primary generalized dystonia.Bilateral pallidotomy or pallidal stimulation may provide major benefit especially in patients with generalized, disabling dystonia with the most dramatic improvements in dystonia type 1 patients.This suggests that neurostimulation of the VIM may be an effective treatment for myoclonus in pharmacologically intractable IMDS.We report on the effects of bilateral neurostimulation of the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus (VIM) in a patient with medically intractable and progressing inherited myoclonus dystonia syndrome (IMDS).Neurostimulation of the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus in inherited myoclonus-dystonia syndrome.Pallidal and thalamic neurostimulation in severe tardive dystonia.After informed consent, a bilateral stereotactic electrode placement targeting the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus (VIM) and the globus pallidus internus (GPi) was performed.Stimulation of the VIM did not improve the hyperkinetic movements and simultaneous stimulation of both the GPi and the VIM did not result in any additional benefit.Bilateral pallidal neurostimulation could be an effective treatment option for patients with dystonia-choreoathetosis CP.3 years and 5 years after surgery, pallidal neurostimulation continues to be an effective and relatively safe treatment option for patients with severe idiopathic dystonia.This long-term observation provides further evidence in favour of pallidal neurostimulation as a first-line treatment for patients with medically intractable, segmental, or generalised dystonia.INTERPRETATION: 3 years and 5 years after surgery, pallidal neurostimulation continues to be an effective and relatively safe treatment option for patients with severe idiopathic dystonia.This long-term observation provides further evidence in favour of pallidal neurostimulation as a first-line treatment for patients with medically intractable, segmental, or generalised dystonia.Bilateral pallidal neurostimulation could be an effective treatment option for patients with dystonia-choreoathetosis CP3 years and 5 years after surgery, pallidal neurostimulation continues to be an effective and relatively safe treatment option for patients with severe idiopathic dystonia","answer":"globus pallidus internus"},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

This study sought to examine whether mirtazapine improves retention and alleviates methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms in an out-patient setting.                An out-patient double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial of mirtazapine for the treatment of methamphetamine withdrawal was conducted (15 mg nocte for 2 days, 30 mg nocte for 12 days). Both groups were offered narrative therapy counselling. Measures recorded on days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 35 included: treatment retention, Amphetamine Cessation Symptoms Assessment, the Athens Insomnia Scale, the Brief Symptom Inventory, the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale (DASS), Severity of Dependence scale and the Opiate Treatment Index Drug Use subscale.                Thirty-one participants were recruited (18 placebo, 13 mirtazapine) and 52% completed the 2-week medication phase. No significant differences between the mirtazapine and placebo groups in retention, or any symptom measure were observed, except greater DASS-anxiety and longer sleep duration were measured at baseline among the mirtazapine group.                Results suggest that mirtazapine does not facilitate retention or recruitment in out-patient methamphetamine withdrawal treatment, although recruitment may have been insufficient to identify a significant treatment effect. The potential role of narrative therapy for methamphetamine dependent patients deserves further exploration.Title 2:Mirtazapine in amphetamine detoxification: a placebo-controlled pilot study.Abstract 2:The present study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of mirtazapine in amphetamine detoxification in a 14-day randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial in a Thai population. Subjects retained at a Specialized Probation Center, Department of Probation, Ministry of Justice, Thailand (n=20), who met DSM-IV criteria for amphetamine dependence and the inclusion criteria of the study, were randomized for either mirtazapine treatment or placebo. Efficacy was assessed by the Amphetamine Withdrawal Questionnaire (AWQ) for amphetamine withdrawal symptoms and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression rating scale (MADRS) for depression. Mirtazapine safety was assessed by interview during each follow-up period on days 3 and 14 after treatment. Nine subjects were randomized to the mirtazapine group and 11 to the placebo group. Among the initial 20 subjects, 16 (seven in the mirtazapine and nine in the placebo group) completed the study. There were significant improvements in the total AWQ score changes in the mirtazapine group versus placebo both at days 3 (P<0.005) and 14 (P<0.030). Significant improvements in favour of mirtazapine were also seen in the hyperarousal and the anxiety subscale score changes at days 3 (P<0.029) and 14 (P<0.018), respectively. No significant differences were seen (P>0.05) in the MADRS scores changes within or between the groups. Mild adverse events, such as headache, sedation, nausea and vomiting, were reported. In conclusion, despite its small sample size, this randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial lends support to the hypothesis that mirtazapine may be an option in the meager armamentarium of amphetamine detoxification treatment.Title 3:Amineptine in the treatment of amphetamine withdrawal: a placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind study.Abstract 3:Temporary inability to function without amphetamine and the experience of withdrawal syndrome enhance the tendency for repetitive use. The investigators proposed to examine the therapeutic effects of amineptine, an antidepressant with dopamine reuptake inhibition effect, for the treatment of amphetamine withdrawal. The 14-day study was carried out on a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. The authors assessed the severity of amphetamine withdrawal syndrome by using two measures and performed both end-point and intent-to-treat analyses. The results showed that amineptine helped relieve a depressed mood within one week and improved the general condition within 2 weeks. In conclusion, amineptine is effective in rapid relief of depressed mood and improves the general condition of patients with amphetamine withdrawal. Since the amphetamine withdrawal may last for several weeks, studies with longer duration should be conducted before incorporating amineptine into the clinical practice a of amphetamine withdrawal treatment.","answer":"No medication is effective for treatment of amphetamine withdrawal. Amineptine showed reduction in discontinuation rates and improvement in clinical presentation compared to placebo, but had no effect on reducing withdrawal symptoms or craving. In spite of these limited benefits, amineptine is not available for use due to concerns over abuse liability when using the drug. The benefits of mirtazapine as a withdrawal agent are less clear based on findings from two randomised controlled trials: one report showed improvements in amphetamine withdrawal symptoms over placebo; a second report showed no differences in withdrawal symptoms compared to placebo.  Further potential treatment studies should examine medications that increase central nervous system activity involving dopamine, norepinephrine and/or serotonin neurotransmitters, including mirtazapine."},{"question":"You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition.

This issue is exacerbated for rural Latino population s. In this study , we assessed whether neurocognitive assessment  via telepsychiatry ( TP ) using a Spanish- language battery would be comparable to in-person ( IP ) testing using the same battery in a sample of Spanish-speaking older adults in a rural setting . Patients ( N = 22 ) received IP and TP testing 2 weeks apart . The order of IP and TP test administrations in individual subjects was determined r and omly . Comparison of scores indicated that there were no significant differences between IP and TP test performance though both groups scored non-significantly higher at the second visit . This study demonstrates feasibility and utility of neurocognitive testing in Spanish using TP among older rural LatinosTitle 2:The Method Quality of Cross-Over Studies Involved in Cochrane Systematic ReviewsAbstract 2:Background It is possible that cross-over studies included in current systematic review s are being inadequately assessed , because the current risk of bias tools do not consider possible biases specific to cross-over design . We performed this study to evaluate whether this was being done in  cross-over studies included in Cochrane  Systematic Review s ( CSRs ) . Methods We search ed the Cochrane Library ( up to 2013 issue 5 ) for CSRs that included at least one cross-over trial . Two authors independently undertook the study selection and data extraction . A r and om sample of the CSRs was selected and we evaluated whether the cross-over trials in these CSRs were assessed according to criteria suggested by the Cochrane h and book . In addition we reassessed the risk of bias of these cross-over trials by a checklist developed form the Cochrane h and book . Results We identified 688 CSRs that included one or more cross-over studies . We chose a r and om sample of 60 CSRs and these included 139 cross-over studies . None of these CSRs undertook a risk of bias assessment specific for cross-over studies . In fact items specific for cross-over studies were seldom considered anywhere in quality assessment of these CSRs . When we reassessed the risk of bias , including the 3 items specific to cross-over trials , of these 139 studies , a low risk of bias was judged for appropriate cross-over design in 110(79 % ) , carry-over effects in 48(34 % ) and for reporting data in all stages of the trial in 114(82 % ) . Assessment of biases in cross-over trials could affect the GRADE assessment of a review ’s findings . Conclusion The current Cochrane risk of bias tool is not adequate to assess cross-over studies . Items specific to cross-over trials leading to potential risk of bias are generally neglected in CSRs . A proposed check list for the evaluation of cross-over trials is providedTitle 3:Practice effects and the use of alternate forms in serial neuropsychological testing.Abstract 3:Accurate underst and ing of practice characteristics , performance stability , and error on neuropsychological tests is essential to both valid clinical assessment and maximization of signal detection for clinical trials of cognitive enhancing drugs . We examined practice effects in 28 healthy adults . As part of a larger study using donepezil and simulating a Phase I trial , participants were r and omized into : placebo , no-treatment and donepezil . Donepezil results are presented elsewhere . Neuropsychological tests were administered in a fixed order for 6 weeks , with alternate forms available for most tests . Despite alternate forms , ANOVAs revealed significant improvements for the pooled control group ( placebo and no-treatment ) on all tests except Letter Number Sequencing and Trails B. Learning occurred principally in the first three to four sessions . PASAT and Stroop interference showed the greatest learning . Thus , serial assessment with alternate forms may attenuate retest effects on some tests , but continued learning occurs on novel tests or those in which an advantageous test-taking strategy can be identified . Alternate forms and baseline practice sessions may help control early , rapid improvements in clinical trialsTitle 4:In-Person Versus Telehealth Assessment of Discourse Ability in Adults With Traumatic Brain InjuryAbstract 4:Objectives : To compare in-person versus telehealth ( TH ) assessment of discourse ability in adults with chronic traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . Design : Repeated- measures design with r and om order of conditions . Participants : Twenty adults with moderate-to-severe TBI . Method : Participants completed conversation , picture description , story-generation , and procedural description tasks . Sessions were video-recorded and transcribed . Measures : Measures of productivity and quality of discourse . Results : Significant differences between conditions were not detected in this sample , and feedback from participants was positive . Conclusions : These preliminary results support the use of TH for the assessment of discourse ability in adults with TBI , at least for individuals with sufficient cognitive skills to follow TH proceduresTitle 5:BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION AND THERAPEUTIC EXPOSURE FOR POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER: A NONINFERIORITY TRIAL OF TREATMENT DELIVERED IN PERSON VERSUS HOME-BASED TELEHEALTH.Abstract 5:OBJECTIVE Combat veterans returning to society with impairing mental health conditions such as PTSD and major depression ( MD ) report significant barriers to care related to aspects of traditional psychotherapy service delivery ( e.g. , stigma , travel time , and cost ) . Hence , alternate treatment delivery methods are needed . Home-based telehealth ( HBT ) is one such option ; however , this delivery mode has not been compared to in person , clinic-based care for PTSD in adequately powered trials . The present study was design ed to compare relative noninferiority of evidence -based psychotherapies for PTSD and MD , specifically Behavioral Activation  and  Therapeutic Exposure  ( BA-TE ) , when delivered via HBT versus in person , in clinic delivery . METHOD A repeated measures ( i.e. , baseline , posttreatment , 3- , 6-month follow-up ) r and omized controlled design powered for noninferiority analyses was used to compare PTSD and MD symptom improvement in response to BA-TE delivered via HBT versus in person , in clinic conditions . Participants were 232 veterans diagnosed with full criteria or predefined subthreshold PTSD . RESULTS PTSD and MD symptom improvement following BA-TE delivered by HBT was comparable to that of BA-TE delivered in person at posttreatment and at 3- and 12-month follow-up . CONCLUSION Evidence -based psychotherapy for PTSD and depression can be safely and effectively delivered via HBT with clinical outcomes paralleling those of clinic-based care delivered in person . HBT , thereby , addresses barriers to care related to both logistics and stigmaTitle 6:Real-time teleophthalmology in rural Western Australia.Abstract 6:OBJECTIVE This study aims to assess the current utilisation of a  real-time teleophthalmology service for rural Western Australia ( WA ) . DESIGN Service evaluation by prospect i ve audit . SETTING Includes general practice s , optometrists , hospitals in rural WA and the Lions Eye Institute in Perth . PARTICIPANTS Eighty-five patients from rural WA participating . INTERVENTIONS Video consultation ( VC ) with a general ophthalmologist . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Number of referring practitioners and their locations , software and imaging equipment used as well as the presentation , working diagnosis and follow-up plan for each consultation . RESULTS Eighty-five participants took part in a total of 100 VCs  in the 5-month data collection period . There were 49 men ( 58 % ) ; age range 7 - 92 years ; 31 identified as Indigenous Australian ( 37 % ) . Participants were referred by optometrists ( 59 % ) , hospital district medical officers ( 23 % ) and GPs ( 18 % ) . Karratha ( 41 % ) , Albany ( 20 % ) and Broome ( 14 % ) were the main VC locations . There were 31 different eye conditions managed ; red eye , acute vision loss , known glaucoma and abnormal retinal photographs were the main presentations . Skype was the commonly used software ( 71 % ) . Images were provided in 63 % of all VCs . The main equipment used included digital retinal cameras ( 56 % ) , smartphones ( 25 % ) and digital slit lamps ( 13 % ) . An outpatient appointment with the ophthalmologist was recommended following 35 VCs . CONCLUSIONS Optometrists used this service most frequently , despite a lack of financial incentive . Digital retinal cameras and smartphones were the most commonly used imaging modalities . Overall , real-time teleophthalmology was used in the management of a broad range of eye conditions and was a useful supplement to outreach ophthalmology servicesTitle 7:Identifying undiagnosed dementia in residential care veterans: comparing telemedicine to in-person clinical examination.Abstract 7:BACKGROUND Dementia is a common but frequently undiagnosed problem in aging . Barriers to early diagnosis include a lack of routine screening for dementia and a lack of access to specialty consultative services . We conducted a pilot study to see if telemedicine could provide reliable , accurate geriatric consultative services to evaluate patients for dementia who were residing at remote sites . METHODS This was a prospect i ve cohort study that compared the diagnostic reliability of telemedicine to an in-person examination for dementia . Eligible subjects were residents of a Washington State Veterans \' Home , age 60 years or older , with no prior diagnosis of dementia . Eligible subjects were screened for dementia using the 7-Minute Screen . Veterans who screened positive and consented to participate in the study received an in-person neuropsychiatric evaluation at baseline , and then both telemedicine and in-person examinations for dementia conducted by experienced geriatric psychiatrists . The accuracy of the telemedicine diagnosis was estimated by comparing it to the diagnosis from the clinical examination . Three geriatric psychiatrists who were blinded to the results of the clinical examination conducted the telemedicine and in-person examinations . We also assessed attitudes of the subjects and geriatric psychiatrists towards the telemedicine sessions . RESULTS Eighteen of 85 subjects screened were \' positive \' for dementia on the 7 Minute Screen . Of these , 16 consented to participate in the telemedicine study . Twelve of the 16 subjects were subsequently diagnosed with dementia by the telemedicine examination . The telemedicine diagnoses were in 100 % agreement with the diagnoses from the in-person clinical examinations . Moreover , the subjects reported a high degree of satisfaction with the telemedicine experience and that they would like to have further care through telemedicine in the future . The geriatric psychiatrists reported technical difficulties with the audio-visual quality of telemedicine in the initial phases of the project that resolved as familiarity with the telemedicine equipment increased . None of these problems had an adverse impact on the diagnostic accuracy of telemedicine . CONCLUSIONS We found that telemedicine was as accurate as an in-person clinical examination in establishing the diagnosis of dementia . In addition , subjects reported a high degree of satisfaction with telemedicine and a willingness to participate in telemedicine clinical care in the future . Given the large increase in the aging population and the shortage of geriatric psychiatrists nationally , it appears that telemedicine may be a promising means to exp and the availability of geriatric psychiatric consultation to remote areasTitle 8:Reliability of the MMSE administered in-person and by telehealth.Abstract 8:BACKGROUND Recent advances in telehealth have improved access to health care for those in rural areas . It is important that examinations conducted via telehealth are comparable to in-person testing . A rural and remote memory clinic in Saskatoon provided an opportunity to compare scores on the  Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) administered in-person and via telehealth . METHODS After an initial one day assessment in Saskatoon , patients were seen in follow-up at 6 and 12 weeks . Individual patients were r and omly assigned to either in-person follow-up assessment in Saskatoon or telehealth assessment in their home community . Patients who initially received in-person assessment s were seen by telehealth for their next follow-up visit and vice-versa . The same neurologist administered MMSEs at all visits . The first 71 patients with both 6 and 12 week follow-up assessment s were included in this study . The scores of in-person and  telehealth MMSE administrations were compared using the methods of Bl and and Altman as well as a paired t-test . RESULTS MMSE scores did not differ significantly between telehealth ( 22.34 + /- 6.35 ) and in-person ( 22.70 + /- 6.51 ) assessment s. CONCLUSION Telehealth provides an acceptable means of assessing mental status of patients in remote areasTitle 9:Preliminary evaluation of a Low-Cost VideoConferencing (LCVC) system for remote cognitive testing of adult psychiatric patients.Abstract 9:Mini-Mental State Examination scores were compared in an adult psychiatric population when the test was performed face to face and over a Low-Cost VideoConferencing System ( LCVC ) . The minor changes to the instrument that are required to make it compatible with the LCVC are described . The high correlations achieved between the test scores in the two conditions suggests that this cognitive screening test may be reliably performed in this group of patients over the LCVC","answer":"Test specific analyses indicated that verbally-mediated tasks including digit span , verbal fluency , and list learning were not affected by videoconference administration ."},{"question":"Devise a sophisticated AI mechanism that can proficiently administer and enhance the processing of 6D model files, thereby augmenting the immersive experience in mixed reality environments.

The AI mechanism should also be competent in optimizing 6D models that are part of a complex, multi-method system, where the optimization process needs to take into account the interactions between multiple methods and the 6D models.","answer":"Designing an AI mechanism that can meet these rigorous requirements involves a multi-faceted approach, combining techniques from machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and other areas of AI. Here is a general blueprint:1. AI Architecture: A hybrid AI architecture combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for visual processing, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for temporal processing, and reinforced learning for making optimization decisions.2. Model Processing: To effectively manage multiple 6D models, the mechanism uses multiple threads and GPU-based parallelism. It leverages cloud computing to distribute the load further. Models are stored and processed in a distributed file system, allowing the AI to access and optimise them simultaneously.3. Model Simplification: A sophisticated vertex-reduction algorithm will handle model simplification, reducing the total polygon count without significantly impacting visual appearance. The algorithm will handle this intelligently, maintaining the quality of visually significant parts while reducing detail in less important areas.4. Real-Time Optimization: Applying reinforcement learning strategies, the AI mechanism can make real-time decisions about model complexity based on the immediate scenario and hardware capabilities of the device in use.5. Interactive Elements & Animations: The AI mechanism will use a separate process to handle 6D animations and interactivity, ensuring optimization without compromising functionality. 6. Advanced Features: For incorporating and optimizing advanced features like lighting, particles, and external resources (textures, shaders), the AI engine will employ specialized optimization algorithms, balancing visual appearance and performance.7. AI-Assisted Predictive Optimizations: By incorporating an element of predictive analytics, the AI mechanism can anticipate future changes in the models and modify the optimization process accordingly.8. Reporting: The AI mechanism will produce detailed reports after each optimization, documenting the changes made, the time saved and the impact on visual fidelity.9. Multiplayer & Concurrent System Optimization: For large-scale multiplayer environments or multi-threaded systems, the mechanism uses a decentralized design, where each node or thread has a localized model of the 6D environment and optimizes locally.10. Support for Complex Systems: When integrated with complex systems like Blockchain and Quantum, the AI mechanism takes account of the nuances of these systems and provides a further layer of optimization, considering the interactions between nodes or qubits, respectively.11. Machine Learning and Complex Algorithmic Systems: The AI mechanism is designed to work efficiently with complex, high-level algorithms such as deep learning systems, genetic algorithm systems, and swarm intelligence systems, optimizing their interactions with the 6D models.12. Future Adaptability: With the ability to learn from its experiences and adapt to new scenarios, the AI mechanism ensures continual improvement and future readiness.This complex AI mechanism can revolutionize the way we process and manage 6D model files, offering an unprecedented level of efficiency and performance. However, the design and implementation of such a system would pose a significant challenge and would likely require extensive research and development."},{"question":"Define a function that takes two strings as arguments and returns a string composed of the characters that appear in both of the strings.x = \\"apple\\"y = \\"carrot\\"","answer":"Here is a function in Python:```pythondef common_chars(str1, str2):    return \'\'.join(set(str1) & set(str2))x = \\"apple\\"y = \\"carrot\\"print(common_chars(x, y))```This function uses set intersection (& operator) to find common characters in both strings.

The reduce() method applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single output value.Here is a simple script that will do this:```javascriptlet numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]let sum = numbers.reduce(function(accumulator, currentValue) {  return accumulator + currentValue;});console.log(sum)  // it will log 15```In the script above, the reduce() function will take each value from the array one by one (from left to right). For each value, it will execute the function that adds the current value to the accumulator. The result of this function will be saved in the accumulator for the next iteration or will be returned if there are no more values in the array. The initial value of the accumulator is the first element in the array if no initial value is provided.This script can also be written with arrow function as:```javascriptlet numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]let sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue);console.log(sum)  // it will log 15```"},{"question":"I have 3 points in a 3D space of which I know the exact locations.

So for example `(x0,y0,z0)` will be `(x0\',y0\')`, and `(x1,y1,z1)` will be `(x1\',y1\')` and `(x2,y2,z2)` will be `(x2\',y2\')` from the camera\'s point of view.What is the easiest way to find the projection matrix that will project those 3D points into 2D points on camera view plane. We don\'t know anything about the camera location.","answer":"The problem you\'re trying to solve falls in the broad category of camera calibration in 3D computer vision. The projection matrix you\'re trying to find is typically called the camera matrix or the camera projection matrix. The simplest way to find this projection matrix is to take 4 points instead of 3 in 3D space and their corresponding 2D points in camera plane and follow the linear approach known as Direct Linear Transformation (DLT).The projection from a point M=(X,Y,Z) in 3D space to a point m=(x,y) in the image can be written as:P * M = mHere, P is the matrix we want to compute.However, we only have 3 points and you typically need at least 6 correspondences to compute the projection matrix. Indeed, the projection matrix has 11 degrees of freedom (it\'s a 3x4 matrix up to scale) and each correspondence gives you 2 equations (x and y in the image).Therefore, with only 3 correspondences, the problem has no unique solution. If however, you can make additional assumptions (such as: the camera is orthogonal, the camera aspect ratio is known, etc.), then you can reduce the number of unknowns and might be able to find a solution. For general camera models and without additional assumptions, three points are not enough."},{"question":"Write a loop in Java to calculate the sum and product of all elements in a given array, and find the maximum and minimum elements.

As you\'ve observed, it\'s often the case than an epoch with top performance on the validation set doesn\'t necessarily yield the best results on the test set. Here are some best practices that you could follow:1. Early Stopping: Instead of saving checkpoints every N epochs, save the model whenever the validation score improves. Set a patience parameter (a number of epochs without improvement after which the training will be stopped) and a delta parameter (minimum change in the validation score to be considered as an improvement).2. Averaging Checkpoints: Sometimes, it\'s better to average several recent checkpoints instead of choosing the one with the highest validation score. This smoother model can often generalize better.3. Learning Rate Schedule: If your KPI is fluctuating a lot, try to add a learning rate scheduler in your training. Reducing learning rate when the validation score plateaus can often stabilize training.4. Use more data: Split your data into train/validation/test sets in a way such that your model can generalise more broadly. If your validation set is very similar to your train set, it will not be a good measure of how your model will perform on unseen data.5. Cross-Validation: If your dataset is small, use k-fold cross-validation. Each fold will have a slight variation in train-val dataset, and hence the corresponding checkpoint models. You can either select checkpoint from fold which has the best validation performance, or you can ensembles these checkpoint models.6. Evaluate more metrics: Balance accuracy is not the only metric you can refer to in classification tasks. Depending on the task, precision, recall or F1 score can give you a more comprehensive understanding about your model. You can select the checkpoint based on the trade-off between these metrics."},{"question":"In college I\'ve had numerous design and [UML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) oriented courses, and I recognize that UML can be used to benefit a software project, especially [use-case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case) mapping, but is it really practical?

Many good answers, and though not the most verbose, I belive the one selected is the most balanced.","answer":"UML can be very useful in complex projects, especially those involving multiple teams, as it provides a standardized language to communicate the architecture and design of the software. It\'s especially beneficial when there large, complex systems with many different interacting components.The practicality really depends on the project and the team. For small projects, it could be seen as overkill. But for larger projects, it can be an indispensable communication tool, ensuring everyone is on the same page and reducing confusion or misunderstandings about the architecture or functionality. As for specific diagrams, different diagrams serve different purposes and can be more or less useful depending on the situation. Some of the most commonly used ones are:- Use Case Diagrams: depict the different ways the system can be used by external actors. - Class Diagrams: visualize the static structure of a system including classes, attributes, operations, and relationships.- Sequence Diagrams: illustrates how different parts of the system interact with each other in a specific use case.- Activity Diagrams: show the dynamic flow of control within the system.- Component Diagrams: represent the structural relationship between software system\'s components.- State Diagrams: depict the different states that objects in the system transition through.In the end, the key is to use UML judiciously and not to let it become a hindrance.

The squirrel can only take at most one nut at one time and can move in four directions - up, down, left and right, to the adjacent cell. The distance is represented by the number of moves. However, there are obstacles in the grid that the squirrel cannot pass through.

The main points to consider in the solution would be:1) Initialize a 2D boolean array (with default values as false) of the same size as the grid to keep track of the cells that have been visited.2) Next, you calculate the total distance that the squirrel would need to travel if there were no obstacles in the grid. This would simply be sum of the Manhattan distances from each nut to the tree (include the distance from the squirrel to the first nut).3) Now, perform an A* search from each nut to the tree. For each search, if there is a path to the tree, subtract the previously calculated non-obstacle distance for that nut, and add the new path length found by the search. If there is no path, then the task is impossible.4) Repeat the above step for each nut in the grid.5) The minimum overall distance is then the initial total distance, plus the sum of all the adjustment for each nut (which may be negative, if a nut was closer to the tree than estimated, or positive, if it was further).Note that the A* search algorithm uses a priority queue, sorted by the estimated total cost of a path (this is the cost so far, plus a heuristic estimate of the cost to get to the goal). When a cell is dequeued, if it\'s the goal cell, you\'ve found your path. If it\'s not, you enqueue all its neighbors that haven\'t been dequeued yet, with their cost set to the cost of the current cell plus the cost to move to the neighbor.Remember to always check if the position of the neighbor cell is valid i.e., it\'s within the grid, and it\'s not an obstacle or already visited."},{"question":"Refactor the following section of code:In this programming test, you are provided with a vector of integers.

Your response should include the abstract and no additional text.Paper text:minimal supersymmtric standard model possesses many remarkable features that allows one to think of it as of the most viable candidate for a theory that describes physics beyond the standard model .unfortunately , it has a lot of parameters which are related to unknown masses of susy particles .one way to deal with the problem is to use universal parameters at some high - energy scale and extrapolate them to low energies with the help of renormalization group equations ( rges ) .most of the computer codes @xcite used to obtain the susy spectrum incorporate two - loop rges together with one - loop threshold corrections .the latter allow one to calculate boundary values for gauge and yukawa couplings from the given low - energy input in a consistent way .the necessity of threshold corrections is tightly related to the fact that the theories defined in a minimal subtraction scheme cease to satisfy the appelquist - carazzone theorem @xcite in a naive form .heavy degrees of freedom contribute to low energy observables even in the limit when the corresponding masses tend to infinity introducing potentially large logarithmic corrections .however , the latter are local and can be absorbed in the definition of the couplings of the effective theory and summed up with the help of a renormalization group .there exists a so - called matching ( or decoupling ) procedure that allows one to routinely calculate threshold corrections .one - loop decoupling corrections can be found in  @xcite .it turns out that sometimes they can significantly change ( e.g. by 40  % for the @xmath0-quark mass ) the value of the parameters defined in the mssm with respect to that in the sm . in such casesit is reasonable to calculate contributions from the next order of perturbation theory ( pt ) .it took some time to find leading two - loop corrections to matching relations between the strongest sm and mssm couplings .strong coupling was considered in  @xcite .the corresponding results for heavy sm fermion masses were found in  @xcite    it is worth mentioning that the low - energy input to the mssm can be given in terms of running sm parameters at the electroweak scale .however , there exists a distinction in minimal renormalization schemes usually used in the sm and mssm .it comes from the fact that supersymmetry requires vector bosons to be accompanied by so - called @xmath1-scalars .the latter maintain the balance between fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom in a dimensionally regularized theory . as a consequence, most calculations in the context of the mssm made use of the so - called -scheme @xcite with @xmath1-scalars implicitly ( or explicitly ) taken into account .this fact leads to the problem of @xmath2 conversion since for the standard model the @xmath3 scheme is more suitable .the corresponding parameter redefinition can be done in a conventional way by comparison of certain ( invariant ) quantities calculated in both schemes within the same model ( sm or mssm ) .however , this route leads to appearance of unphysical `` evanescent \'\' couplings if such relations are considered in the sm @xcite or to supersymmetry breaking at rigid level in the mssm .recently , it was proposed that @xmath4 parameters of the mssm and @xmath3 parameters of the sm can be directly related since unphysical @xmath1-scalars can be treated along the same lines as heavy degrees of freedom during calculation of decoupling corrections @xcite .let me introduce necessary notation and briefly discuss practical prescription for the matching procedure @xcite .the task is to find relations of the type @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are some running parameters ( e.g. , @xmath8 ) defined at the renormalization scale @xmath9 in the effective ( sm ) and the fundamental ( mssm ) theories , respectively .the quantity @xmath10 is called `` decoupling constant \'\' for the parameter @xmath11 and can be calculated order - by - order in pt .the relation allows one to express @xmath11 in terms of @xmath12 and other parameters of the fundamental theory at any scale @xmath9 . in practice , however , the scale is chosen in a way to minimize uncertainties due high orders of pt .    a convenient way to findthe expression for @xmath13 is to consider bare quantities and find `` bare \'\' decoupling constant @xmath14 @xmath15 by demanding that bare green functions calculated in both theories coincide in the limit of vanishing external momenta and masses of the considered effective field theory . in this caseall the diagrams without heavy degrees of freedom also vanish and the problem is reduced to calculation of bubble integrals with at least one heavy line with mass denoted here by @xmath16. given one expresses bare quantities in terms of renormalized ones @xmath17 bigl[,underline{z_a},(underline{a } ) ,bigr]^{-1 }       ,      zeta_{a,0}(z_a  , a , z_b  , b ,  , z_m m )      .label{decoupling : renormalized}end{aligned} ] ] and after a proper re - expansion obtains . in @xmath18 stands for couplings presented in the fundamental theory that are absent in the effective one .let us consider one- and two - loop contributions to the decoupling constants for the strong coupling , @xmath19 , the mass of bottom - quark , @xmath20 , and the tau - lepton mass , @xmath21 .due to the fact that full two - loop calculations require evaluation of many thousands of diagrams , it is reasonable to consider a simplified setup and neglect electroweak gauge couplings . in this case , five - flavor qcd with free tau - lepton plays the role of effective theory instead of the sm .the corresponding limit of the mssm ( `` gauge - less \'\' limit ) is treated as a more fundamental theory and is used to calculate threshold corrections .[ cols= \\" < , < \\" , ]     the first three - loop analysis of the mssm was performed in @xcite and it was found that the effect of three - loop running on the susy spectrum is small for weakly interacting particles but is larger for squark masses ( 1 - 5  % ) . however , two - loop threshold corrections were not available at those times . in thistalk i will present the results of a more consistent study based on modified version of the softsusy @xcite code which takes into account both three - loop rges and two - loop decoupling corrections discussed earlier .    as a benchmark scenariothe so - called sps4 point @xcite was chosen .for this point one has @xmath22  gev , @xmath23  gev , @xmath24 at the gut scale , and @xmath25 at the electroweak scale . in order to visualize the impact of additional two - loop terms in decoupling corrections and three - loop contributions to beta - functions , the spectrum produced by the softsusy code is presented for four cases .    in fig .[ fig : spec]a one sees how two - loop corrections to @xmath0- ( green arrows ) and @xmath26-quark ( blue arrows ) masses modify the initial spectrum of sps4 obtained with the original softsusy 3.1 code .quark yukawa couplings influence significantly the running of soft masses for the corresponding higgs bosons .this , in turn , leads to the relatively large shifts in the masses of heavy higgses ( 4 - 5  % ) and higgsinos ( 2 - 3  % ) .however , the overall result for heavy higgs masses is small ( less than 1  % ) due to cancellations .inclusion of @xmath27 ( red arrows ) slightly lowers the masses of third generation squarks below the initial value .    this picture for quark masses and strong couplingwas obtained without the inclusion of three - loop terms in rges . figure  [ fig : spec]b shows the impact of these additional terms .first of all , for comparison with the results of ref .  @xcite the spectrum was calculated without two - loop threshold corrections ( green arrows ) .as it was noticed by the previous authors the corrections due to three - loop terms are small and mostly influence strongly interacting particles ( by 1 - 2  % ) . after the inclusion of calculated two - loop decoupling correctionsone can see additional shifts for squarks , gluino , and neutralino / chargino with large higgsino component . in the end, one has 1 - 2  % overall correction to the masses of strongly interacting particles and 3  % correction to the higgsino masses .it is also interesting to note that the inclusion of three - loop rges lowers the value of the lightest higgs boson mass from 114 gev down to 113 gev ( not shown in fig .[ fig : spec]b ) .some two - loop threshold corrections to the sm parameters were calculated and numerically studied in a wide region of the parameters space of the mssm .it turns out that for the considered region two - loop contributions to the decoupling constants of the strong coupling and heavy quark masses are of the order of 2 - 4  % and do not depend significantly on @xmath28 . since tau - leptondoes not participate in strong interactions , the corresponding correction to its mass is smaller than that of quarks .nevertheless , for large @xmath29 it can reach the value of 1  % which exceeds current experimental uncertainty of the tau - lepton pole mass .a proper way to use the above - mentioned two - loop quantities is to incorporate them together with three - loop rges in a code used to calculate the susy mass spectrum . for this purposethe softsusy package has been modified and it was found how the corrections influence the spectrum . a numerical study was performed for a particular scenario sps4 with large @xmath29 for which certain decoupling corrections are expected to be large .the overall effect of the three - loop running on the mass spectrum turns out to be small and does not exceed a few per cent . in comparison with previous studiesit was found that the inclusion of the decoupling corrections besides lowering squark masses leads to a decrease in gluino and higgsino masses .plane where no ewsb occurs .the green region was obtained with the help of two - loop rges and the red one  with three - loop terms .it is clear that the so - called egret @xcite point is not allowed by three - loop analysis . ]it is also interesting to study the influence on allowed regions in the parameter space .for example , the boundary that separates the regions with and without electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) can be significantly shifted .figure  [ fig : noewsb ] shows how the forbidden region increases after taking into account three - loop rges and the corresponding threshold effects . the so - called `` egret point \'\' proposed in @xciteis also shown and it looks like three - loop evolution excludes it .therefore , one should be careful when choosing particular values of parameters near boundaries of the allowed region .moreover , although being small the calculated corrections give us an opportunity to estimate theoretical uncertainties of the susy parameters fitted with the help of two - loop rges .this seems to be more reliable than ( or at least complementary to ) the comparison between the results of different computer codes .    at the end, i would like to thank the organizers of the `` quarks 2010 \'\' seminar for the opportunity to participate in such a nice event .financial support from rfbr grant 08 -

Numbers cannot be repeated until all possible have been generated.","answer":"There are a number of ways to achieve this, but most of them aren\'t straightforward or possible purely with JavaScript. You may need to use browser storage, like localStorage, to persist check on already generated numbers across different runs but it only works in a browser not on runtime of individual executions like in server-side Node.js. Here\'s an example where we serialize the tracker to localStorage:```JavaScriptvar min = 0;var max = 10;// Get the array if it exists, if not initialize itvar generated = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(\'generated\')) || [];// If all numbers have been generated, resetif(generated.length == max + 1) {    generated = [];}// Generate unique random numbersvar num;do {    num = Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;} while(generated.includes(num));// Push the new number and savegenerated.push(num);localStorage.setItem(\'generated\', JSON.stringify(generated));console.log(num);```Remember that this code can only be executed in browser, since localStorage is a part of the Web Storage API meant solely for web browsers.If you are not bound to use JavaScript, you might want to consider another language that have persistent storage and randomness inbuilt or in case of JavaScript you can create a file stream for tracking generated numbers on server-side(Node.js) executions."},{"question":"I have a WordPress website.

So If someone tries to login then I need to approve that IP.Or is it a database problem?","answer":"This seems to be a rather unusual issue and can\'t be attributed to either a database problem or a security breach outright without more information. However, here are some possibilities:1. Plugin conflict: A potential source of the problem could be a plugin that is causing conflicts. If you’ve recently installed a new plugin, try to deactivate it and see if the problem persists.2. Themes: Sometimes, errors with the WordPress theme can also cause unusual problems. Check by switching to a default WordPress theme like Twenty Twenty and see if the issue persists.3. Malicious code: Hacked websites can behave unusually. Have a security scan run on your website to ensure no malicious code has been injected. You have WordFence but just to be sure, consider using other tools like Sucuri to scan your website.4. Database problem: It could be a database problem, such as tables getting corrupted. If this is the case, you can repair your database. WordPress allows you to repair your database directly from its dashboard (you just need to enable the feature in wp-config.php file).5. Server issues: This could potentially be a server problem. Some managed WordPress hosts (like WP Engine) have automated systems that might potentially change recent content. Contacting your hosting provider might be advisable.Also, check the logs for any unusual activity. If your website continues to have the same problem, even after all these checks, it might be best to seek professional help."}]'),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:q,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(i=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return i.question.toLowerCase().includes(e)||i.answer.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"search-container"},O={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],M={key:0},N={key:1};function F(i,e,l,u,o,s){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 AI effective tips collection 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",R,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),g(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,o.searchQuery]])]),t("div",O,[(a(!0),n(b,null,w(s.filteredPoems,(r,p)=>(a(),v(m,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:o.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...r)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...r))},[o.isLoading?(a(),n("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),n("span",M,"See more"))],8,E)):x("",!0)])}const L=h(D,[["render",F],["__scopeId","data-v-4e966228"]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/17.md","filePath":"quotes/17.md"}'),z={name:"quotes/17.md"},j=Object.assign(z,{setup(i){return(e,l)=>(a(),n("div",null,[T(L)]))}});export{H as __pageData,j as default};
