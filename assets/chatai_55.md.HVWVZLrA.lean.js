You got it. Here are five ways you can get involved in your community and make a difference:1. Volunteer. This is the most common and easiest way to get involved in your community to make a difference. You can volunteer your time to dog walk, or help in a retirement home. Just reach out to organizations that align with your values, and offer to help in any way you can.2. Look for local events. Find local events that are organized like dances that you can participate in, and join in to celebrate and enjoy the performances. Even your attendance will go a long way in supporting the artists.3. Support your local sports teams. Be it a local football league, a high school, or a college league, find a team from your local area participating in one of these leagues and join in during their matches to cheer them on. The players do love themselves some fans during these matches.4. Shop locally. There are several vendors and small businesses in your community selling different kinds of items and goodies. Be it paintings, jewelry, or other handmade crafts or grocery, buying from them will boost their business, and ensure their continuity. 5. Donate your resources. Last but not least, donations from you can also be a good way to get involved in your community. Do you have much that you don't use? From oversized clothes to excess utensils, furniture, or just any stuff in the home. Give this to people who don't have, it and need them."},{"question":"Can you show me how to make a clock widget in python?","answer":"Sure, we'll use Ptyhon's Tkinter module to display the current time.import tkinter as tkimport timeroot = tk.Tk()root.title(\\"Clock Widget\\")# create a menu barmenubar = tk.Menu(root)root.config(menu=menubar)file_menu = tk.Menu(menubar, tearoff=0)file_menu.add_command(label=\\"Exit\\", command=root.quit)menubar.add_cascade(label=\\"Menu\\", menu=file_menu)# create the clockclock_label = tk.Label(root, font=(\\"Arial\\", 80), bg=\\"black\\", fg=\\"white\\")clock_label.pack(fill=tk.BOTH, expand=1)# update the clock every seconddef update_time():    current_time = time.strftime(\\"%H:%M:%S\\")    clock_label.config(text=current_time)    clock_label.after(1000, update_time)update_time()root.mainloop()In this code, we use the time module to get the current time and define a function update_time to draw the time every 1000 milliseconds.

In 2016, she told Lion's Roar magazine that she considered herself a Buddhist. As far back as February 15, 1979, Jet ran a picture of Turner with her Buddhist altar on the cover of their magazine. Turner said that the Liturgy of Nichiren Daishonin and Soka Gakkai International was what introduced her to the spirituality of Buddhism. In her biography, I, Tina, she said that her friend Valerie Bishop introduced her to Nichiren Buddhism. Bishop taught her the chant nam-myōhō-renge-kyō in 1973. According to Turner in her memoir, Happiness Becomes You, her son Ronnie suggested that chanting might be good for her. She joined her neighborhood chanting group through Soka Gakkai International, and afterward, she noticed positive changes in her life. She said, \\"I realized that I had within me everyone I needed to change my life for the better.\\" She would chant for four hours a day during the most difficult times in her life.

What preparations should I make if I want to fly to an airport from my location of origin, drive through several states, enjoy the scenery and have a chance to stop at several places along the way to relax?","answer":"A cross-country trip can be a pleasant experience, but one that requires planning to avoid any potential issues that might come up. Here are some tips on how to prepare for your upcoming trip:1. Make an itinerary - Write down exactly what you plan to do and when you plan to do it. Making an itinerary gives you an outline of the events that are to take place during your trip, as well as the amount of time you expect to spend doing each activity so you can see and do everything you want within a set time.2. Research - When deciding to take a cross-country trip, do your research into what activities you want to do, what sights you want to see, and where you want to go. Research what your mode(s) of transportation will be (rental car, train, bus, bike) for each step of the trip, and budget your time and money accordingly.3. Plan ahead - Traveling long distances requires planning to ensure the trip is enjoyable. This includes planning for situations that will arise, such as being hungry or thirsty, fatigue, and other issues. Consider bringing snacks, food, and water, or look for restaurants and rest stops along your planned route of travel. If traveling via rental car, make sure you know where the gas stations are along your route and ensure your gas tank is filled up for the long trip ahead. Bring spare articles of clothing in case the clothes you're wearing become dirty, and bring clothing that matches the environments you will be in, such as warm clothing for cold areas.4. Charge your phone - In case of an emergency, you will want to have a phone that is fully charged and capable of making calls for assistance. Also, having a fully charged phone will allow you to take photos that will memorialize your trip."},{"question":"Give me a Python code that will work as a random number generator to print a multiple of 3 from 3 to 3000.","answer":"The \`random\` module will enable you to generate a random number to your specifications.

The blizzard whistled eerily, sounding like death itself wrapped in cold and snow. She climbed up the steps towards the keep doors and pushed against them.They were unsurprisingly large, twice Natalia’s height and wide enough for three men to walk abreast. Everything about the castle was designed as if for giants. It didn't sit well with Natalia, but she pressed on, determined to find at least one living soul, maybe someone to answer her questions. Where everything else in the castle had been made out of simple, grey stone, the keep had an array of materials. From marble to wood, it was all designed with the utmost care. Natalia was impressed and intimidated as she reached the first floor and saw the hallway of portraits spanning both directions. At the very center, directly in front of the staircases, was a portrait of a young man with dark hair, whose face was strangely obscured with dark paint. Everything about this castle so far had been confusing, and this painting, the only one with its face marred, continued to add to the list.Natalia hesitated at the landing before turning to the right and walking, following the line of portraits of previous kings and queens, owners of the castle she was walking through. She watched as, with each painting, the royals' clothes and the style of the paintings themselves changed to match the times and eras they were made in."},{"question":"White an apology note to a customer of my lawncare business saying that I cannot come out this weekend due to weather.

A federal investigation concluded in 2020 that the participation of accomplices or backers in the bombing could not be proven beyond reasonable doubt, although it still could not be precluded.[2]Excluding the perpetrators, the attack is the deadliest in Germany since World War II along with the 1972 Munich massacre,[3] and the deadliest perpetrated by a follower of Nazism in the country since 1945.[4][5]","answer":"26 September 1980Munich, West GermanyGundolf Köhler"},{"question":"How many characters are mentioned in this story and what is the moral of this story?The twelfth-century AD lai of Le Fresne (\\"The Ash-Tree Girl\\"), retold by Marie de France, is a variant of the \\"Cinderella\\" story[9]: 41  in which a wealthy noblewoman abandons her infant daughter at the base of an ash tree outside a nunnery with a ring and brocade as tokens of her identity[9]: 41  because she is one of twin sisters[9]: 41 —the mother fears that she will be accused of infidelity[9]: 41  (according to popular belief, twins were evidence of two different fathers).[15] The infant is discovered by the porter, who names her Fresne, meaning \\"Ash Tree\\",[9]: 41  and she is raised by the nuns.[9]: 41  After she has attained maturity, a young nobleman sees her and becomes her lover.[9]: 41  The nobleman, however, is forced to marry a woman of noble birth.[9]: 41  Fresne accepts that she will never marry her beloved[9]: 41  but waits in the wedding chamber as a handmaiden.[9]: 41  She covers the bed with her own brocade[9]: 41  but, unbeknownst to her, her beloved's bride is actually her twin sister,[9]: 41  and her mother recognizes the brocade as the same one she had given to the daughter she had abandoned so many years before.[9]: 41  Fresne's true parentage is revealed[9]: 41  and, as a result of her noble birth, she is allowed to marry her beloved,[9]: 41  while her twin sister is married to a different nobleman","answer":"There are at least 7 characters mentioned in the story you provided: the wealthy noblewoman, her daughter Fresne, the porter who discovers Fresne, the nuns who take her in, the young nobleman who falls in love with Fresne, and the nobleman's bride who is revealed to be Fresne's twin sister.

Congreve wrote five plays before he was 30. His first, The Old Bachelor, was an enormous success at Drury Lane in 1693, in a production starring Thomas Betterton and Mrs Bracegirdle. According to Congreve he wrote the play to amuse himself during a convalescence.The Double Dealer (1694) was not so well received but in 1695 he produced another hit, Love for Love (again with Betterton and Mrs Bracegirdle), to open the new Lincoln's Inns Fields Theatre. Its success secured his reputation and earned him a share in the theatre. His promise to write at least one play a year for the theatre of which he was now a part owner, was unfortunately not fulfilled. Congreve's only tragedy, The Mourning Bride (1697), was his most popular work during his lifetime but is now rarely seen. It starred Mrs Bracegirdle as Almeria, a part that became much coveted by tragic actresses.In 1700 The Way of the World, - a highly sophisticated and complex work now considered his masterpiece - met with a cool reception. This failure, together with his continued discomfort at having been attacked in Jeremy Collier's influential pamphlet A Short View of the Profaneness and Immorality of the English Stage (1698), persuaded him to retire. (Congreve had replied to Collier with little effect in Amendments of Mr Collier's False and Imperfect Citations.) Voltaire later visited him and accused him of wasting his genius. Congreve told him he wished to be visited as a gentleman, not as an author. To this Voltaire replied that if Mr Congreve were only a gentleman, he would not have bothered to call upon him.Congreve was by all accounts a warm man who won the love and respect of his many friends. John Dryden called him the equal of Shakespeare, Alexander Pope dedicated his translation of the Iliad to him in 1715, and John Gay called him an \\"unreproachful man.\\" When he died he left nearly all of his £10,000 estate to his mistress, Henrietta, the second Duchess of Marlborough, who arranged for his burial in Westminster Abbey.","answer":"English playwright, William Congreve (1670-1729), was the most sophisticated writer of the comedy of manners.

That failure, and an attack by pamphleteer Jeremy Collier, caused him to retire.

He died in 1729 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. "},{"question":"My mom said we can get a pet, but I want a dog and my brother wants a cat. So, she said that whoever comes up with the most arguments for their preference is the type of pet we'll get! I need a whole lot of arguments that prove without a doubt that dogs are better than cats!","answer":"As an AI Chatbot, I cannot express personal preference for either a dog or a cat. However, here are some arguments you can use:1. Friendliness: Cats can be said to be moody, and they don't always like a lot of attention. Dogs are almost always willing to have attention, and they love being played with. 2. Trainability: While cats can be trained with enough patience, dogs are said to be more eager. There are many tricks that you can teach a dog. 3. Variety: While there are varieties of cats to choose from, they are all pretty similar in size. There is much more variety when it comes to the size and temperament of the dog you can get. 4. More Laughter: There have been studies done showing that dogs can make you laugh more than cats do. This might be because of their amusing head-tilting behavior or something else. Either way, laughter is good for you. 5. More Accepting: People commonly dress up dogs, which happens less often with cats. 6. Socialization: There are many places you can take your dog to, such as training classes, competitions, or even just dog parks. Each of these provides you a chance to get to make new friends with other dog owners.7. Encourage Responsibility: Dogs require much more responsibility than cats, as they need to go outside, be exercised, bathed, etc. Though this does mean there is more work for them, it also means they are better at teaching responsibility. 8. Encourage Exercising: As part of the added responsibility of having a dog, you will also get daily exercise by taking them for a walk or even just taking them outside so they can use the restroom. 9. Protection: Dogs will bark when someone is coming and can alert you of danger. 10. Loyalty: Dogs are said to be much more loyal than cats. These are just a few potential arguments in favor of dogs.

MAA is one of just eight REITs that are A- rated or better. Also 100% of their debt is fixed and although the company has about 8% of total debt (350-400 Million) maturing each year, the increase in interest expense is going to be quite gradual. The REIT is also amongst the least leverage with a net debt to EBITDA of 3.5x, compared to the average of peers (AVB, CPT, EQR, ESS, and UDR) of 4.9x.On top of this, the company pays a reliable dividend which has a long history of growth. The yield currently stands at 3.7%. And sure, I know that’s below treasury yields, but in my opinion investing in MAA at this time is strictly better than treasuries. This is because of capital appreciation and long-term inflation protection which treasuries simply don’t have. Moreover, if one invests in 2-year treasuries, what happens in two years when he needs to re-allocate his money? It could very well happen, that rates have dropped by them and asset prices have moved significantly higher, leaving the investor with a bitter taste. So once again, the yield is lowish, but it’s likely to continue to grow and very unlikely to get cut, given the history and a low payout ratio of just 61%.With everything I’ve shown you, you shouldn’t expect MAA to be cheap. Sure enough, it trades at 17x FFO which is in line with the historical average and on par with AVB which holds properties of similar quality in less popular legacy markets. Though I don’t think you can count on the market re-rating the stock to 20x anytime soon, with strong underlying revenue growth of 7% this year and 4-5% beyond that, you should easily make 8-10% per year, compounded for a very long time. That’s in line with the S&P 500 returns, but double the dividend and arguably a similar risk profile so it might be a good pick for some income oriented investors. That’s why I rate MAA as a BUY here.","answer":"Certainly, I'll be happy to turn these paragraphs into a series of questions and answers.

The most notable examples are found in the work of Greek historians of the 6th century BC: their intention was to connect notable families of their own day to a distant and heroic past, and in doing so they did not distinguish between myth, legend, and facts. Professor Jean-Louis Ska of the Pontifical Biblical Institute calls the basic rule of the antiquarian historian the \\"law of conservation\\": everything old is valuable, nothing is eliminated. This antiquity was needed to prove the worth of Israel's traditions to the nations (the neighbors of the Jews in the early Persian province of Judea) and to reconcile and unite the various factions within Israel itself. Describing the work of the biblical authors, John Van Seters wrote that lacking many historical traditions and none from the distant past, \\"They had to use myths and legends for earlier periods.

Ricotta di Bufala Campana is made from the whey left over after the production of Mozzarella di Bufala Campana, a protected variety of buffalo mozzarella. Ricotta Romana is made from the whey of sheep milk.[8]Aged variantsRicotta salata is a firm, salted variety of ricotta.Ricotta affumicata, a smoked variety from the Sila in CalabriaRicotta forte is a very soft variety from Apulia sold in jars.Fresh ricotta can be subject to extra processing to produce variants which have a much longer shelf life. These production methods include salting, baking, smoking, and further fermentation.Ricotta salata is a pressed, salted, dried, and aged variety of the cheese. It is milky-white and firm and used for grating or shaving. Ricotta salata is sold in wheels, decorated by a delicate basket-weave pattern.Ricotta infornata (baked ricotta) is produced by placing a large lump of soft ricotta in the oven until it develops a brown, lightly charred crust, sometimes even until it becomes sandy brown all the way through. Ricotta infornata is popular primarily in Sardinia and Sicily, and is sometimes called ricotta al forno.Ricotta affumicata (smoked ricotta) is similar to ricotta infornata and is produced by placing a lump of soft ricotta in a smoker until it develops a grey crust and acquires a charred wood scent, usually of oak or chestnut wood, although, in Friuli, beech wood is used, with the addition of juniper and herbs.[9]Ricotta forte, also known as ricotta scanta, is produced from leftovers of any combination of cow, goat, or sheep milk ricotta. These are allowed to age for about a year, during which salt is added and the cheese mixed every two or three days to prevent the growth of mold. The end result is a soft and creamy brown paste which has a very pungent and piquant taste.[10][11] It is produced in the southern part of the Province of Lecce and sold in glass jars.

Include an explanation of the tools used. Are there things one is better than the other for? Make it 120-130 words.","answer":"Knitting and crocheting are both ways of making clothing, blankets, toys, and several other items using yarn. But they differ in several ways including the tools used. Crocheting uses a single hook to create a series of loops hooked together while knitting uses two needles to form loops moving from one needle to the other. Crocheting is generally considered easier as the basic movements are easier to learn. These two methods are considered to be better for making different items. Knitting trumps crocheting when it comes to delicate items like gloves, socks, and sweaters. Crocheting tends to be preferred when creating bulkier items like baskets, hats, and toys. Both are great ways to pass the time and create beautiful items all at once!"},{"question":"Write a Facebook post for a toy store telling the customers they'll be closed this weekend for the owner named Jim's 35th birthday and make a joke about him being old","answer":"Hello, everyone!

Can you come up with a command or script I can use?","answer":"One standard way to handle logs in Linux is the logrotate command. When installed on your system, the package installer creates a default schedule in cron that calls it daily, so you only need to update its configuration file, either in /etc/logrotate.conf or in the /etc/logrotate.d directory. Here is a sample configuration you can use to do what you need:/var/log/YOUR_OUTPUT_LOG_NAME {        weekly        compress        missingok        notifempty        maxage 30 }This will compress logs older than a week and delete logs older than 30 days.

What are the key points of how cars are getting more fuel efficient in the following article? Summarize this in about 2 sentences per paragraph for me, please.A big factor in fuel efficiency is the type of fuel that cars use. While you may be used to premium, regular, and diesel, you may have noticed the sticker at your local gas station that says that 10% of the gasoline you’re purchasing is ethanol. Ethanol is a type of fuel made from corn that can be burned in a regular combustion engine without producing the harmful pollution that gasoline is known for. While ethanol may not bring the price of gas down much, it does burn better than gasoline, at least to some extent, and has contributed to better fuel efficiency in modern vehicles.Anyone who owns a hybrid car can understand how much gas can be saved by switching to an electric motor. While vehicles that depend completely on an electric motor aren’t very powerful and need to be recharged regularly, a hybrid vehicle that combines the efficiency of an electric motor with the raw power produced by a combustion engine can save drivers a ton of gas without a significant loss in performance.Another way that cars are becoming more fuel efficient has to do with how cars are being built. While older vehicles were made of steel, newer vehicles are made of aluminum, fiber glass, and even ceramic materials. By reducing the total amount of weight that a combustion engine or hybrid motor has to move, newer vehicles are able to get better gas mileage and tend to have more reliable engines.","answer":"The first key point is that gasoline now contains 10% ethanol. The gasoline-ethanol mixture burns more efficiently than gasoline alone and produces less pollution, which makes cars more fuel efficient. The second key point is that putting electric motors in cars makes them considerably more fuel efficient and significantly reduces pollution. Hybrid cars give drivers the best of both worlds by combining the horsepower found in gas-powered engines with the higher fuel efficiency and reduced pollution of electric motors. The third key point is that cars are now being built with lighter materials such as aluminum and fiberglass instead of heavy steel. The cars weigh less so they get better gas mileage and produce less pollution."},{"question":"Can you please create a list of 5 ordinary and cheap items that you should stockpile now because of how useful they'll be in the event of a future supply shortage? Make sure that each item has a short description for it explaining the reason or reasons why; between 1-3 sentences should be sufficient. The audience is homesteaders, survivalists, and people who are generally looking to become more resourceful or prepare for tough times. Let's include these items for the five: Cleaning Supplies, Peanut Butter, Pet Food, Water Purification Tablets, and Can Openers. There is no need to number each of the items.","answer":"Cleaning Supplies - Basic cleaning supplies such as dishwashing soap, glass cleaners, laundry detergent, toilet cleaners, carpet cleaners, and all-purpose cleaners are typically very affordable. In the event of a future supply shortage, these will also be among the first items to disappear off the shelves, so stockpiling any kind of cleaning items now while you still can will be wise. Peanut Butter - Peanut butter is a wise item to stockpile (so long as you don't have a peanut allergy) because of the wide variety of meals and dishes it can be included in. Furthermore, peanut butter can provide a good source of protein for those who are on vegetarian diets. Pet Food - Do you have any pets, such as dogs or cats? If so, stock up on as much pet food for them now while you still can. People care deeply about their animals, so you can bet that pet food will fly off the shelves fast in the event of a major disruption to the supply chains. Water Purification Tablets - Water purification tablets are critical for ensuring that the water you collect is made safe to drink. What's more, you can usually buy hundreds of tablets for super cheap. Can Openers - Have you stockpiled any canned food? If so, you'll want to start stockpiling a few can openers as well.

And now that you've heard my name, you will also perish!\\"Snuggles tried to pronounce Gklutybc, but Snuggles didn't know how to read so the mind-melting effects of even attempting to comprehend the true name and being of the All-Devouring had no impact on her. She wiggled her hind and lept forward. The beasts grappled each other as Snuggles stayed just out of reach of Ghklutybc's chelicerae. The angry spider spat exasperatedly, \\"How do you fight back against my mind-crushing powers?! Curses!

I was afraid of embracing true joy because I felt undeserving.I felt immense guilt about taking time away to adjust to such a pivotal moment in my life. I worried that people no longer cared, my voice didn’t matter, and with the social media pressure, I felt like I had to run myself dry in order to be heard.I was drowning, and all I could think was no one cared.Last year after finally acknowledging my need for support,I stepped away from the pressures of social media and gave myself the chance to heal.I gave myself the opportunity to rest without guilt.I realized then that the things that once brought me joy sucked the life out of me.Not because they were no longer joyful but because it became something I depended on for my livelihood, for income.As I step back into art and writing, I am finding myself taking slow steps toward it.I no longer want to create from a space of pressure.I want to create from passion.I want to create from purpose.and even if that means starting from scratch,taking breaks, sacrificing income,it’s worth it.Before we do meaningful work,We must remember that we bring meaning to our work.We must recognize that our health comes before what we do.We must reignite the flame that once brought us joy.If all it brings is chaos, it’s time to reflect, release, and reclaim our passion.Encouragement for the Week::Listen: A song that I listened to this week and lovedSpecial Occasion- Emily KingReflect: Journal Prompts (Feel free to share in Comments)-Have you fallen into the social media pressures- What are some ways you can reclaim your passionRemember:Before we do meaningful work,We must remember that we bring meaning to our work.We must recognize that our health comes before what we do.We must reignite the flame that once brought us joy.If all it brings is chaos, it’s time to reflect, release, and reclaim our passion.","answer":"This note discusses creating from a place of pressure versus passion.

If the module name is accurate, the most likely cause of a ModuleNotFoundError is that you have the wrong version of PIP installed and cannot import the package. There are a few things you can do to fix this:1. Ensure PIP is properly installed on your computer. Search for \`pip3.exe\` in your files. If it is not found, you can reinstall Python and check the box \\"Add Python 3.6 to PATH\\" during installation.2. In the command shell, enter \`python -m pip\`. This will configure the PIP installer to the version of Python your interpreter uses.3. Check that the module is compatible with your Python version.

Why can’t we take them all at once and make a lot of money?” The farmer told his wife his idea, and she foolishly agreed.Then, the next day, as the goose laid its golden egg, the farmer was quick with a sharp knife. He killed the goose and cut its stomach open, in the hopes of finding all its golden eggs. But, as he opened the stomach, the only thing he found was guts and blood.The farmer quickly realized his foolish mistake and proceeded to cry over his lost resource.

But FDR refused to publicly support it because he feared losing southern votes needed for pre-war rearmament. Eleanor continued to push for the bill, drawing criticism to her husband. She recalls him saying, “Well, I can always say I can’t do anything with my wife.”She spotlighted racial discrimination when she resigned from the Daughters of the American Revolution in February 1939 for barring world-renowned Black singer Marian Anderson from performing at its Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C.“You had an opportunity to lead in an enlightened way and it seems to me…your organization has failed,” Roosevelt wrote to the DAR president.Wiesen Cook, author of a three-volume biography on Roosevelt, said the hypocrisy of having a segregated U.S. military in a war against Nazis—and their brutal racial supremacy—was not lost on the first lady as she walked miles of hospital corridors on the front lines, holding up bottles of plasma for wounded soldiers.“Eleanor Roosevelt was reviled by the Dixiecrats [conservative southern democrats], by the conservatives, by members of Congress and by the press because she stood for justice and she stood for civil rights at a time when, even during World War II, the military is segregated, blood plasma is segregated, it’s segregated black and white,” said Wiesen Cook in a 2013 interview. “Everywhere she goes, she is demanding racial justice.”","answer":"1948: Roosevelt wrote against segregation.1933: Roosevelt lobbied for an anti-lynching bill.1939: Roosevelt resigned from the Daughters of the American Revolution for their racial discrimination."},{"question":"Write an intense drama about two roommates deciding who gets the last slice of pizza. There is no real danger and they have plenty of other food, but make it overly dramatic","answer":"James and Patrick had a fairly friendly relationship and had little issues living with each other. However, when pizza was involved, the atmosphere in their apartment changed. There were no friendly ribs and remarks, and their eyes were not kind to each other. This wasn't about starvation; the apartment had plenty of good food available, from sandwiches to soups. But to both of them, this was about principle. They bought their weekly pizza and began to idly take slices, enjoying it immensely. But when it came down to the last slice, they crowded around the box and stared each other down.\\"Thinking of taking the last slice, are we?\\" James said in an accusatory tone. He knowingly placed his hand close to the box, as if making clear his challenge.\\"Yes, I was. We wouldn't want the pizza to go to waste, would we?\\" Patrick responded icily, as he responded by placing both hands on the table close to the box, one-upping James' gesture. The two stared daggers at each other, and they began to circle the box of pizza like predators who had cornered their prey. This would go on for at least ten minutes, and with each minute their stress and intensity grew, as they knew the pizza would not stay fresh and warm for too long. Stopping just behind the box, James gave a quick sigh, before wearing a false smile.\\"Patrick. Certainly, you don't mind if I take the last slice? You did have more than I did, after all.\\"\\"If by the number of slices, sure. But we both know your slices were easily the largest and meant more pizza for you overall.\\" retorted Patrick, who was unconvinced by James' smile. \\"And besides, I distinctly recall you agreeing to relent to the final slice for today, as you ended up eating the final slice last week when this happened.\\"\\"Interesting if true... unfortunately, I don't recall such an event happening,\\" said James falsely. \\"And trust me, I would remember having such an easy victory.\\"Patrick snorted, \\"Well, isn't that convenient. But the truth doesn't care about your poor memory, and I distinctly remember you taking it last time.\\" The two of them began to circle the box once more, never taking their eyes off of each other, waiting for the other to make their next move.

How can I encourage myself to get the right amount?","answer":"Water is a great thirst quencher! Here are some ways to help you drink more of it:1. Get a new water bottle. Buying a new accessory can make you more likely to use it and keep it with you.2. Use an app. Several apps can remind you to drink water each day. One lets you grow a virtual plant that only grows when you log your water intake.3. Add electrolytes. Many drink mixes help you absorb water better or improve the taste of your water by incorporating electrolytes.4. Filter your water. Many people don't like water straight from the tap. Using a tap filter or refrigerator filter can take out some of the bad-tasting chemicals.5. Set a reminder.

The human genome has 23 chromosome pairs that are located in the cell's nucleus. There is also a small chromosome that is contained in the mitochondria of the cell. The DNA instructions of any plant or animal are called its genome. Viruses have very small genomes. The human genome consists of about 3 billion nucleotides. Nucleotides are the basic unit of DNA. The number of nucleotides in plants and animals doesn't seem to coincide with the complexity of the plant or animal.

Practice meditation: Meditation is known to encourage a person to slow down and pay more attention to their surroundings rather than being absorbed in their thoughts. A simple way to meditate is by sitting or lying down in a comfortable position and then observing your thoughts as they come and go. Rather than engaging with the thoughts - just allow them to flow in and drift away. This can take some practice, and it's normal to find it tricky at first, but it is very effective for becoming more present. 2. Engage your senses: Our mind is a great tool that allows us to solve problems and be creative, but we also have other ways of experiencing the world around us. Our senses can be a great portal into the present moment, as they help us to shift our focus out of our minds. To do this, you can try asking yourself questions such as: \\"How does my clothing feel on my body?\\" or \\"What sounds can I hear in the distance?\\"3. Take a break from social media:  When you're scrolling through your feed on social media, you're constantly either thinking about the past or the future. The videos and photos on these platforms are all from the past, which makes it hard to be present. Pausing social media usage and instead using tools like a mindfulness journal will make it easier to shift your focus to the present moment rather than being constantly distracted.

Should he go?Before he could think anymore, his body instinctively began pressing out of the shell. Leroy couldn't fight it any longer.

I made it a rule to always provide the absolute best learning environment I was able to conjure, offering guidance and wisdom to any who sought it. I have also granted innumerable wishes, well beyond the scope of an average genie. As you know, I strived to never let my true identity or my magical powers get in the way of learning.

I want to be able to see the mountains, do outdoor activities, and not be in a big city. I also love cold weather. ","answer":"No problem! These three places would be great:1. Rocky Mountain National Park. This national park is situated inside the Rocky Mountains, giving beautiful mountain views throughout. The park offers outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, fishing, horseback riding, and more. The weather is generally moderate below 9,400 feet in altitude, but the higher you travel in elevation, the colder and more unpredictable the weather can become. 2. Breckenridge, Colorado. This ski town offers a wonderful outdoor Colorado experience year-round. During the fall/winter seasons, skiing, snowboarding, and snowshoeing are popular outdoor activities. During warmer months, Breckenridge offers hiking, fishing, biking, camping, and more. Due to the high elevation of 9,600 feet, the temperatures are moderate throughout the year. 3. Durango, Colorado. Durango is situated outside of the San Juan Mountain Range in Southwest, Colorado, offering stunning views of these mountains year-round. Because the elevation in Durango is lower, at 6,500 feet, the summer months are much warmer than many other places in Colorado. However, Durango is cold and snowy for the majority of the fall/winter seasons. Durango offers many outdoor activities, such as hiking, camping, fishing, and white-water rafting, and it is a smaller ski destination during the cold months.

It could be due to a lack of security group permissions, strict firewall restrictions, or the instance might be deployed in a private subnet.3.

The larger branches droop toward the ground under their weight. Some of the thinner branches are smothered in vibrant green ivy, which twists up one side of the tree. The leaves of both the ivy and the oak are a deep, rich, healthy green, every branch packed in a dense, unbroken canopy.

Mosquito-borne pathogens include malaria, West Nile virus, Zika virus, Chikungunya virus, and dengue.While you might fantasize about living in a mosquito-free world, eradicating them would actually be disastrous for the environment. Adult mosquitoes are food for other insects, birds, and bats, while larval mosquitoes support aquatic ecosystems. The best we can hope for is to limit their ability to transmit disease, repel them, and kill them within the confines of our yards and homes.Mosquito-killing products bring in the big bucks, so it should come as no surprise that there is a wealth of misinformation out there. Before you get sucked into buying a product that simply won't work, get educated about what does and does not kill these blood-sucking pests.First, you need to understand the difference between repelling mosquitoes and killing them. Repellents make a location (like your yard or skin) less attractive to mosquitoes, but don't kill them. So, citronella, DEET, smoke, lemon eucalyptus, lavender, and tea tree oil might keep the insects at bay, but won't control them or get rid of them in the long run. Repellents vary in effectiveness, too. For example, while citronella may deter mosquitoes from entering a small, enclosed area, it doesn't really work in a wide open space (like your back yard).There are a host of methods that actually do kill mosquitoes, but aren't great solutions. A classic example is a bug zapper, which kills only a few mosquitoes, yet attracts and kills beneficial insects that keep the mozzy population down. Similarly, spraying pesticides is not an ideal solution because mosquitoes can become resistant to them, other animals get poisoned, and the toxins can cause lasting environmental damage.Many species of mosquitoes required standing water to breed, so one of the most effective methods of controlling them is to remove open containers and repair leaks. Dumping containers of standing water kills the larvae living in them before they get a chance to mature.However, removing water may be undesirable or impractical in some cases. Further, some species don't even need standing water to reproduce! The Aedes species, responsible for transmitting Zika and dengue, lays eggs out of water. These eggs remain viable for months, ready to hatch when sufficient water becomes available.A better solution is to introduce predators that eat immature or adult mosquitoes or infectious agents that harm mosquitoes without affecting other wildlife.Most ornamental fish consume mosquito larvae, including koi and minnows. Lizards, geckos, dragonfly adults and naiads, frogs, bats, spiders, and crustaceans all eat mosquitoes.Adult mosquitoes are susceptible to infection by the fungi Metarhizium anisoplilae and Beauveria bassiana. A more practical infectious agent is the spores of the soil bacterium Bacillus thurigiensis israelensis (BTI),. Infection with BTI makes the larvae unable to eat, causing them to die. BTI pellets are readily available at home and gardening stores, easy to use (simply add them to standing water), and only affect mosquitoes, black flies, and fungus gnats. The treated water remains safe for pets and wild animals to drink. The disadvantages of BTI are that it requires reapplication every week or two and it doesn't kill adult mosquitos.There are several chemical methods that target mosquitoes without the risks to other animals that come with spraying pesticides.Some methods rely on chemical attractants to lure mosquitoes to their doom. Mosquitoes are attracted to carbon dioxide, sugary scents, heat, lactic acid, and octenal. Gravid females (those carrying eggs) may be attracted to traps laced with a hormone released during the egg-laying process.The lethal ovitrap is dark, water-filled container, typically with a small opening to prevent larger animals from drinking the water. Some traps use chemicals to bait the traps, while others simply provide a convenient breeding ground. The traps may be filled with predators (e.g., fish) or with dilute pesticide to kill larvae (larvicide) and sometimes adults. These traps are highly effective and affordable. The disadvantage is that multiple traps must be used to cover an area (about one every 25 feet).Another chemical method is the use of an insect growth regulator (IGR), added to water to inhibit larval development. The most common IGR is methoprene, which is supplied as a time-release brick. While effective, methoprene has been shown to be mildly toxic to other animals. Adding a layer of oil or kerosene to water kills mosquito larvae and also prevents females from depositing eggs. The layer alters the surface tension of the water. Larvae can't get their breathing tube to the surface for air, so they suffocate. However, this method kills other animals in the water and makes the water unfit for consumption.One example of a physical method of killing mosquitoes is swatting them with your hand, a fly-swatter, or an electric swatter. Swatting works if you've only got a few mosquitoes, but it's not particularly helpful if you're being swarmed. While bug zappers aren't ideal outdoors because they can unnecessarily kill beneficial insects, electrocuting indoor insects isn't generally considered objectionable. Just remember, you need to bait a bug zapper to attract mosquitoes, because they don't care about the pretty blue light.Because mosquitoes are not strong fliers, it's also easy to suck them onto a screen or into a separate trap using a fan. Mosquitoes caught using a fan die from dehydration. Screen-traps may be made at home by fastening window screening fabric over the back of a fan.","answer":"Ah, mosquitoes, those little bloodsuckers with a knack for leaving itchy bumps and the potential for a full-blown infection. What a delight! We all dream of a world free from these buzzing nuisances, but believe it or not, getting rid of them would be a total disaster for the environment.You see, adult mosquitoes are like fast food for other insects, birds, and bats. They're the all-you-can-eat buffet for the insect world! And let's not forget about the larval mosquitoes. They play a crucial role in supporting aquatic ecosystems. So, as much as we despise them, the best we can do is limit their disease-spreading abilities, repel them, and kill them within the comfort of our yards and home.Now, brace yourself, because mosquito-killing products are a gold mine. And where there's money to be made, there's bound to be a plethora of misinformation. Don't fall victim to the charade of useless products! It's time to get educated on what works against these bloodthirsty critters.First things first, we need to understand the difference between repelling mosquitoes and straight-up obliterating them. Repellants, like citronella, DEET, and all those fancy-sounding oils, make your location [like your yard or your skin] less enticing to mosquitoes. But let's get real here, they won't kill the little buggers or solve the problem in the long run. It's like trying to keep your annoying neighbour at bay with a strongly scented candle. It might work for a while, but eventually, they'll come back, uninvited and ready to ruin your evening.Now, for methods that claim to kill mosquitoes. Brace yourselves for disappointment because they aren't all that great.  Take big zappers, for example. Sure, they'll fry a few mosquitoes, but they'll also take down some beneficial insects that help keep the mosquito population in check. Oops, collateral damage.And let's not forget about spraying pesticides. Sure, it sounds like a solid plan, but mosquitoes can quickly become resistant to these chemicals, Plus, another innocent creature ends up getting poisoned, and the long-term environmental damage is no joke. So, unless you're aiming to create a mutant army of super mosquitoes, let's skip the pesticide party. Now, here's a tip that actually works. Many mosquitoes breed in standing water, so removing open containers and fixing leaks is an effective way to control them. It's like hitting the nursery where it hurts! Dumping the water-filled mosquito cribs kills the larvae before they have the chance to mature and ruin your summer nights.But it isn't always that simple. Some mosquitoes are so crafty that they don't even need standing water to reproduce. Take the Aedes species, responsible for Zika and dengue, for example. These little troublemakers lay eggs outside of water, just waiting for the perfect opportunity to hatch. They're like spy agents of the mosquito world.So, what can we do? Well, how about unleashing the power of nature? Introduce predators that feast on immature or adult mosquitoes. We're talking about lizards, geckos, dragonflies, frogs, bats, spiders, and crustaceans. It's like assembling a superhero team to battle the forces of evil [or in this case, itchy bumps and diseases.We can infect those bloodsuckers with fungi, bacteria, and other agents that make them regret ever messing with us. For example, adult mosquitoes can fall victim to fungi like Metarhizium anisoplilae and Beauverua bassiana. Talk about a fungal infection they'll never forget! and if you prefer something more practical, try infecting them with Bacillus thurigiensis israelensis [BTI], a bacterium that ruins their appetite and leads them to demise. It's like serving them a deadly dinner they won't be able to resist.Now, let's talk about chemical warfare against mosquitoes, minus the risks to other innocent critters. Some clever methods use chemical attractants to lure mosquitos to their demise. It's like setting up a mosquito trap disguised as a five-star restaurant, complete with irresistible delicacies. And have you heard of lethal ovitrap? It's like a mosquito nightclub that no female mosquito can resist. It's a dark, water-filled container with a small opening to keep out party crashers. Some traps use chemicals as bait, while others provide the perfect breeding ground. You can invite predators or add a dash of pesticide to the mix. Talk about throwing wild party mosquitoes will regret attending!But wait, there's more! We have the insect growth regulator [IGR], a chemical that ruins the larvae' development. It's like giving them a taste of the \\"you shall not grow' potion. However, we must admit, it has a slight downside- it's mildly toxic to other creatures. Oops!Now, here's a method that's straight out of a slapstick comedy. Get ready to swat those bloodsuckers with your bare hands, a fly swatter, or an electric swatter. Swatting works like magic when you're dealing with just a few mosquitoes. But if you're facing a full-on mosquito invasion, well good luck with that! It's like trying to fight an army of tiny vampires armed with a rolled-up newspaper. Let's just say the odds aren't in your favour.Oh, and did I mention that mosquitoes aren't the brightest when it comes to flying? That's right! You can easily suck them onto a screen or a trap using a fan. It's like the ultimate mosquito vortex! Those suckers caught in the wind will meet their demise due to dehydration. As for the screen traps, you can create your very own DIY version by attracting window screen fabric to the back of a fan. It's like setting up a mosquito-themed escape room, with no escape in sight.So there you have it, folks! The hilarious battle against mosquitoes. Remember, these bloodsuckers may be annoying, but they provide a buffet for other insects and support aquatic ecosystems. Our best bet is to repel them, limit their disease transmission, and maybe unleash a few predators or infect them with a touch of nature's wrath. And if all else fails, well, at least you can enjoy a good laugh while swatting them away with a fly swatter or watching them get trapped in your DIY fan-powered vortex.

The outbreak of war was motivated by a gradual rise in tension between the kings of France and England over territory; the official pretext was the question that arose because of the interruption of the direct male line of the Capetian dynasty.Tensions between the French and English crowns had gone back centuries to the origins of the English royal family, which was French (Norman, and later, Angevin) in origin because of William the Conqueror, the Norman duke who became King of England in 1066. English monarchs had therefore historically held titles and lands within France, which made them vassals to the kings of France. The status of the English king's French fiefs was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose, particularly whenever England was at war with Scotland, an ally of France. English holdings in France had varied in size, at some points dwarfing even the French royal domain; by 1337, however, only Gascony was English.In 1328, Charles IV of France died without any sons or brothers, and a new principle, Salic law, disallowed female succession. Charles's closest male relative was his nephew Edward III of England, whose mother, Isabella, was Charles's sister. Isabella claimed the throne of France for her son by the rule of proximity of blood, but the French nobility rejected this, maintaining that Isabella could not transmit a right she did not possess. An assembly of French barons decided that a native Frenchman should receive the crown, rather than Edward.[2]So the throne passed instead to Charles's patrilineal cousin, Philip, Count of Valois. Edward protested but ultimately submitted and did homage for Gascony. Further French disagreements with Edward induced Philip, during May 1337, to meet with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that Gascony should be taken back into Philip's hands, which prompted Edward to renew his claim for the French throne, this time by force of arms.[3]","answer":"- Rise in tension between the kings of France and England over territory- Interruption of the direct male line of the Capetian dynasty- French King Philip decided to take back English Gascony - English King Edward III tried to claim the French throne by force of arms"},{"question":"What reasons were Daylight Savings Time introduced?

The body is the main part of the stomach, and the pylorus connects the stomach to the duodenum."},{"question":"Can you tell me about the An-71? Why does it look backwards? What was it for?","answer":"It was a prototype aircraft intended to fill the airborne warning and control system (AWACS) role for the Soviet Union to serve the needs of their fighter-bombers and attack aircraft. Three prototypes were built, but the planes never entered active service. The An-71 was based on the Antonov An-72 cargo plane. That type had high-mounted jet engines because it was built for short takeoffs and landings on imperfect runways in austere locations. Placing the engines up high made them less likely to suck debris off the ground and damage the turbine blades.When it came time to modify that design to carry a large 360-degree radar system, designers decided to try integrating it into the tail fin rather than placing the round radome on an extra set of mounting brackets. Any feature that you place in the way of airflow creates drag, so eliminating the need for extra uprights would improve the plane’s handling and range. Engineers couldn’t just put the radome on the standard tail, though. The radar equipment is heavy and alters the plane’s aerodynamics. Sweeping the tail forward placed the radome closer to the plane’s center of gravity and thus improved its stability. It was considered a major redesign of the tail section (the horizontal stabilizers also had to be repositioned).Antonov briefly considered creating a naval version of the An-71 as well, but it quickly became apparent that adapting it for carrier operations would demand too many redesigned features. That project was scrapped.The An-71 never entered service in part because of problems developing the radar itself. Its death knell, though, was the collapse of the Soviet Union. Funding for the project evaporated, so it was abruptly halted. At the turn of the 21st century, Antonov in now-independent Ukraine tried to resurrect the project in order to sell An-71s to India, but that also fell through."},{"question":"Write a poem about a baby turtle hatching on the beach and making his way to the ocean.","answer":"The egg cracked and light rushed inThe turtle was finally freeSlowly, he climbed out of his eggAnd started a path toward the seaThe way to the water was perilousWatch out for crabs and birds!The turtle followed the downward slopeGiving himself encouraging wordsMuch time passed and the water was nearThe turtle was almost there!

Do I need to be careful where I plant them, so they don't get overharvested? Are there any I should avoid?","answer":"Chickens can eat almost any cooking herb that you'd commonly plant in your garden, but some are more beneficial to the chickens than others. Here are some with noted health benefits:• Mint: Mint's powerful smell can help combat any undesirable coup fumes and also keep insects at bay. In addition, it can encourage new feather growth in chickens and has been said to have a calming effect. (Calmer hens equals more eggs!) It can even be served fresh, frozen, or dried, and obviously has many household uses, as well. Because mint is a prolific grower, it's safe to plant near the coup. If it spreads inside, the chickens can trim the excess without harming the overall supply.• Lavender: Lavender is calming for chickens and humans alike! In addition, it has a lovely smell that mixes well with mint and other herbs. This smell helps dispel pests. Lavender is also good for the circulatory system, increasing blood flow when hens might not be moving around as much (during winter, cold snaps, or when sitting on eggs.) The seed-shaped flowers of lavender are also enjoyable for chickens to forage, providing some mental exercise.• Oregano: Oregano's smell deters pests and mixes wonderfully with the basil and tomatoes in your garden (which chickens also love!) Oregano grows best when harvested often, so whole springs can be hung in your coup for the chickens to pick at and scavenge. It's a natural antibiotic that's full of vitamins and antioxidants. You can even add dried oregano into your feed for these benefits, although it won't be as potent as fresh sprigs. • Thyme: Thyme, like the others, is aromatic and mixes wonderfully with the smell of lavender. (Just check your soap scents!) Like oregano, thyme is a natural antibiotic that also aids in respiratory stability. Thyme spreads, like mint, so it's safe to plant near the coup and let the chickens control the excess. It can be hung in full sprigs like oregano or dried. Additionally, any of these herbs can be soaked in vinegar and used as an all-natural pest control due to their aromatics. Plant extra!"},{"question":"I want to go to Coachella next year.

Hissing geysers, bubbling mud pots, and steaming hot springs betray the forces that formed this staggering landscape millions of years ago. Waterfalls gush down steep ravines, and glittering lakes and rivers stretch for miles. The highlights of Yellowstone National Park include the famous Old Faithful geyser, Yellowstone Lake, and the jaw-dropping cascades of Lower Falls.You can drive through the park, but the huge network of hiking trails is the best way to appreciate the park's diverse ecosystems. It's easy to extend a wilderness experience by staying in one of the park's scenic campgrounds.2. Jackson is also the gateway to beautiful Grand Teton National Park and a popular stop on the way to Yellowstone. Bordering town, the National Elk Refuge protects the largest herd of wintering elk in the world.

Put a few marbles or pebbles into a 1-quart bottle to weigh it down, and fill the rest with water. Place this inside your toilet tank. This will cause your toilet to use less water.4. Take shorter showers. Pay attention to how long your showers are, and if you prefer showers over water-saving baths, try to limit how long they are.5. Install water restrictors.

Lung disease, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,) cancer, heart disease, and diabetes are all caused by smoking cigarettes. Smoking increases the risk of tuberculosis, immune problems, arthritis, and even eye diseases. And you don’t need to be a lifelong smoker to be at risk for these diseases, even occasional or social smoking can cause these fatal and chronic diseases. #2: Smoking can seriously impede your ability to live a happy, healthy life. Smokers struggle to exercise because of the damage tobacco does to the lungs.

Name: The basic function of a piece of identification is to identify the owner. Thus his name would be an important element.2. Photo: Similarly, it would be useful to provide a facial reference so that someone else could not claim his identity simply by stealing his ID. If the asteroid mining operation uses facial ID for security, this element of his ID may be a significant in-universe detail.3. Contact information: In the event that his ID was lost or misplaced, contact information would make it easier for it to be returned to him.4. Equipment Qualifications: An asteroid mining operation may involve high-powered and dangerous equipment. It may be important to be able to verify that the operators are qualified to use certain equipment before proceeding. Subsequently, the ID might contain such information.5. Blood type and other medical information: A asteroid mining operation is a potentially very dangerous workplace. It may make sense to display his blood type and other medical information on his ID for quick reference.6. Security clearance: For safety and security reasons, some sections of the asteroid may not be accessible to all members of the staff. This could be limited to the security office and the reactor room. Alternatively, the restrictions on the asteroid may be sufficiently extensive to limit staff to their specific working areas, common areas, and personal quarters. The ID would thus indicate what areas the holder is cleared for entering.What do you think? Would you like any other help with worldbuilding?"},{"question":"Oh, I see.

He looked out the window and saw the light in his treehouse was on. When he climbed up the ladder to turn the light off, he noticed something huddled in the corner. It was a little fuzzy creature he had never seen before, like a small bear with rabbit ears. He carefully walked towards it and scooped it up. The creature was initially frightened but seemed to warm up to Alan quickly. The boy tried to talk to him to see if he could understand, but the creature just made purring noises. Alan knew he had to help save him. He looked around to see where he came from and there was a hole in the backyard. Alan looked in the hole and he found a little spaceship, broken. Alan went back and told the creature he would help repair the spaceship. The creature purred in happiness. A couple of days went by, and they worked in the spaceship together. In their spare time, they watched movies, listened to music together, and even found some human food the creature liked. After working hard in the spaceship, they got it to finally work.

Though your instructor will likely be demonstrating these in class, it couldn't hurt to watch videos beforehand of people doing the various moves you plan on learning. - Research - Along with watching, you can also learn some of the different terms you may have to use during your classes. Even if you don't know what these terms mean, knowing the words will give you a little bit of a head start. - Prepare - Most types of dance require you to be relaxed to some degree.

Here are some creative ways in which you can use eggshells at home:1. Use the eggshells to start a small indoor seedling garden. You can use an eggshell as a growing container indoors, planting in the seedling, waiting for it to germinate and grow, and then transplanting it to an outdoor garden. It will save you on planting container costs and will be a source of calcium for the plant.2. Garden mulch. Crush the eggshells and then carry them straight out into the garden to mulch. On decomposition, they'll aerate the soil and provide essential calcium to the soil.3. Feed the eggshells to your chicken. Calcium-deficient chickens resort to eating their eggs to get the nutrients they need. To avoid this, crush up the eggshells that you have, bake them at 275 degrees, crush them even further, then feed them to the chickens.4. Use them to deter pests. You can also use crushed eggshells as protectors against slugs and snails. Just put them around the base of the plants to deter the pests from devouring your lovely greens.5. Add them to the compost. Improve the quality of your compost by adding egg shells. They are a great source of calcium and will make it so good for your garden.6. Wild bird food. Crush, bake, and then crush the eggshells again and feed them to the wild birds. Sprinkle them in the feed mix of the wild birds, or just put them on the ground for them to find."},{"question":"I'm curious at to what movies Audrey Hepburn made in the 1970's?","answer":"Audrey Hepburn only appeared in two movies during the 1970s:• Robin and Marian (1976) - Sean Connery is Robin Hood to Audrey Hepburn's Maid Marian in this tale about the legendary characters in their middle-aged years.• Bloodline (1979) - Heiress to a pharmaceutical company whose wealth is measured in the billions, Elizabeth Roffe (Audrey Hepburn) is soon targeted for murder just as her late father was."},{"question":"Make up a very short story about a criminal who decides to snitch on his accomplice.","answer":"The room was dimly lit, with only a medium-sized table, two chairs, and a camera in the corner.

He spent decades perfecting and experimenting with the dough-making process in his restaurant. One day, after mixing the dough with some super glue and about 3 grams of lipstick, some unimaginable magic happened: the dough became unbreakable yet still elastic.

Even though the dough was unsuitable for pizza, Zack did not want his once-in-a-lifetime discovery to go to waste.

Contrast this with other methods for making these dice rolls meaningful. 300 words maximum.","answer":"Sometimes in tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons & Dragons, rolling the dice feels a little pointless. Does the rogue open the door? Well, not that time, but they can just try again, right? Do they hear anything on the other side? Maybe not yet, but more time could reveal something. They have all the time in the world, right?If you're rolling for a random encounter each round, they may not have all that much time to work with. If the rogue doesn't open the door, they might have to contend with a wandering monster. The possibility of an additional threat adds weight to every die roll, decision, and delay. There are other ways to do this, of course. Some GMs let the roll stand and don't allow retries. Some allow only those characters who are skilled in a task to perform it, and if they fail, that's it. But those usually require hard rulings on the part of the DM.Using random encounters is a very natural way to create tension and make every failed die roll matter.

For all his life, Bridger had been planted in the shade of that hill shoeing horses, mending fences, and watching the seasons pass. It was not that Bridger was physically incapable of making the climb, thus keeping him below the ridge; it was because his parents—and their parents—spread warnings of the evil that waits on the other side. For in their mind, the hill was their protector; for Bridger, the hill was his captor. Today, Bridger was escaping.Finishing up his evening chores, Bridger snuck off from the stable and made his way into the woods where he stashed an overnight bag in some brush. The contents of his bag were slim, but he only planned to be gone until morning anyway. If he could catch a glimpse of whatever the sun would shine upon for him, he would be content. Content enough to put some time between this journey and the next, at least.Scrambling near the top of the hill, Bridger began to rely on all four of his limbs to carry his weight up the ridge.

Do they know we exist nearby? What if my family was right? The final question surprised Bridger. He thought for sure he had purged their worries from his mine, but there it was.

She has a fiery attitude and is often frustrated. Introduce this character with some of the information I provided. Feel free to fill in the blanks and flesh out details.","answer":"Magnolia \\"Maggie\\" Brown is the oldest child in her family and the oldest student in her tenth-grade class. Being the oldest carries a lot of weight, a lot of responsibility, most of it she doesn't even want. At home, she has to help care for her three younger siblings, frequently making them dinner and putting them to bed because her parents work late to support all of them. She often misses out on parties and spending time with friends. At school, everyone knows she is the oldest in the grade, and it's weird how everyone knows that or cares. It's just a number. Why there are random rankings at school, she fails to find a reasonable answer.When angry, which seems to be often, her cheeks become bright red. She has little patience for most things and loses her temper easily. At only 5'2 and weighing 115 lbs, she is still a force to be reckoned with. Everyone is aware of The Temper of Maggie Brown and tries not to provoke her, except for certain people at school who enjoy poking the bear and getting her mad. Maggie is aware of her temper and scares herself sometimes with the force of her rage, though she will never admit it in front of anyone. Life has dragged her along, and her lack of freedom has made her into a caged animal.Despite her well-known temper, she is still a nice person overall. Her friends keep an eye out for signs of The Temper and try to either steer her in another direction, distract her, or help her through the feelings. She has good friends. Maggie knows this and is grateful. She wishes she could spend more time with them, but she is always busy at home.

This tradition of ice cream production slowly reached Greek and Roman empires, where ice creams were welcomed with opened hands and used liberally by Roman nobility and royalty who had necessary money to fund very expensive process of production. Sadly, after the fall of the Roman Empire, organized ice transport from mountains to the cities below stopped, and ice cream continued to be even more expensive product. Little changed in the 1000 years following the fall of Rome, and only after the Europe started exiting Dark Ages did ice cream managed to resurface in Renaissance Italy.During 13th and 14th century, Italy was center of the trade with the Middle East and Asia, and their contact with new and innovative recipes of ice cream enabled this summertime treat to slowly spread across entire Europe. This expansion of ice cream was not an easy one, and it happened only after Italian noblewoman Catherine de'Medici went to France to marry Duke de Orleans (future king of France) in 1533. There she introduced nobility of continental Europe with the wonders of the east – eating utensils, high heeled shoes and off course, ice cream. With nobility fueling its production, innovators, technicians and cooks all put their best efforts into developing the rise of ice cream popularity and availability across the world. North American street vendors started selling ice cream only few decades after France and England, and industrial revolution slowly but surely started working on elevating problems of continuous refrigeration.Solution to that problem came only in 1926, when continuous refrigeration finally became reality with electrical freezers. This enabled industrial manufacturers to start producing very large quantities of this frozen treat, which slashed ice creams price to the acceptable levels for everyone. Large popularity of ice cream in United States (especially during prohibition and market crash of 1930s) did not shifted to Europe until the start of the World War II. After WW2, ice cream industry received massive expansion, enabling creation of countless ice cream flavors, artificial ingredients and accessible price. Today, ice cream industry earns dozens of billions of dollars each year, with United States being the largest consumer of this phenomenal summertime treat.","answer":"Ancient Persians iced sweetened water, ground it into little pieces, and decorated it with tasty toppings and fruits.

Caesar countered this by ambushing Pompey's \\"hammer\\" element with a hidden fourth line of infantry;[5] Pompey's infantry was to be the anvil while his cavalry 'hammer' encircled Caesar's left flank. There was significant distance between the two armies, according to Caesar.[6]As the infantry of Caesar advanced, Pompey ordered his men not to charge, but to wait until Caesar's legions came into close quarters; Pompey's adviser Gaius Triarius believed that Caesar's infantry would be fatigued and fall into disorder if they were forced to cover twice the expected distance of a battle march. Also, stationary troops were expected to be able to defend better against pila throws.[7] Seeing that Pompey's army was not advancing, Caesar's infantry under Mark Antony and Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus started the advance. As Caesar's men neared throwing distance, without orders, they stopped to rest and regroup before continuing the charge;[8] Pompey's right and centre line held as the two armies collided. Caesar countered this by positioning the reserves of his 4th line to intercept the attacking cavalry.As Pompey's infantry fought, Labienus ordered the Pompeian cavalry on his left flank to attack Caesar's cavalry; as expected they successfully pushed back Caesar's cavalry. Caesar then revealed his hidden fourth line of infantry and surprised Pompey's cavalry charge; Caesar's men were ordered to leap up and use their pila to thrust at Pompey's cavalry instead of throwing them. Pompey's cavalry panicked and suffered hundreds of casualties, as Caesar's cavalry came about[9] and charged after them. After failing to reform, the rest of the Pompey's cavalry retreated to the hills, leaving the left wing of Pompey's legions exposed to the hidden troops as Caesar's cavalry wheeled around their flank. Caesar then ordered in his third line, containing his most battle-hardened veterans, to attack. This broke Pompey's left wing troops, who fled the battlefield.[10]","answer":"Pompey the Great expected the pila employed by Julius Caesar’s troops to be used as throwing weapons. He consequently ordered his troops to refrain from charging, in part to better defend against them. The hidden fourth line of infantry Caesar employed against Pompey’s cavalry did not throw their pila, but instead used them as thrusting weapons."},{"question":"Yes, it's a real shame.

With us so far?The trouble is, the faster you go, the further a car wants to be sucked to the floor. And if it gets too close it can cause the airflow to stop - or ‘stall’ - meaning the downforce created suddenly drops off a cliff. At that point, the cars spring upwards.Once the car’s floor is clear of the ground however, the flow of air kicks in again and the car is sucked downwards once more. This aggressive bouncing is porpoising.","answer":"F1 cars have a trick to go fast, instead of air going over a car, it goes underneath the car like a tunnel. This helps the car stick to the ground for better grip. When cars go fast, something strange happens, the cars get too close to the ground and the air doesn't flow properly anymore. The air stops flowing and the car no longer is being pushed down and instead springs up. Once the car springs up the airflow starts working again and pulls the car back down but then the cycle repeats. This effect is called porpoising.

It is away from the more congested routes of travel, and its unpretentious, unimposing structure means that it is often missed as foodies flock to the more trendy and glitzy locations closer to the beach.

You can still feel the salty breeze from the ocean air as you sit on the covered patio draped with well-established grape vines to shade the intimate atmosphere. The staff is knowledgeable about which wines to pair with your meals and appetizers. True to the European dining experience, you never feel rushed through your meal to make room for other patrons. It is the perfect way to spend a leisurely afternoon. The grape leaves were bright and tangy, with a fresh lemon flavor that is unparalleled. The same goes for the tazkiki and hummus. There was an abundance of fresh, vibrant herbs that enhanced each dish and tasted as if they had been harvested moments before hitting the plates.

This curvature gives rise to the force of gravity. And the greater the mass of a cosmic object, the more extreme the warping of space it causes.Light travels across the universe in straight lines, but when it encounters a warp caused by a truly massive object, its path is curved. When the warping object is between Earth and a background object, it can curve light in such a way that the apparent position of the background object is shifted.But when the intermediate or \\"lensing object\\" is truly massive — like a monstrous cluster of galaxies, for example — light from the background source takes a different amount of time to reach Earth depending on how close it passes to the natural cosmic lens. This effect, called gravitational lensing, can make single objects appear at multiple points in the sky, often in stunning arrangements called Einstein rings and Einstein crosses. It can also cause background objects to appear amplified in the sky, a powerful effect that astronomers use to observe distant and early faint galaxies.The distortion caused by massive clusters like eMACS J1823.1+7822 can also help astronomers study mysterious dark matter, which accounts for around 85% of the mass in the universe but is invisible because it does not interact with electromagnetic radiation. Because dark matter does interact gravitationally, however, the lensing of light by a galaxy or galactic cluster can help researchers map the distribution of dark matter.","answer":"This scientific news article discusses gravitational lensing, which is caused by massive cosmic objects and is in line with Einstein's theory of gravity. Objects with high mass can cause the bending of light paths due to the warping of space-time. Gravitational lensing occurs when a large object bends the path of light, causing a shift in the apparent position of a background object. Gravitational lensing creates stunning visual effects such as Einstein rings and crosses. Gravitational lensing helps astronomers see distant and faint galaxies by making them appear larger in the sky. Massive galaxy clusters like eMACS J1823.1+7822 help scientists map the distribution of dark matter, which makes up a significant portion of the universe's mass."},{"question":"Rewrite this article.Killer whales, or orcas, are the largest members of the oceanic dolphin family.

Intentional torts are wrongs that the defendant knew or should have known would result through his or her actions or omissions. Negligent torts occur when the defendant's actions were unreasonably unsafe. Unlike intentional and negligent torts, strict liability torts do not depend on the degree of care that the defendant used.

He nearly always went about on his own because, although he wanted to have lots of friends, he was too self-conscious.One day, the octopus was trying to catch a very slippery oyster. Before he knew it, he had tied himself into one massive knot, and he couldn't move. He tried with all his strength to wriggle free, but it was no good. In the end, despite the great embarrassment he felt at being seen in such a tangle, he had to ask for help from the passing fish. Many fish swam past, ignoring him, but one very kind little fish offered to help to untie all those tentacles from all those suckers.The octopus felt heartily relieved when he was finally set free, but he was so shy that he didn't dare talk to the fish and make friends with him. He simply thanked the fish, and quickly swam off. Later, the octopus spent the whole night thinking that he had wasted a great opportunity to make friends with that very kind little fish.A couple of days later the octopus was resting between some rocks, when he noticed that everyone around was hurriedly swimming past. He looked into the distance and saw an enormous fish coming over to feed in that area. The octopus quickly hid; then, peeping an eye out from his hiding place, he saw that the huge fish was chasing the kind little fish who had untied him. That little fish really needed urgent help, but the big fish was so dangerous-looking that no one dared to go near. The octopus, remembering how the little fish had helped him, felt that he had to do whatever he could to come to his aid.Without hesitating, the octopus shot out from the rocks, like a ray. He put himself right in the path of the giant fish, and before the fish could do anything about it, the octopus had shot out the biggest jet of ink of his life. He grabbed the little fish, and swam off back to hide in the rocks. Everything happened so fast that the big fish had no time to react. However, he soon recovered from the surprise. Off he went to the rocks, looking for the octopus and the little fish. Now he really wanted to gobble them down!Soon, though, he began feeling a terrible itch; first in his gills, and then in his fins, and then all over his body. It turned out that this giant fish had a very artistic nature, he adored colours; and the octopus's dark ink had given him a terrible allergy!!So the big fish swam away, irritated all over.As soon as he was gone, all the fish who had been hiding came and congratulated the octopus for being so brave. Then the little fish told them all how he had helped the octopus a few days earlier, but he had never known anyone be so grateful that they would end up doing something so dangerous. Hearing this, the other fish discovered how nice the shy octopus was, and everyone around was keen to be the friend of such a brave and honourable octopus.","answer":"Once upon a time, there was a shy and quiet sea turtle.

The hit to the massive sea turtle's shell had caused the enormous fish to get a headache. The enormous fish began to swim away giving up his search. As soon as the enormous fish was gone, all the other fish came out of their hiding places and thanked the sea turtle for being so courageous and brave. The little kind fish told them all how he had helped the sea turtle a few days ago and how he was grateful the sea turtle returned the favor.

Please include these details: Fancy is a black cat who lives in a house in the countryside but loves to spend her time outdoors in the forest when her loving owners are away working. Her best friend is a Schnauzer who also lives at the house named Buddy. When Buddy gets lost, Fancy has to go on a mission to find and rescue him with the help of a squirrel named Chip who becomes her friend too.

Let's make the story four paragraphs long, and make sure that it all ends on a good and happy note","answer":"Fancy The Forest Cat Once upon a time, there was a black cat named Fancy. Fancy lived in a nice house in the countryside, where she and her companion Buddy the Schnauzer were both loved by their owners. Fancy loved to spend time with her owners, but when they went to work each day, she would go outside to spend time in the woods with Buddy. Even though dogs usually chase cats, Fancy and Buddy were both really good friends. However, they both enjoyed chasing a squirrel named Chip, who always evaded them by going up into the trees when they would show up.One day, Buddy went out into the woods on his own, but he didn't come back for hours. This worried Fancy because Buddy never spent much time alone out in the woods. She decided that she needed to go find him before their owners came back home. So she set out into the woods to go find Buddy. She asked Chip if he knew where he was, but Chip was too scared to say anything because Fancy had always chased him and he was afraid she would do it again. Fancy assured Chip that she would never chase him again and apologized for doing so before. This reassured Chip when he realized that Fancy was sincere, and he said that he had heard from one of the deer in the woods that Buddy had gone east. Fancy and Chip set off in the easterly direction. They asked other animals along the way if they had seen Buddy, but none of them had. Fancy was getting more worried. Finally, just when all hope seemed lost, they met a raccoon named Rex who said he had seen a Schnauzer go into a farmer's cornfield at the edge of the forest not too long ago. Fancy and Chip went into the cornfield where they found Buddy! Buddy had gotten lost but he was so glad to see his friend Fancy again as they were reunited at last. He was surprised to see Chip, but Fancy told him that Chip was now their new friend too. Fancy led the way back to the house and the trio returned home before the owners of Fancy and Buddy arrived. Fancy, Buddy, and Chip all lived happily ever after in the house and the forest. The End."},{"question":"I'm an art student, and I'm going to be in Scottsdale in May.  What are 5 places I can go that have good art, especially modern art?","answer":"Sure, I can help you with that. Many places in Arizona have interesting modern art, especially in the Phoenix and Scottsdale areas.  Here are some ideas for you to visit in May: 1. The Phoenix Art Museum, which is not far from Scottsdale, has over 17,000 modern and contemporary works of art. The plus is, if you go with someone who likes other types of art as well, there will be something for everyone. 2. The Eye Lounge might be perfect for you if you like eclectic places where budding contemporary artists can show off their talent. Featuring many new artists, this is a space that exhibits conceptually stimulating artworks, which inspire discussion and introspection. 3. If you also like photography, a good option for visiting could be MonOrchid.  It's a split gallery exhibit space, which has the Bokeh Gallery and the Shade Gallery.  The Bokeh Gallery is mainly photographic artwork and digital collages. The Shade Gallery, however, is a significant space containing static and modular walls that can adapt to a variety of exhibitions. This is an ever-changing art space and is well-known by modern art enthusiasts. 4. Perhaps you should try going to Perihelion Arts, which is a cutting-edge contemporary art gallery/artist collective that was established by Amy Young. The gallery aims to reveal the very best of contemporary art to promote public interest in the arts, with a priority on art that pushes boundaries. This includes folk, surrealism, pop surrealism, outsider, and erotic art.5. Another option is Oblique Art, a contemporary urban arts space and pop-up gallery located in downtown Phoenix. Obliq Art was established in 2012 intending to showcase exceptional contemporary paintings, photography and mixed media created by local Arizona artists.These options are some of the most popular options for modern art, but there is more where that came from.  Depending on how long you'll be staying in Scottsdale, you may want to visit even more exhibits.

Saturn now has 121 known irregular moons along with its 24 regular moons. Irregular moons like these new ones tend to bunch up in groupings depending on the tilt of their orbits. Saturn's system currently hosts three of these groupings — the Inuit group, the Gallic group and the densely populated Norse group, all of which take their names from different mythologies. All of the newfound moons of Saturn fall into one of these three currently existing groupings. Three of the new moons belong to the Inuit group, but the majority fit in the Norse group.The moons in these three groups are believed to have been created when larger moons around Saturn originally captured by the gas giant slammed together and fragmented. Investigating the orbits of Saturn's irregular moons could help astronomers better understand the history of such collisions in the gas giant system.The team behind the new discovery thinks that the large number of tiny moons in a retrograde orbit around Saturn (that is, opposite in direction to the planet's orbit) is evidence of a collision between irregular moons around the gas giant as recently as 100 million years ago. This collision is believed to have created the moons in the Norse group. \\"As one pushes to the limit of modern telescopes, we are finding increasing evidence that a moderate-sized moon orbiting backward around Saturn was blown apart something like 100 million years ago,\\" team member and University of British Columbia astronomer Brett Gladman said in the same statement.Jupiter leap-frogged Saturn for the moon crown in February 2023 when 12 new moons were found around the solar system's largest planet, bringing the total number of known Jovian moons to 92.But the moon title is not set in stone; it could change hands again as astronomers' techniques for discovering moons continue to improve.","answer":"In the unfathomable cosmos, the newly identified lunar bodies encircling the celestial giant Saturn have been christened \\"irregular moons.\\" These celestial oddities are thought to have been trapped by the inexorable gravitational pull of a planet and, consequently, were coaxed into elliptical orbits - much larger and more inclined than those of the regular moons.Currently, Saturn boasts of possessing 121 such eccentric companions along with its 24 regular satellites. These irregular moons, including the fresh recruits, tend to cluster in groups, their formation dictated by the inclinations of their orbits. The gas titan's lunar system is home to three such confluences — the Inuit, Gallic, and Norse collectives, their names derived from diverse mythologies.Every one of these freshly spotted moons has found a home within these three existing celestial families. While three of the new moons have pledged their allegiance to the Inuit family, the Norse clan has claimed the majority.These celestial assemblies are postulated to have sprung into existence following catastrophic collisions between larger moons, initially ensnared by Saturn, resulting in cosmic fragmentation. Scrutinizing the orbits of these irregular moons could lend astronomers key insights into the annals of such celestial skirmishes within Saturn's domain.The architects of this new discovery speculate that the profusion of miniature moons in a retrograde orbit — a trajectory contrary to the planet's own orbit — is a testament to a cataclysmic event as recent as 100 million years ago. This space disaster is thought to be the celestial birthplace of the Norse group of moons.\\"The fringes of contemporary telescopic capabilities reveal that a moderately sized moon, trailing a path against Saturn's orbit, was blasted into oblivion approximately 100 million years ago,\\" proclaimed Brett Gladman, an esteemed astronomer at the University of British Columbia, in an official statement.The celestial competition for moon supremacy witnessed a temporary upset when Jupiter, the solar system's behemoth, edged ahead of Saturn in February 2023. The discovery of 12 new moons encircling Jupiter nudged its total moon tally to 92.

I want to include some classic races of supernatural creatures. Please give me five options I could go with, and tell me a bit about them. ","answer":"I can do that! Here are five classic supernatural creatures you might want to incorporate into your story.1: Vampires: Vampires have been used in mythology and stories for centuries, and there have been many iterations of them. Their lore tends to be that they are undead creatures of the night, with long fangs used to drink blood, and they can often turn into bats. Some versions of vampires created for stories or present in mythology are allergic to garlic, burned by sunlight, and can only be killed by a crucifix. 2. Werewolves: Another classic supernatural creature often presented as a mortal enemy of the vampire is the werewolf. The werewolf is a creature that presents as human most of the time but, on a full moon, turns into a wolf. Depending on the story, this may be a classic version of a wolf or it may be a more monstrous version. Legends often say that if someone is bitten by a werewolf on the full moon, they will then turn into one.3. Ghosts: Ghosts are also supernatural creatures and subjects of many stories, and are typically humans who did not pass onto the afterlife, leaving a form of them stuck wandering the earth. Ghosts may be friendly to humans or not. There are many other names for ghosts, such as specters, spirits, and poltergeists (who are usually evil ghosts).4. Mages: Mages are humans who have been gifted with the ability of magic, also called witches, wizards, and sorcerers. Mages may be good, evil, or inherently neither in a story, and the magic they can do may vary. Sometimes, mages are not separate creatures at all but humans who have learned to do magic. They may also have animal familiars, though this is typically for witches.5. Demons: Born from religion, demons are also supernatural creatures that are sometimes used in fictional stories. They are creatures who have come from Hell, and may or may not have been human a long time ago, depending on the iteration of them. They are there to cause chaos and even harm to humans and usually make good villains in a story."},{"question":"I am planning to grow indeterminate tomatoes in my garden. Help me brainstorm a list of five types of tomato supports that I could use. Explain each method in one sentence.","answer":"No problem. Here are five ideas of ways that you can support tomato plants in the garden:1. Single Stake - This method uses one strong stake for each tomato plant. The stalk of the plant is tied to the stake using a cloth or similar material as it grows.2. Florida Weave - This support system is made from strings tied horizontally to a few stakes that go along a row of tomatoes. The string creates the support.3. Cage - Cages constructed from wire are placed over the top of the tomato plant, providing support as the plant grows up through the cage center.4. Vertical String - This method requires an overhead structure that a string is tied to. The string is pulled tight and staked in the ground, creating support.5. Trellis - With this method, the tomato plant is secured to the trellis as it grows, allowing for vertical, as well as some horizontal support."},{"question":"Make up a 5 question multiple choice quiz for my music production students.

Time tracking takes time! But mostly it takes mindfulness. Learning to monitor what you’re doing every 15 minutes takes some getting used to. I often find myself looking up and suddenly realizing I’m not sure what I’ve done for the last 40 minutes, sometimes longer—which of course is notable in itself. On the positive side, I like seeing the columns fill up. I can tell there are patterns to be deciphered and improved upon. *There’s an option to track your time every half-hour if fifteen-minute intervals feels excessive, but so far I’m thinking I’ll stick with fifteen. 2. The mere act of tracking my time helps me be more intentional. When I know I have to account for my time, even if only to myself, I find myself making wiser decisions. I plan my days more carefully. I started writing this post a few days ago, but I’m finishing it while waiting for a replacement driver’s license at the DMV. It’s not unusual for me to productively use waiting time. I think what’s different is that today I made this my default state instead of just looking at my phone or zoning out. I knew I’d need to account for what became a 30-minute wait, so I made sure to use it well. 3. Momentum matters. Week I of tracking my time flew by and I only got behind a couple of afternoons. With a trip to New York City and a few other things that threw off my schedule in Week II, I got much more behind. There’s definitely a sense of momentum or inertia to this process: stay on track and you’ll want to keep it going, lose a few hours and you’ll feel discouraged. Laura notes that most people have irregular weeks, but you shouldn’t wait for a “regular” week to start tracking. Disruptions happen in every week. I always have different projects to work on and I typically travel every week, so if I waited for a “normal” week at home I’d be waiting a long time. If I continue this discipline beyond another couple of weeks, I’ll need to make sure I integrate it into my traveling life. 4. I don’t feel guilty about intentional time that isn’t spent productively. I don’t really have hobbies (I’ve tried!) and I sometimes say that relaxing stresses me out. There are a lot of intervals I filled up with items “reading,” “walking to gym,” “phone call with a friend,” or even “search for mistake fares for post-WDS Asia trip.” And I liked that! I don’t feel that these things detract from my other goals at all. I don’t want to avoid or minimize them; in some ways I’d like to do more of them. What I want to avoid is wasted time. Almost every day I have numerous 15-minute intervals that I don’t know what to label because I don’t remember what I did. This, at least for me, means that I frittered away the time without doing anything productive or taking time for myself in an intentional way.","answer":"Time tracking allows you to be more mindful, intentional, and productive. It helps maintain momentum and avoid wasted time while also allowing for intentional leisure time. By tracking how time is spent, individuals can identify time-wasting activities and adjust their schedules accordingly. This creates more time for productive tasks and ensures consistent progress toward goals. Additionally, intentional leisure time prevents burnout and promotes overall well-being."},{"question":"Shorten the following text to less than 50 words: Plant oils have been used medicinally for over 2,500 years. The first references to the use of plant oils can be traced to Chinese medicine, also known as Traditional Chinese Medicine.Various parts of plants were consumed in either the raw state or dried, boiled, or steamed (to extract the oil). The end product was then consumed, inserted into any one of the natural openings of the body, massaged into the skin, or inhaled in vapor form.During the Medieval period, a collection of medicinal treatments for a variety of ailments was published by Abu Ali al-Husain Ebn Abdullah Ebn Sina (980–1037 AD). He was known in the West as Avicenna, a Persian physician who was also known as one of the most influential medical writers in the medieval period.Avicenna\`s Canon of Medicine, arguably one of the most famous books in the history of medicine, presents a clear and organized summary of all of the medical knowledge of the time, including a long list of drugs. Interestingly, lily and spotted orchid oils are mentioned as remedies for tinnitus (Mahdizadeh et al, 2015).Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, advances in western medicine progressed. The American Medical Association was founded in 1847 and the American Pharmaceutical Association was founded in 1852.

The year was 1998 and it captivated the whole nation. Two men from historic rival teams going all summer long trying to outlast and outhit the other. It was nothing short of epic and without Sosa's race, baseball would not be the popular sport that it is today.His resume is impressive too. He hit over 600 home runs which not even 10 players in the entire history of the sport have done. He also won an MVP award in 1998 and numerous other awards like Silver Sluggers and was a perennial all-star. Sammy Sosa embodied baseball in the late 90s and early 00s. But now the industry is doing him wrong by trying to sweep him and all those other great hitters under the rug.Yes, I know it was the steroid era.  But everyone was juicing and we all knew it. It was that unspoken compact that nobody ever brought up because it didn't need to be said. The league knew it and wanted to profit from all the eyes on the sport, we fans knew it but we were enjoying the competition too much to care, and the players knew it but were reaching new heights in their careers. I'm not saying it was okay but I am saying the players we loved shouldn't be the ones bearing the blame for it all. I, as a fan, share in the culpability and still want the best of that era in the hall. Players like Sosa.So please don't let his legacy fade away. The numbers back it up and if you want to shave off 100 home runs he's still an amazing athlete. Plus you add on how much he helped revive America's past-time and it can't be denied that Sosa belongs in the hallowed halls of Cooperstown.

It's about the Tulsa Race Massacre.Governor James B. A. Robertson had gone to Tulsa during the riot to ensure order was restored. Before returning to the capital, he ordered an inquiry into events, especially of the City and Sheriff's Office. He called for a Grand Jury to be empaneled, and Judge Valjean Biddison said that its investigation would begin June 8. The jury was selected by June 9. Judge Biddison expected that the state attorney general would call numerous witnesses, both black and white, given the large scale of the riot.[120]State Attorney General S.P. Freeling initiated the investigation, and witnesses were heard over 12 days. In the end, the all-white jury attributed the riot to the black mobs, while noting that law enforcement officials had failed in preventing the riot. A total of 27 cases were brought before the court, and the jury indicted more than 85 individuals. In the end, no one was convicted of charges for the deaths, injuries or property damage.[121]On June 3, a group of over 1,000 businessmen and civic leaders met, resolving to form a committee to raise funds and aid in rebuilding Greenwood. Judge J. Martin, a former mayor of Tulsa, was chosen as the chairman of the group. He said at the mass meeting:Tulsa can only redeem herself from the country-wide shame and humiliation into which she is today plunged by complete restitution and rehabilitation of the destroyed black belt. The rest of the United States must know that the real citizenship of Tulsa weeps at this unspeakable crime and will make good the damage, so far as it can be done, to the last penny.[120]Many black families spent the winter of 1921–1922 in tents as they worked to rebuild. Charles Page was commended for his philanthropic efforts in the wake of the riot in the assistance of 'destitute blacks'.[122]A group of influential white developers persuaded the city to pass a fire ordinance that would have prohibited many black people from rebuilding in Greenwood. Their intention was to redevelop Greenwood for more business and industrial use and force black people further to the edge of the city for residences. The case was litigated and appealed to the Oklahoma Supreme Court by Buck Colbert Franklin, where the ordinance was ruled unconstitutional. Most of the promised funding was never raised for the black residents, and they struggled to rebuild after the violence. Willows, the regional director of the Red Cross, noted this in his report, explaining his slow initial progress to facilitate the rehabilitation of the refugees. The fire code was officially intended to prevent another tragedy by banning wooden frame construction houses in place of previously burnt homes. A concession was granted to allow temporary wooden frame dwellings while a new building, which would meet the more restrictive fire code, was being constructed. This was quickly halted as residents within two weeks had started to erect full-sized wooden frame dwellings in contravention of the agreement. It took a further two-month delay to secure the court decision to reinstate the previous fire code. Willows heavily criticized the Tulsa city officials for interfering with his efforts, for their role in the Public Welfare Committee which first sought to rezone the \\"burned area\\" as industrial, and for constructing a union station in its place with no consideration for the refugees. Then he criticized them again for the dissolution of the Public Welfare Committee in favor of the formation of the Reconstruction Committee which failed to formulate a single plan, leaving the displaced residents prohibited from beginning reconstruction efforts for several months.[123]","answer":"In the aftermath of the Tulsa Race Massacre, a Grand Jury investigated the issue over twelve days, ultimately ruling that the riot had been the result of black mobs.

The band's singer and lyricist, Robert Plant, has said that he drew inspiration from the work of Scottish writer Lewis Spence, notably from his book Magic Arts in Celtic Britain. This influence is a strong part of the mysticism and allegories contained within the lyrics. There are references to the May Queen, an allusion to the Virgin Mary, as well as the Piper and the Wild West. The song explores themes of purity, materialism, greed, arrogance, and spirituality. The ultimate message that Led Zeppelin put forward in this song is that the Stairway to Heaven is a spiritual journey made up of discovering the power of community and our need to live together in harmony with our souls and nature.

Start with why turtles can make great pets, explain that different species of turtles may have different diets, and tell readers how often the turtles should be fed as well. Tone should be conversational ","answer":"If you're looking for a cool pet that's way easier to take care of than a dog or cat, a turtle can be a great option. Turtles don't need a lot of attention, or expensive training classes like many other pets. What turtles do need is a proper diet. In this article, I'll tell you what you need to know about feeding your pet turtle. Turtles are omnivores, which means they eat plant and animal matter. You can feed your pet turtle pellets, cooked meats (like chicken or turkey), leafy greens (like collards), fruits (like apples and bananas) or even live insects (like crickets). However, some foods are bad for your turtle, like chives and spinach. It's best to do your research when you're deciding whether or not to add a certain food to your turtle's diet. Turtles need to be fed more often when they're young. Juvenile turtles need to eat around twice a day. Adult turtles are usually fine with eating just once every day, or even once every other day depending on the species. When you feed your turtle, leave the food there for about 20 minutes, then take it away. That's generally enough time for turtles to eat what they need. Remember that different species of turtles can have different feeding needs, so research you're turtle before deciding on a specific feeding plan.

They proclaim a holiday for their subjects to pay homage to the princess, and at her christening she is betrothed to Prince Phillip, the son of King Stefan's friend King Hubert, to unite their kingdoms.Among the guests are the three good fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather. Flora and Fauna bless Aurora with beauty and song, respectively, but Merryweather's gift is interrupted by the arrival of the evil fairy Maleficent. As revenge for not being invited, she curses Aurora, proclaiming that the princess will grow in grace and beauty, but before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die.

Astra gave Nova intelligence beyond measure, Celestia gave her a voice that could harmonize with the cosmos, and Lyra was about to give her a gift when Malvora, a malevolent sorceress, emerged from the depths of the galaxy.

Write it in a style that a young girl would like.","answer":"Once upon a time, in a big city, there was a little girl named Ruby who loved her mommy and daddy, but also loved unicorns more than anything else in the world. She had posters of them on her wall, wore unicorn headbands, and even had a unicorn backpack for school. One day, as she was walking through the park, she stumbled upon a beautiful unicorn with a rainbow mane and a shimmering horn. Ruby's heart skipped a beat as she gazed at the unicorn in awe.\\"Hello, little one,\\" said the unicorn, her voice as soft as a lullaby.Ruby could hardly believe her eyes. She had never seen a real unicorn before, and she was thrilled to be standing so close to one. She was excited, happy, and nervous all at the same time.\\"I wish I could be a unicorn,\\" Ruby said with a sigh. \\"They're so magical and beautiful, and they can do anything they want.\\"The unicorn smiled and nuzzled her gently. \\"You know, my dear, you don't have to be a unicorn to be magical and beautiful. You're special just the way you are. The most magical and beautiful thing you can do is become my friend. Will you come to visit me again sometime?\\"Ruby nodded and felt a warm glow in her heart at the unicorn's kind words. She had always felt a little bit ordinary, but now she realized that being ordinary was just fine. Ruby waved goodbye to the unicorn and skipped home, feeling happy and content in her own skin. She knew that she didn't need to be anyone else to be amazing, and that was the most magical thing of all."},{"question":"I am trying to come up with a name for a specific coloration of a new flower I hybridized, and that got me thinking about how new things are named. Please brainstorm for me a few different ways that people decide on names for new flowers or other new things and explain how each idea is used. ","answer":"I can help with that! Here are some ways people choose names for new things:- The Creator's Name - Many people include their own last or first name in a flower they create or discover. This ensures that they are remembered as being the person who created it. This can be their unaltered name, a nickname, or an alteration of their name that seems to fit the plant more for whatever reason. - Someone's Name - Along with being named after the creator, it is also fairly common to name a plant after a loved one, a movie star, a mentor, etc. - It's Appearance - Most flowers are named after something that has to do with their appearance, whether this is the shape of their leaves, the color of their flowers, or something else unique about the plant. For example, a flower variation that is blue might be named Sky Blue, Ocean View, or something else that brings to mind the color. - Something Important - Some people who name things choose a name that has meaning for them. For example, if you have another hobby besides your flowers that you enjoy, you could include that hobby in the name. Also, if you have been through a tough time, you can make the name hopeful or include any word that has meaning to you.Hopefully, this helps you come up with name ideas for your new flower!"},{"question":"Recently, I've been feeling as if I'm not fully engaged with everything. How could i be more mindful and would it be helpful?","answer":"Being mindful is to be fully engaged and present in the moment. This can be very hard for some but there are quite a few things you can do to gradually improve. Living in the moment is an expression commonly used, but people often brush off the real meaning. Living in the moment is to enjoy the things you are doing, to actively know what you are doing, and to take it all in. You may find yourself spacing out sometimes, but try your best to focus on the things around you. The best exercise to practice mindfulness is meditation. Meditation is not only sitting down with your legs crossed as often thought, but meditation is the practice of focus. Calming yourself, and controlling your thoughts and breathing, allows you to become more aware. You can also do this while walking. This will help you to become more focused on the things you are doing. Overall, being mindful does not just happen. You have to actively do things in order to feel the effects. Remember that it's important to consult a professional if you have any mental health concerns.

Discovered by a 20th Century Fox scout in 1939, he signed a contract with Columbia Pictures shortly thereafter. He made his official debut in Heaven with a Barbed Wire Fence (1939). He had numerous small film roles until he joined the Marines during World War II. In 1943, Ford married dancer and actress Eleanor Powell (the first of four marriages that all ended in divorce) with whom he had his only child, Peter Ford. After the war, he found it difficult to restart his career until Bette Davis gave him a role in A Stolen Life (1946). Ford followed that with the role that made him a star, Gilda (1946). Often cast as a calm, everyday hero in films such as The Big Heat (1953), Blackboard Jungle (1955) 3:10 to Yuma (1957), and The Rounders (1965), he worked continually in film and television through the 1990s.

Much of Greenland is covered by ice, and all these regions are sparsely populated, although there are several large cities in Canada. These are mainly in the south of the country and on the Pacific coast near the stunning Rocky Mountains. Huge oil and mineral reserves have brought wealth to both Canada and Alaska.Alaska was part of Russia until 1867, when it was sold to the US for 7.2 million. Most Americans thought this was a huge waste of money until gold was discovered there in 1896, attracting many people hoping to make their fortune. The discovery of oil in the Arctic Ocean in 1968 brought great wealth to the state, and tourism is also a major source of income.The First Nations and the Inuit peoples lived in Canada long before Europeans began settling there in the 17th century. They number about 900,000 people, or 4 percent of the population, and have kept many of their traditional customs and traditions. In 1999, the self-governing Inuit homeland of Nunavut was created in northern Canada.Greenland is the world’s largest island, but has a population of less than 60,000 because its climate is so harsh and cold. Most live in small settlements along the coast, making a living from catching fish, shrimp, and seals. There is a small network of roads, but dogsleds and planes are more reliable than cars for getting around.","answer":"The region includes Canada, Alaska, and Greenland with a low population density. Canada has large cities in the south and on the Pacific coast close to the Rocky Mountains. First Nations and Inuit peoples reside in Canada and have preserved their customary practices.

The presence of the Patriotic-insert-bots causes the Bad-bots to attack Sam and his girlfriend Mikaela Bads. More Patriotic-insert-bots arrive on Earth to find the McGuffinBox which is a source of limitless power that can create life and entire worlds which is ironic considering the lifeless sales pitch of this movie that will use 4th wall breaks to self-parody itself in an attempt to dodge any criticism.It turns out the McGuffinBox can only be created by fusing 19,000 sponsors.

Here are some ideas for what the guns could shoot: - Lasers - There already exists lasers that can cut through things, so the guns could have this in them. Pulling the trigger turns it on, and you could say that to prevent it from overheating, it can only turn on for half a second at a time. - Explosives - Think of this option like a miniature grenade launcher. In your sci-fi world, they have invented highly volatile compounds that will explode with only a few drops. These few drops are put in something the size and shape of a bullet. How powerful you want the explosive to be is up to you. - Poison Vials - Guns could fire small containers of an easily obtained poison or chemical. Perhaps there are even different grades of poison, depending on how lethal you want it to be. The vials always break when they are shot at something, and if the poison is acidic enough, can melt into whatever they are shot at. Maybe only a few drops need to touch the skin for the person to die. - Nanites - A group of nanites could be in a ball or any other shape and are programmed to only attach when fired and to attack whatever they are fired at.

The rain pelted harder on the metal roof, a repeated pinging that hadn't ceased for several hours. It would be muddy, impossible to see, and miserable to trek on foot, but they needed the food. The house was near invisible as he ventured out through the front door. It's funny how dark everything becomes when you no longer have electricity. Not that they could have used it, anyway; the Intruders would have used the light as a beacon to find their hiding spots. His feet sunk slightly into the wet ground with every step, and he had to continually wipe the rain from his eyes. It would be a slow and tedious journey tonight. But as long as he went slow and kept his motions quiet, he would be safe.

The question was whether climbers that season had left a man to die and whether he could have been saved.

The story has apparently grown beyond the scope of the mountaineering community as many have been interviewed by the media. Allegations and critiques have come from many sources. Have climbers in the 2006 season left a man to die when he still had a chance to be saved? Sources say that Sharp tried to climb the mountain by himself with no guides, and it's said he even brought fewer oxygen bottles than normal. His guide firm in Nepal was a low-budget service that provided him service as far as Base Camp, but after that point, they expect climbers to continue as a \\"loose group,\\" which allows for a great deal of independence. The manager told us that Sharp didn't have enough oxygen with him for his climb and chose not to have a Sherpa guide. The question is who knew that Sharp was in trouble? If they did know, were they even qualified or capable of helping him? One fellow climber, a double-amputee named Mark Inglis, claims that his party, along with several others, passed Sharp on their trek. He was reportedly sheltering beneath a rock overhang that was 450 metres below the summit, but none attempted a rescue. Inglis also said that 40 people had passed Sharp, but they might not have noticed him and instead thought he was the corpse nicknamed \\"Green Boots.\\" What Inglis didn't know was that a party of Turkish climbers did try to help Sharp, even though they were already helping an injured woman (Turkish Burçak Poçan). Himex has also been discussed in the commentary on Inglis and Sharp. It's interesting to note that Inglis later revises his story, claiming that at the time he was first interviewed, he was \\"...physically and mentally exhausted, and in a lot of pain. He had suffered severe frostbite--he later had five fingertips amputated.\\" A search of Sharp's possessions found a receipt for US7,490 which is thought to be his entire cost for the climb. Most expeditions cost between 35,000 and 100,000, not to mention an additional 20,000 in other expenses like gear and bonuses. It is believed that Sharp summited on 14 May before beginning his descent, but on 15 May he encountered trouble. At this point, he was being passed by other climbers, and it's believed that he was experiencing hypoxia at around 300 metres from the summit.Beck Weathers, who participated in the 1996 Mount Everest expedition that ended in disaster, claims that those who are dying tend to be left behind. Apparently, he had been left for dead himself on two separate occasions but had been able to keep walking and save himself. The Tribune of Chandigarh, India describes Sharp's predicament as \\"the most shameful act in the history of mountaineering.\\" Nine other climbers also died in 2006, including Sherpas working for guide firms. The Discovery Channel captures a lot of the controversy in their television program Everest: Beyond the Limit. One very important piece of  Sharp's story is shown in the program when an early-returning climber named Maxim Chaya radioed his base camp manager (Russell Brice) to say that he had found a frostbitten and unconscious climber in distress. Chaya couldn't identify Sharp because he had chosen to not identify himself to other climbers. Instead of sending help, the base camp manager assumed that Sharp was a member of a group that had already abandoned him. He told Chaya that he wouldn't be able to help Sharp on his own, so Chaya left him. Sharp's condition continued to worsen and his chances of rescue grew smaller as climbers continue to pass him in their descent. The frostbite was making his legs and feet curl, preventing him from walking, and later descending climbers were low on oxygen and strength themselves. As the day continued, time ran out for Sherpas to come back and rescue him. Sharp's body remained where it was, just below the summit on the Chinese side, next to \\"Green Boots.\\" They shared a small rock cave that also acted as their tomb. The BBC reports that Sharp's body was removed in 2007, and Green Boots has been missing since 2014, likely moved or buried.

Wilson: Certainly not the world’s favorite Batman, Lewis G. Wilson was the youngest and least athletic actor ever to take on the role, and he didn’t have quite the Batman voice that everyone has come to    love. - Robert Lowery: In the 1940s and 50s, Robert Lowery played Batman several times and was considered quite an upgrade from his predecessor. - Adam West: For several decades, Adam West played a flamboyant version of Batman, who had a controversial goofy charm. - Michael Keaton: After 20 years of Adam West, Michael Keaton changed the role forever. Although people didn’t believe he was right for the job, after the first film came out, the masses were mad at Keaton as    Batman. - Kevin Conroy: Technically the most accurate Batman to date, Kevin Conroy gave Batman the voice every actor has used since. - Val Kilmer: Though some say that Val Kilmer was a good Batman, many felt as though he was no Michael Keaton and were unimpressed with the sudden change. - George Clooney: In 1997, George Clooney was nowhere near as famous as he is now, and while his role as Batman certainly didn’t hurt his career, it also didn’t do anything to further it as everyone who watched it    seemed to hate it. - Christian Bale: By the time Christian Bale came into the role, audiences didn’t expect much from Batman actors. And although his bat voice was considered imperfect in many ways, Bale’s rendition of the character    generally got better reviews than most of the others who took on the role. - Will Arnett: Most people don’t realize that Will Arnett played Batman in The LEGO Movie, but those who did see him in the role absolutely loved his comedic take on the superhero. - Ben Affleck: When word got out that Ben Affleck was to play Batman in the new film Batman vs. Superman, audiences were hesitant to get excited. However, the general consensus now is that Affleck excelled in the    role due to his rugged good looks and charm. - Robert Pattinson: Playing the role very differently than anyone before, Pattinson made Batman the strange orphan he actually was, and once again, although no one thought he would excel in the role, he surprised    bat-fans everywhere with his take on the character.

The ideology transcends the actualization.Simone: The shorthand came from a group of intellectuals, so when those intellectuals espouse the same ideology, even without naming it or invoking it, it's still assigned by those who wish to destroy the intellectual. Anti-intellectualism is at the center of cultural Marxism's existence in the United States. That's a phenomenon that also surpasses its own definition since the origin of cultural Marxism is in the Frankfurt School's migration of thought. Kyndrie: The famous figures are not the figures of today! They're the youth. It's an exaggeration by those who hate youthful intelligence that it's a dominant thought process or culture.Simone: Exactly.Kyndrie: The caricatures of cultural Marxism we see online are based only on one side of the historical context.

The tone should be casual, entertaining, and with some dry humor rather than academic or somber.","answer":"1. We all know how tempting it can be to write off ex-lovers, nightmare bosses, former friends, and difficult family members by giving them an armchair diagnosis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder—but the reality of NPD is a bit more complex and nuanced than many people realize.2. When you’ve got a difficult narcissist in your life, it can be all too easy to presume that their problematic behavior stems from an overabundance of self-love, when in fact the opposite is true; despite their bravado, people suffering from narcissistic personality disorder are actually deeply insecure.3. It’s ironic that the myth of Narcissus—the tale that forms most people’s understanding of Narcissistic Personality Disorder—portrays the young man staring ceaselessly at his mirror image because, in real life, NPD could be explained as an inability to reflect or look inward.4. If you have a difficult narcissistic personality in your life—or several—you may be put off by the suggestion that you see a professional therapist for your struggles since you’re not the one with a problem; but seeing as people with NPD are extremely unlikely to seek professional help or change themselves, this may actually be your best option.5.

He only came as part of a mandatory business trip, and now he had to see his coworker’s plates piled higher than their chests with gooey cheese bites and crispy shrimp. The slot machines on The Strip failed to tempt Stu when his coworkers were gambling their money away in celebration of closing the new deal, but the honey-glaze on the bbq ribs had a different type of power.As a courtesy, Stu had paid for a plate before sitting down because the anxiety to come if the buffet staff might suspect him of sneaking food without paying would be unbearable. So, there it was: a large, empty white plate sitting in front of him. The buffet ticket included a drink, but Stu refused that pleasure as well. Stu began rethinking his life decisions. He had been on this new diet for months and other diets for years with no rewards to show for any of it. The only thing he gained was a conversation topic everyone was tired of hearing about. Stu could no longer simply place the entire blame on food—there must be a different solution.Stu had enough.

Various muscles perform unique functions, which can be classified as:• Skeletal muscle - Specialized tissue that is attached to the bones, and allows movement which is controlled through voluntary conscious control. These muscles are typically grouped into opposing pairs, such as biceps and triceps, and together form the musculoskeletal system with the bones. • Smooth muscle - Muscles that are not under human conscious control, these are located in various internal structures such as the digestive tract, blood vessels, and arteries. These muscles are arranged in layered sheets along the length of the structure, which contract in wave-like motions.• Cardiac muscle - specifically the heart, which is a muscle that contracts and relaxes without human control to pump blood throughout the body."},{"question":"What is the overall tone of the attached poem?

Over the same period, the average age of Tokyo’s farmers increased by 3.3 years, to nearly 64. Today, Ryoto Matsuzawa says there are 1,250 farms left, most of which are under one hectare in size. “We want to preserve those at all costs.”The city recently made a crucial decision to do so. Eighty percent of the farms protected under the Law on Productive Green Areas were registered the year that law was enacted, in 1992. The law stipulates that after 30 years, the landowners can ask the city to buy their land at market price. But most cities, strapped for cash, can’t afford to. If they don’t, the land loses its tax subsidy and can be sold for commercial development.In other words, about 80 percent of the farms protected under the law were eligible to come up for sale in 2022. “These areas are nearly 45 percent of the agricultural land in Tokyo,” says Ryoto Matsuzawa.","answer":"Between 2005 and 2015, the number of farms in Tokyo decreased by 14.5 percent and the average age of farmers increased by 3.3 years. Preserving Tokyo's remaining 1,250 small farms feels priceless to many, but there is an ongoing issue where many cities cannot afford to buy the land protected under the Productive Green Areas Law at market value, as legally required. This leads to the land being lost for agricultural use, and usually being sold for commercial development."},{"question":"I'm getting prepared for a really important job interview, and I'm trying to decide what to wear. Help me think through what colors to wear to the interview and which ones are good for a first impression as a potential employee.","answer":"Here are a few color options for interviews and what they may portray to your potential employer:1. Blue - This is the most highly recommended color to wear according to experts. The color blue can convey a feeling of trustworthiness and credibility, which are good traits no matter what position you're going for.2. Black - This color is usually associated with leadership, strength, and ability. Of course, these are great qualities to convey, but keep in mind that it may appear to be too aloof if you're applying for a position in customer service for example.3. Grey - This color, although neutral, can convey a logical and analytical professional. Keep in mind that if you tend to sweat when you're nervous, grey will show this more, so you may want to keep the color only on pants or a jacket.4. White - White gives the impression of someone who is organized, detail-oriented, and clean. This is a classic color that can be matched with just about anything else, so consider adding some colorful accessories that show more of who you are."},{"question":"I have just joined a band playing bass. Someone said I should have a few tools around for gigs. Give me a list of tools I should keep in a bag in case something goes wrong on stage.","answer":"Here is a list of tools you should have in your gig bag:- A small multi-screwdriver. This can be handy for tightening loose screws on equipment or making sure the knobs on your gear are secure. There are hobbyist screwdrivers that have multiple tips stored in the body or shaft. In a pinch, you could even use the mini toolset for repairing eyeglasses. These sets are often cheap and low quality, but the screwdrivers tend to be good enough for a quick fix on stage.- A flashlight. While there may be stage lighting during the performance, if you need to make a quick repair, it is better to have a small but effective light source of your own, in case of emergencies. You can certainly use the big bulky one from home, but a pen light might be more effective and easier to use when you need to hold tools as well. If hands-free is your thing, you could also get a headlamp, which usually has a small strap attached to it. But if you have a modern cell phone, you probably already have an app that turns on the camera flash.- Pliers. A small pair of pliers can work wonders for a bent jack or for cutting and replacing a broken string. They don’t need to be too big, and you can usually find a small set of two or three at your favorite hardware store. - Allen/hex key set. These might not be completely necessary for certain players, but Allen screws are used on a lot of musical equipment, so it would be a good idea to have a set around. While you can buy keys as a set for a toolbox, keep on the lookout for a set that looks like a Swiss Army knife, commonly called a Gui-Tool. These specialty tools often have screwdriver bits built in, making it a very effective multi-tool to have in your arsenal.Although there are far more tools available, this should get you started and have you prepared for many unforeseen circumstances at your show.

I already have a litter box and litter, but that's it.","answer":"Of course! Here is a list of items to get ahead of bringing your new kitten home:1. Cat Carrier: It's important to keep your cat safe during travel, so make sure to pick out an appropriate-sized carrier for bringing your kitten home and on future vet trips.2. Kitten Food: Kittens need nutrient-packed food to support their growth, unlike adult cats, so make sure to pick out an appropriate food.3. Bowls: Food bowls come in many different forms. You could choose an elevated bowl, slow feeder, or automatic feeder, and even treat your cat to a water fountain (which will encourage them to hydrate).4. Treats: Treats are one of the best ways to help your kitten bond with you!5. Nail Trimmer: Routine nail trims protect your cat from infections and ingrown nails, as well as protect your furniture.6: Cat Brush: It's important to keep your cat well-groomed to avoid mats, particularly if your cat has medium or long hair. Long-haired cats should be brushed every day, while shorter hair cats should be brushed around once a week. 7. Toothbrush and Kitty Toothpaste: To keep your cat's teeth healthy and prevent gum disease, you'll want to introduce your kitten to teeth brushing as early as possible. This helps desensitize them in the future and makes the task easier.8. Toys: There are a wide variety of kitten toys on the market, so choose some that look fun and experiment with what your cat likes. Every kitten is different!9. Scratching Post: All cats scratch. If you don't give them an outlet, it might be on your couch! Consider spacing multiple scratching posts around the house.10. Cat Bed: Your cat may never use their bed, but it's nice to have it if they'd like their own space.11. Cat Tree: Cats feel safest in high spots, which means a cat tree can help them feel at home in their new place quickly.

Can you summarize the main points made in this article? Keep it to three sentences and include the states that have imposed this ban.Article:What is the Plastic Bag Ban?As the name states, these bans are bans on single-use plastic bags. Many states around the nation are beginning their bans on plastic bags. These bans will ban all single-use plastic bags, such as the ones that are popularly used at grocery stores and in restaurants for take-out orders.With these bans in effect, single-use plastic bags will not be accessible for purchase to both shoppers and business owners. As a result, paper bags and reusable cloth bags can be used as an alternative.\\t Why Should Plastic Bags be Banned?It’s a fair question. According to different state regulators there are multiple reasons some states are deciding to put these bans in effect, including:The amount of time it takes plastic bags to decomposeDid you know it can take up to 1,000 years for a plastic bag to decompose?The damage it can do to our food sourcesAs plastic breaks down, it makes its way into our water systems—where fish and other sea life consume it, contaminating our food sources with micro-plastics.The difficulty of recycling themPlastic bags are very difficult to recycle; and according to the EPA, around 93 billion plastic bags don’t get recycled each year. In 2018, less than 9% of all used plastics were recycled.The pollution they create, both in the making of plastic bags and in their useSingle-use plastic bags are statistically one of the world’s leading pollutant. A total of 300 million tons of toxic plastic waste is produced every year just in the creation of plastic bags.Many states across the US are looking to ban plastic bags in an attempt to minimize any future pollution that could be created as a result of plastic bag creation and use. Which States are Banning Plastic Bags?The states that have already banned single-used plastic bags include:CaliforniaConnecticutDelawareHawaiiMaineNew YorkOregonVermontNew Jersey","answer":"In some U.S. states, the use of single-use plastic bags has been banned in an effort to reduce plastic pollution.

Best regards,Peter Possum"},{"question":"What are 5 great excercises i can do anywhere to increase my core strength? include how to do them","answer":"Here are five exercises you can do anywhere:1. PlankThe plank is the most renowned exercise that targets your entire core. A plank is an exceptional way to strengthen your abs and your obliques and work your deep muscle to increase your overall stability and power. To perform a plank, start in a pushup position, then move down to rest your weight on your forearms with your hands touching so that your arms can form a V shape. From this position, maintain your straight posture and avoid your stomach sagging. Hold the position for as long as you can. It won't be long before you feel the burn. 2. Side plankPay particular attention to your obliques by performing a side plank as an alternative to a normal plank. Start by getting into a standard plank position. Next, rotate your body so that one side of your body faces the sky. Squeeze your core with one leg straight out and your body stiff in a straight line. Squeeze your core and hold the pose for as long as possible before switching sides. Make sure to try equal lengths on both sides so that you don't get muscle imbalances. 3. Reverse CrunchesCrunches are a great exercise for your core, but this variation adds a slight degree of difficulty if you are finding standard crunches too easy. This exercise works the lower abs, in particular. Start in a standard crunch position, lying down with your knees bent. Keep your hands flat on the ground next to your hips. To perform the exercise, lift your pelvis and knees towards your face. Return to the starting position and repeat as many times as you can. 4. Flutter kicksSometimes the lower abs can get less attention, but flutter kicks can help to address that. This exercise makes sure you strengthen a common area of weakness. Lay flat on the ground with your arms flat and legs stretched out. From here, lift your feet about 6 inches off the ground and hold them there. Once you have done this, start lifting right and left. Lift each leg about a few inches each time. Ensure to maintain good posture and bring each leg to rest before moving to the next. 5. Arms high sit-upsEveryone knows sit-ups, and those who work their abs a lot may be easy by now. This exercise gives your abs a killer workout that they won't forget. It is as easy as starting in a sit-up position. From here, raise your hands straight up to the sky, flatten your hands, and reach for the sky. Now perform a sit-up as you normally would. This is going to be a lot harder than a standard sit-up so make sure your form is correct to achieve maximum results.

Unusually silent -- everyone must be asleep already.Most nights, I’d amuse myself by counting the lights as they went out, or listening to a village mother yelling for her children to come home to bed. I’d pass the time guessing their names, or what they looked like. Tonight though, the villagers must be in bed early. I huff, disappointed. I’m not tired, and being cooped up here alone means that I need to entertain myself. I look around the tower cell for inspiration. I see the single wooden chair and several wide hooks on the ceiling. That’ll work for my idea! Quickly braiding my stupendously long hair, I loop the completed braids through the hook and test it. The hook is firm. I push the unbraided tresses into a soft heap on the other side of the room. Swinging on the braids, like a monkey on a vine, I land in the deep, fluffy pile of hair.  I get back up and swing again. Wheeee!Several hours pass, and I grow tired of that. What else can I do? Suddenly, I remember the sweet sounds of lutes from the village church. I unbraid my hair, and tie the loose ends tightly between two hooks, carefully spacing them.Once they’re up, I pluck one gently. Ping! I tighten and loosen them until they’re perfect.Each hair makes a different sound, and I hum along. Strumming my makeshift instrument, I make a tune. Those villagers won’t be asleep for long!

The 2003 discovery of an early fossil bat from the 52-million-year-old Green River Formation, Onychonycteris finneyi, indicates that flight evolved before echolocative abilities.[20][21] Onychonycteris had claws on all five of its fingers, whereas modern bats have at most two claws on two digits of each hand. It also had longer hind legs and shorter forearms, similar to climbing mammals that hang under branches, such as sloths and gibbons. This palm-sized bat had short, broad wings, suggesting that it could not fly as fast or as far as later bat species. Instead of flapping its wings continuously while flying, Onychonycteris probably alternated between flaps and glides in the air.[7] This suggests that this bat did not fly as much as modern bats, but flew from tree to tree and spent most of its time climbing or hanging on branches.[22] The distinctive features of the Onychonycteris fossil also support the hypothesis that mammalian flight most likely evolved in arboreal locomotors, rather than terrestrial runners. This model of flight development, commonly known as the \\"trees-down\\" theory, holds that bats first flew by taking advantage of height and gravity to drop down on to prey, rather than running fast enough for a ground-level take off.[23][24]","answer":"- The 2003 discovery of an early fossil bat from the 52-million-year-old Green River Formation, Onychonycteris finneyi, indicates that flight evolved before echolocative abilities.- Onychonycteris had claws on all five of its fingers, whereas modern bats have at most two claws on two digits of each hand. - This palm-sized bat had short, broad wings, suggesting that it could not fly as fast or as far as later bat species. - This suggests that this bat did not fly as much as modern bats, but flew from tree to tree and spent most of its time climbing or hanging on branches.- This model of flight development, commonly known as the \\"trees-down\\" theory, holds that bats first flew by taking advantage of height and gravity to drop down on to prey, rather than running fast enough for a ground-level take off."},{"question":"Fire someone by poem in a humorous way.","answer":"Pack your things and clear your deskIt’s time for you to go.You are no longer welcome here --This is the old heave-ho.Pound the pavement, hit the street,You’re fired, you’re canned, you’re sacked,You’re terminated, eight-sixed,Let go, downsized, you’re axed.You’ve been replaced; you’re outta here,Should never have been hired.You’re dismissed, relieved of duties, Deselected, fired!"},{"question":"Write a short story about a fairy that lives in a walnut shell.

They are the heaviest living birds, and lay the largest eggs of any living land animal. With the ability to run at 70 km/h (43.5 mph), they are the fastest birds on land. They are farmed worldwide, with significant industries in the Philippines and Namibia. Ostrich leather is a lucrative commodity, and the large feathers are used as plumes for the decoration of ceremonial headgear. Ostrich eggs have been used by humans for millennia.Ostriches are of the genus Struthio in the order Struthioniformes, part of the infra-class Palaeognathae, a diverse group of flightless birds also known as ratites that includes the emus, rheas, cassowaries and kiwis. There are two living species of ostrich: the common ostrich, native to large areas of sub-Saharan Africa, and the Somali ostrich, native to the Horn of Africa.[2] The common ostrich used to be native to the Arabian Peninsula, and ostriches were present across Asia as far east as Mongolia during the Late Pleistocene and possibly into the Holocene.","answer":"Ostriches are big, flightless birds that are the heaviest species of birds in the world.

Make it super simple and understandable to anyone.","answer":"In the game of football, both teams send out eleven players onto the field. Throughout the game, one team will be on offense, and one will be on defense. The offensive team’s objective is to get the football into the endzone while the defensive team is trying to stop that from happening. The offensive team has four chances, called downs, to move forward 10 yards. If, within those four downs, they do not make it ten yards, the ball is turned over to the other team, and they switch to offense. But if the offensive team does make it ten yards, they get another four downs to get it another ten yards, and this goes on until they hopefully make it across the endzone and score. The ball can be moved by running with it or passing it by throwing it. If the defensive team intercepts the ball, then they take possession and become the offensive team. But if the ball is in the hands of an offensive player, the defensive players can stop them from gaining any more yards by tackling them to the ground. Running or passing the ball over the endzone results in six points for the offensive team, then they have the opportunity to kick the ball through the goal post (the big yellow y-shape post) for one extra point or run it across again for two extra points. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins. "},{"question":"Is this tweet hateful or not hateful? Please explain your judgement in 5 sentences or less.

Use the first-person perspective and place emphasis on survival skills and confusion. Use less than 400 words.","answer":"As morning turned into afternoon, the dew had evaporated, and the sun began to bear down on the grass. It was the first really warm day of the season. The tops of the blades were getting too hot for my taste, so I slunk further down toward the soil. Here, it was shaded and cool. I had just nodded a polite \\"hello\\" to a few ants when an overwhelmingly loud noise started.As a cricket, I know a thing or two about noise and vibration. My legs can create many different notes, and my communication increases or decreases in speed with the temperature, but this noise was constant and monotone. It was louder and closer than any other noise I'd ever heard in my short life, and it was growing even more so.Suddenly, the sun disappeared, and the noise was directly overhead. It caused a tremendous rumble. I slunk down even further into the safety of the tall grass, but the grass appeared to be cut in half! My antennae felt a strong gust, but as quickly as the monster had approached, it retreated. The grass was now barely long enough to cover my body. With the noise still in the distance, I hopped a couple of feet to the side and found longer grass in which to hide.Only a few minutes later, the sound approached again. Once again, I hunkered down to the soil, and the grass above my body was sheered off and shortened. The monster retreated and I moved, again, towards the safety of the longer grass. The afternoon continued in this way for nearly an hour, pushing me into a corner of the yard near the wooden shed. There, I found safety inside a ceramic pot and prayed that the monster only had a taste for grass and not pottery. Soon after, the noise stopped. I assumed the monster had gotten its fill of vegetation. There was a rumble, a rattle, and a clink-- but it seemed the monster had fallen asleep after its extremely large meal. Too scared and exhausted to leave my protective shell, I took a nap to recover enough energy to create a nighttime sonata."},{"question":"I am going to give you a sentence.

Why isn’t one style best?","answer":"The first thing you have to understand is that a positive dihedral (a wing that angles upward from the fuselage) creates roll stability – in other words, it will make the plane less inclined to roll to the left or right. The physics behind this so-called \\"dihedral effect\\" is complicated, but the basics are fairly easy to visualize; a positive dihedral moves the overall center of lift a little higher, placing it closer to – or sometimes above – the aircraft’s total center of mass. Effectively, with enough dihedral effect, the weight is hanging under the force that’s holding it up (as opposed to balancing on top). As you might expect, this sort of stability is often beneficial. You don’t typically want your airliner or cargo plane to flip upside-down, after all. But there are reasons to angle the wing the other way. Oftentimes, when the wing is mounted high, the center of mass is already far below the center of the lift. This can make some roll maneuvers excessively difficult. A negative dihedral angle (often called an anhedral) can reduce this roll resistance to more reasonable levels. Many military cargo aircraft, like the An-124 and C-5, are designed this way.Some planes are built with a dihedral angle that intentionally reduces their roll stability. Though it sounds counterintuitive, fighter aircraft are most maneuverable if they are at least slightly aerodynamically unstable. The proper dihedral angle can help them hit the right balance between stability and instability."},{"question":"Tomorrow at school, we have an assembly where a farmer will be speaking to us.

Please explain your suggestions.  ","answer":"Here are five tips on how to respond to your boss's angry email along with an explanation for each suggestion:- Keep your response brief. Long replies run the risk of being misinterpreted. Pick one major point of contention within his email and respond directly to that. - Organize your thoughts. Don't reply with the first thing that springs to mind. Take a moment to try and understand the root of the issue, including analyzing the situation from your boss's perspective, and ensure your thoughts make sense before you send your reply.  - Be polite. De-escalate the situation by sending a calm and well-mannered reply. Resist the temptation to meet anger with anger as that could make a tense situation even worse. If you remain polite, you increase the likelihood that he will eventually calm down and your conversation can become productive.- Don't be defensive. Your boss is responding with emotion, not reason, so don't give him more justification to be emotional by sending a response that is overly defensive. Instead, appeal to his logic and reason so that you can work together to resolve the issue rather than argue about it. "},{"question":"Please write a poem about my dog, Tifa.

According to a 2021 study conducted by the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, the several post-9/11 wars participated in by the United States in its war against terror have caused the displacement, conservatively calculated, of 38 million people in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Philippines and Pakistan; 11.3 million remain displaced.[55] The study estimated these wars caused the deaths of 897,000 to 929,000 people, including over 364,000 civilians, and cost 8 trillion.[56][57] Critics accuse participating governments of using the \\"war on terror\\" to repress minorities or sideline domestic opponents,[58][59] of mainstreaming Islamophobia,[60] and have criticized negative impacts to health and the environment resulting from it.[61][62][63] Critics assert that the term \\"war\\" is not appropriate in this context (much like the term \\"war on drugs\\") since terror is not an identifiable enemy and it is unlikely that international terrorism can be brought to an end by military means.[64] ","answer":"While many countries, including those that assisted with drone strikes or were involved in drone strikes, supported US action, some critics have alleged that the notion has been used to reduce civil liberties and infringe upon human rights.

He assumes everything can be bought and sold and, when things don’t go his way (as they inevitably don’t in Commedia), he quickly becomes enraged and interferes in the happiness of others.Pantalone controls all the money in Commedia and he becomes terrified when he has to part with any of it. Driven by greed and a lust for wealth, he is stingy in the extreme, and his only ambition is to further his financial interests. Despite his avarice and rapaciousness, the audience sees a petty, unforgiving, cheap and gullible merchant from Venice who is attempting to disguise his age through his ludicrous costume.Pantalone’s role is usually spoken entirely in the Venetian dialect.","answer":"The type of language used to describe Pantalone, a character from La Commedia dell'arte, can be classified as descriptive and evaluative.

The low intelligence of the stupid raccoon makes the animal easy prey for other animals that are normally considered docile and unprovoking, such as rabbits and turtles.The stupid raccoon is a docile, furry little creature that has the same physical appearance and characteristics as that of regular raccoons, but with one notable exception: they are absolutely stupid. Where other animals have the situational awareness and survival skills to scavage for food and shelter, stupid raccoons are unable to feed themselves unless humans put scraps of leftover dinner into plastic garbage bags and put them into garbage receptacles for easy access and consumption. However, while some of these raccoons have easy access to these tasty morsels of leftover food, many of them can become trapped in larger trash bins, becoming stuck and unable to escape back to their natural habitats. These stupid raccoons eventually require human intervention - in the form of a passerby noticing the raccoons inside and lending a helping hand - or they will eventually be transported along with the trash within these receptacles and taken to a nearby landfill where they will die from suffocation underneath thousands of tons of human refuse.Stupid raccoons are living beings that deserve our help, just like any other creature on our beautiful planet. Without intervention, approximately 32,000 are expected to die each year, resulting in a dwindling population that can impact the ecosystem and a lot fewer of these stupid (but cute) animals on the planet. While they are unbelievably dumb creatures, stupid raccoons are also important to our ecosystem. The raccoons provide such vital functions as entertainment for humans, emotional support for ants, and natural garbage disposals for trash.With your donation of just five dollars a minute, we can help round up the stupid raccoon population and put them into safe living areas that will provide them with the opportunity to survive and thrive without falling victim to the harsh environment of the urban world.

An immensely strong, heavy-duty worker of spitz type, the Alaskan Malamute is an affectionate, loyal, and playful but dignified dog recognizable by his well-furred plumed tail carried over the back, erect ears, and substantial bone. The Alaskan Malamute stands 23 to 25 inches at the shoulder and weighs 75 to 85 pounds.

Mals are pack animals. And in your family 'pack,' the leader must be you. If a Mal doesn't respect you, he will wind up owning you instead of the other way around.

Can you give me a list of a few tips I can use to set boundaries with my parents? Include a tip that can help me communicate more clearly with them. ","answer":"I can definitely do that. Here's your list going through tips for setting boundaries with your parents.1. Set boundaries with gratitude and appreciation - It isn't disrespectful to set boundaries, but you should still set them, and your parents should respect them. You can set boundaries and avoid possible hurt feelings by wording what you say carefully and sharing that you appreciate them,2. Be direct - It can be hard to get your parents to recognize that you're independent. This especially goes if you have moved back in with them. You can try to evade possible conflict by not saying anything, But, it's better to share your concerns rather than conceal them.3. Be clear - Being vague also doesn't help. When you set boundaries, you should be clear with your parents. This makes sure that they understand exactly what you mean. If they aren't getting it you can give them examples of things they've done that have upset you and tell them other things they can do instead.4. Compromise - Stating your boundaries can gently remind your parents that you make your own choices. If your boundaries aren't working for them, you should find some sort of compromise. If your parents ask inappropriate questions about your relationships, you can let them know it's okay to chat about your relationships but not go into a territory that's uncomfortable for you. When you find a middle ground, it can make everyone more satisfied with the outcome."},{"question":"Can you write a story for kids about washing up? It should be short enough for a kid to read in under a half hour and include something about germs.","answer":"It was Ginella's bedtime, Mom said. She just finished brushing her teeth and combing her hair. When Mom asked if she washed her hands too, she said yes, even though it wasn't true. Ginella was tired and didn't want to get her hands wet again. Besides, they didn't look dirty. That night, she felt a tickle on her eyelid and rubbed her eyes. In the morning, her right eye was pink, and it hurt. Mom said they had to visit the doctor. The doctor said her eye was infected. He said it had \\"germs\\" that probably came from her hands. He gave her eye drops that stung when they went into Ginella's eyes. She went back to school the next day. Her friends asked what happened, and she told them she had \\"pink eye.\\" That's what the doctor called it. Ginella liked pink, but not in her eye. Miss Clark told her that it was a good time to talk to the class about \\"germs.\\" She brought out a small piece of glass and showed it to the class. Everyone agreed that it looked clean. Then, she got out a cool science tool called a \\"microscope.\\" The teacher said it made very tiny things bigger so people could see them. She put the piece of glass on the microscope. One by one, the students got to look into it. When it was Ginella's turn, she saw little tiny shapes on the glass. Miss Clark said those were \\"germs.\\" Their real names were \\"bacteria.\\" They were tiny things that were alive that were so small you couldn't see them without a microscope.

It is imperative that managers take a proactive approach by implementing comprehensive and more advanced management and scheduling strategies to best prepare for unexpected events, such as surges in work volumes or unscheduled employee time off.  This is where a workforce management solution comes in. A better workforce management strategy focuses on all the activities needed to cost-effectively create and sustain a productive and happy workforce. For this to happen, managers must be able to schedule people optimally for the work available for them to complete. This means having consistent procedures and policies around managing employee time and scheduling, attendance as well as times off.  Naturally, there is optimal scheduling of employees at the service center, ensuring that the right number of employees handle the right amount of work at all times. Advancements in machine learning, computer modeling, and predictive and prescriptive analysis in big data present managers with smarter, more streamlined, and forward-looking approaches to employee scheduling – to replace the traditional, ineffective WFM models. These new approaches and tools present better and more effective ways to handle the everyday complexities that characterize the modern service center.

The letter \\"J\\" evolved from the letter \\"I\\" in the late Middle Ages. Initially, \\"I\\" was used to represent both a vowel and a consonant. Over time, the consonantal form of \\"I\\" started to be written as \\"J\\" to avoid confusion. It wasn't until the 16th century that the distinction between the two letters became widely adopted.On the other hand, \\"U\\" was added to differentiate it from \\"V\\". In Latin, \\"V\\" was used to denote both the \\"u\\" and \\"v\\" sounds, but with the evolution of languages and the introduction of lowercase letters, a need arose to distinguish these sounds. By the late Middle Ages, a rounded form of \\"v\\", which we know as \\"u\\", began to be used to represent the vowel sound, while \\"v\\" was used for the initial consonant sound. However, it wasn't until the mid-17th century that the usage of \\"u\\" and \\"v\\" as distinct letters became standardized in English."},{"question":"What are the basic tools needed to get started sewing?

Understanding of the magnitude of the adaptation challenge at a global scale, however, is incomplete, constrained by a limited understanding of if and how adaptation is taking place. Here we develop and apply a methodology to track and characterize adaptation action; we apply these methods to the peer-reviewed, English-language literature. Our results challenge a number of common assumptions about adaptation while supporting others: (1) Considerable research on adaptation has been conducted yet the majority of studies report on vulnerability assessments and natural systems (or intentions to act), not adaptation actions. (2) Climate change is rarely the sole or primary motivator for adaptation action. (3) Extreme events are important adaptation stimuli across regions. (4) Proactive adaptation is the most commonly reported adaptive response, particularly in developed nations. (5) Adaptation action is more frequently reported in developed nations, with middle income countries underrepresented and low-income regions dominated by reports from a small number of countries. (6) There is limited reporting on adaptations being developed to take advantage of climate change or focusing on women, elderly, or children.","answer":"SummaryPeople will have to change their lifestyles because of climate change.  It is difficult to understand how much of this lifestyle change is happening around the world because we don't know if people are changing their behavior or even how they are changing behavior.  In this study, we are trying to find and describe these lifestyle and behavior changes.  We will compare our findings with the discoveries of other scientific studies.  In some instances, what we have discovered agrees with other scientific studies, but in other cases, it does not.  There have been a lot of studies that focus on how climate change might cause harm to people and their environment, but these studies don't discuss any lifestyle changes.  In addition, climate change is rarely the only reason people change their lifestyles.  Extreme climate change events will help create lifestyle changes in an area.  In more wealthy countries, most lifestyle changes are planned in advance to protect people from the effects of climate change.  Most lifestyle changes in response to climate change are happening in wealthy nations, with lifestyle change reports from middle-income and low-income countries being less common.  There is not much information about lifestyle changes being created to take advantage of the changing climate, and little information exists regarding lifestyle changes that focus on women, children, and the elderly."},{"question":"What are the three stages matter can exist in?

Keep the article around 250 words. Include some helpful information that could give the homeowner clear direction on this topic. You can leave the conclusion. I'll write that.","answer":"All homeowners will have to do their share of cleaning out clogged drains and painting rooms. Often, home repairs are as simple as painting the front door or replacing the bathroom floor. Though these types of repairs can certainly work up a sweat and take up your whole weekend, they are usually pretty straightforward and don’t take a rocket scientist to complete.Occasionally though, you may be faced with repairs that are way beyond your scope of expertise. These days you can find a YouTube video that describes how to complete just about any repair imaginable. There are some areas, however, where you may find it much more beneficial (and safer) to hire a pro.All electrical work should be completed by a licensed electrician. That mindset goes for plumbing as well, except for the occasional leaky faucet or clogged drain. Rewiring or re-plumbing a whole house is not only a huge undertaking, but most cities require that this scope of work be completed by a licensed pro in accordance with city codes and permits. That way, your city can set a certain standard for the whole community so that your family can feel safe knowing that all the houses on the block had to pass inspection on their electrical wiring, plumbing, and building specifications. Do some research to find several reputable companies. It’s pretty easy to find out if an electrician, plumber, or builder has gotten bad feedback from past customers to determine if they're worth your time."},{"question":"Hey there.

I was crushed.With nothing else to do, I went to drink at my favorite bar. It was a small hole-in-the-wall place, and I met a woman there. We drank together, and she listened to my complaints.

I was already drunk, so I just did as she told me. It didn't make a difference to me. She cheered me up and reminded me that I was feeling depressed over a piece of trash that was cheating on me and called me a wallet. A few weeks after that, I met Haruka at the same bar again.

When Elizabeth Alexandra Mary, the elder daughter of Prince Albert, Duke of York, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, was born on April 21, 1926, she apparently had little chance of assuming the throne, as her father was a younger son of King George V.But in late 1936, her uncle, King Edward VIII, abdicated to marry an American divorcée, Wallis Simpson. As a result, her father became King George VI, and 10-year-old “Lilibet” (as she was known within the family) became the heir presumptive to the throne.Though she spent much of her childhood with nannies, Princess Elizabeth was influenced greatly by her mother, who instilled in her a devout Christian faith as well as a keen understanding of the demands of royal life. Her grandmother, Queen Mary, consort of King George V, also instructed Elizabeth and her younger sister Margaret in the finer points of royal etiquette.Educated by private tutors, with an emphasis on British history and law, the princess also studied music and learned to speak fluent French. She trained as a Girl Guide (the British equivalent of the Girl Scouts) and developed a lifelong passion for horses.As queen, she kept many thoroughbred racehorses and frequently attended racing and breeding events. Elizabeth’s famous attachment to Pembroke Welsh corgis also began in childhood, and she owned more than 30 corgis over the course of her reign.","answer":"Queen Elizabeth's nickname was Lilibet, and she liked Pembroke Welsh corgis.

Somehow, she had succeeded but didn't quite see how she had earned her success.The afternoon had been crawling along. The energy of the day matched the thick blanket of low, grey clouds that coated everything in cold, persistent rain.

Eisenhower created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) by signing the National Aeronautics and Space Act on July 29, 1958. Assets and research programs previously administrated by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) were transferred to NASA as part of the act.The creation of NASA was a response to the USSR's launch of a series of Sputnik satellites. The USSR launched the first Sputnik satellite on October 4, 1957. This launch is generally recognized as the start of the Space Age. It also officially began the Space Race between the USSR and the United States of America.The United States of America initially saw NASA and the Space Race as a matter of national security. Whoever controlled space would have the high ground in the event of a conflict. At the time, the USSR and USA were locked in the Cold War, a political and ideological rivalry between the two superpowers.NASA was given the task of developing the space capabilities of the United States, including creating the capacity to launch living organisms and hardware into space. Early efforts to launch organisms into space included launching two monkeys named Able and Baker on a suborbital flight on May 28, 1959. Both monkeys survived, though Able died two years later and Baker spent most of her life on display after the flight. NASA's Mercury Program also launched chimpanzees on test flights before sending astronauts.During the 1960s and 1970s, NASA conducted the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and Skylab programs, which taught many valuable lessons about conducting space missions that it still uses. Apollo sent crews to the Moon for the first time during the late 1960s and early 1970s.While the Cold War ended with the collapse of the USSR, NASA continues to conduct scientific research in space and conduct its crewed space programs. It is currently a partner in the International Space Station and is preparing to return astronauts to the Moon with the Artemis Program."},{"question":"Write a 2 verse and chorus  lullaby song about a Camel walking on a magical beach, searching for hidden treasure","answer":"(Verse 1)Camel, Camel, walks so slow,On a beach where magic grows,Searching for treasure and a friend,To be kind to, until the end,(Chorus)Camel, Camel, sway with grace,Whispers guide you in this place.On the beach, where dreams are found,Relax and let go, worries unbound.(Verse 2)Footprints in the sand appear,Leading Camel, no need to fear.Stars twinkle, shining so bright,Guiding through dreams, day and night.(Chorus)Camel, Camel, sway with grace,Whispers guide you in this place.On the beach, where dreams are found,Relax and let go, worries unbound."},{"question":"In this article, what percent of daily fluids come from drinks as opposed to food?These recommendations cover fluids from water, other beverages and food.

For first-time owners, the pet choice will depend on their interests, budget, and resources, as well as what kind of animal they feel comfortable with. Here are a few animals perfect for first-time pet owners:1. Dogs: Dogs are the ideal choice for most animal lovers. Although dogs can be a handful and they can take a fair amount of time to train, there's no doubt that they're loyal and wonderful companions. Golden retrievers and poodles are good breeds for first-time owners as they're generally easy to take care of.2. Cats: A beloved icon of the pet world, cats are known to be quite independent and extroverted as they can easily stroll around the neighborhood and find their way back to you. Take note that cats use litter boxes so you have to clean up after them regularly.3. Hamsters: If you're looking for something small and manageable, hamsters are the perfect pet choice for you. They're usually harmless and easy to maintain with no risk of aggressive behavior or unhealthy habits.4. Rats: Although rats can be intimidating for most people, they make great pets as long as you treat them gently and carefully. They do have some defense mechanisms that you'll have to get used to, but they're generally pretty calm and friendly creatures that you can easily get along with.5. Fish: Fish can make great pets as long as you maintain a safe boundary for them. Their tank or aquarium should be well-built, regularly cleaned, and placed at a suitable location where it doesn't easily fall over. Overall, owning a pet is a great way to showcase your passion for nature and wildlife, while giving you a fulfilling sense of attachment and responsibility. It's best to explore your options and determine what kind of pet would be best suitable for your house."},{"question":"1.

Make the love interest a handsome man who is doing quality assurance for the improvement of the department and causes the female to be awkward and clumsy because she is attracted to him. Keep it under 400 words.","answer":"Hollis walked into the room and naturally, I turned into a clumsy tangle of arms and legs. I have always thought of myself as mostly put-together and cool. I mean I never fall for the lines some guys use to get dates. In fact, I have a pretty decent dating life. Safe, fun, and responsible. Just how I like it.So, I was totally unprepared for Hollis swaggering into my life. It didn’t help that he looked like a model from one of those top fashion magazines. Those guys are airbrushed into perfection. Hollis isn’t airbrushed. He’s…just perfection. I mean alpha male, stubbled chin, solid muscle with a few scars here and there perfection.Of course, Hollis headed straight toward me. The best thing I could do was to just keep breathing. This was ridiculous. He wasn’t coming over to ask me out. He had his clipboard in his hand. He was getting information about the new IT department. The one I was in charge of. He was the QA guy. I needed to get a handle on my hormones. It was like some lovestruck teenager had hijacked my brain.“Hey, Beck,” he murmured in his smoother than silk sheets voice.“Hi!” My own voice cracked and shrilled. Definitely not smooth. And my face heated up until I knew even my ears were probably bright red. He held out the clipboard. “I’ve got the suggestions we talked about here.”In a perfect world, I would give him a dazzling smile and whisk him and his clipboard away into my office for some alone time. In this world, I reached for the clipboard, missed by inches, watched it clatter onto the floor, and then stumbled forward as I made a clumsy grab for it. But not before Hollis also bent to catch it, and we banged our heads together. By the time we were both standing up again, and Hollis had the clipboard clutched safely in his hand, I could hear people snickering around us.So, yeah, I had managed to practically knock out the guy who had make-or-break control over my shiny new IT department, the one I had poured hours of energy into, in order to impress the company bosses.

Rollmops are a bit of a delicacy and are not enjoyed in many places around the world. If you try to break down the word for yourself, may conjure up an image of a special type of cleaning instrument in your head. However, this is far from what a rollmop is. In this article, we will talk about what rollmops are and where they originated from. What Are Rollmops?A rollmop is a unique food that consists of pickled herring fillets that have been rolled into a cylindrical shape, stuffed with fillings, and fastened together with skewers before being stored in brine. Rollmop fillings typically include vegetables such as onion, pickled cucumber, and pitted green olives stuffed with pimento peppers. The brine that rollmops are stored in traditionally contains water, vinegar, and salt, but can also contain a variety of other additives. These optional extras include sugar or other sweeteners, raw onion slices, peppercorns, and mustard seeds.Where Did Rollmops Originate From?The name ‘rollmop’ is German in origin, making it friendly for many English speakers. This food has been a staple in countries in Northern Europe since the medieval period. It also had a spark in popularity in Germany in the early 19th century and is currently served as part of a traditional German hangover breakfast.Currently, rollmops are eaten in parts of Europe, South America, the United States, and Canada. Rollmops are also unbelievably popular in present-day Czechia and Slovakia.ConclusionRollmops are not a food that will be suited to everyone’s tastes. Especially for those who do not enjoy seafood, vinegar, or pickled vegetables, this dish may seem very offputting. However, if you’ve never tried pickled herring, we encourage you to give rollmops a try! Although it may be a little bit of an adventurous choice, those who like to try new foods and experience new cultures can find everything they need and more in a simple rollmop."},{"question":"I'm posting a picture of my 17 year old daughter, Jo at her senior prom.

Switch to LED Lights Although LED lights may cost more than traditional light bulbs, they will help you save tons of money on your energy costs over time. Switching to LED bulbs is an excellent way to conserve energy and save on your electric bill. LED lights will not just help you save on your energy bill, but they can also help you save money on your overall lighting costs since they last at least 25 times longer than traditional bulbs. That means you will not need to replace your light bulbs as often. 2. Do Not Leave Your Refrigerator Door Open We all look inside our fridge as we decide what we want to eat. But did you know that doing so can cause you to waste a lot of energy? It takes more time for your refrigerator to cool back down after the doors have been open for several minutes. To eliminate this extra cost, try deciding on what you want to eat before you open your fridge doors to help reduce the amount of energy used. 3. Keep Your Oven Door Closed If you frequently open your oven door while cooking, it will take twice as long to get back to the cooking temperature. Instead of opening your oven door all the time, consider using an oven light if your oven has a window on the door that allows you to peek inside. 4. Shut Down your Electronics One of the easiest things you can do to help save on energy costs is to shut down your electronics when they are not in use. We all tend to leave our devices such as our TV and laptop on making it more convenient than waiting for it to boot up again. But leaving your devices on while they are not in use can contribute to your high energy costs. When we leave devices plugged into an outlet, they are still using power. This is something known as \\"phantom power\\". To help reduce your energy use and costs, try connecting everything to a power bar and turning that off whenever you leave the house. 5. Decrease Energy Use During Peak Hours These days, many homes are now equipped with smart meters that keep track of when you are using the most energy throughout the day. If you are interested in conserving energy, you should use most of your electricity during non-peak hours. By doing so, you will save as much as 10 cents per kilowatt. 6. Make Use of Small Appliances If you are cooking a small meal, you will want to make good use of your smaller appliances instead of firing up your large electric oven. Toaster ovens, electric skillets, air fryers, and other countertop appliances are now versatile enough to help you create a full-course meal without using a ton of energy. 7. Wash Laundry in Cold Water Only If you have any delicate items in your wardrobe, you may already know about the benefits of washing your clothes in cold water. Doing so can help your clothing last longer and the fabric is less likely to shrink. Another great benefit of using cold water while doing laundry is that it will help keep your electricity bill low. It is estimated that as much as 90% of the energy used by your washing machine is spent on heating your water. Therefore, many consumers have caught on to the benefits of using cold water to wash their laundry.

Several Native American groups originally inhabited the region today known as Wyoming. The Crow, Arapaho, Lakota, and Shoshone were but a few of the original inhabitants European explorers encountered when they first visited the region. What is now southwestern Wyoming was claimed by the Spanish Empire, which extended through the Southwest and Mexico. With Mexican independence in 1821, it was considered part of Alta California. U.S. expansion brought settlers who fought for control. Mexico ceded these territories after its defeat in 1848 in the Mexican–American War.From the late 18th century, French-Canadian trappers from Québec and Montréal regularly entered the area for trade with the tribes. French toponyms such as Téton and La Ramie are marks of that history.American John Colter first recorded a description in English of the region in 1807. He was a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which was guided by French Canadian Toussaint Charbonneau and his young Shoshone wife, Sacagawea.

What exactly is this kind of seaweed? I’m particularly interested if it’s safe to swim in or not. I am also curious as to what causes unusually large masses of it.","answer":"Sargassum seaweed is a type of brown algae that is found in salty ocean waters. In appearance, it has leafy appendages and berry-like structures on branches. The “berries” are gas-filled with oxygen and are referred to as “pneumatocysts.” This “seaweed” floats in clumps and “rafts” can stretch for many miles across the ocean. Since it floats, sargassum provides food and breeding grounds to many marine animals like fish, sea turtles, birds, and shrimp. Mahi Mahi fish in particular use the seaweed masses as a breeding ground. It could also be providing food for deep-water fish because once the sargassum loses buoyancy, it sinks to the sea floor.The problems that arise with this type of seaweed is that it builds up along beach shores and emits a gas that reeks of rotten eggs. The rotting grass emits hydrogen sulfide, which is toxic to humans and may cause respiratory issues. The leaves themselves contain arsenic, which is incredibly harmful if ingested or used for fertilizer. Therefore, humans should avoid large quantities of seaweed on the shoreline and also avoid swimming through masses of it.Scientists are unsure what causes sargassum seaweed to bloom in larger than normal amounts. Algae growth is affected by sea currents and thrives on rich nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. Human activities like fossil fuel production can dump these wastes into rivers which feed the oceans. So if these levels are elevated in a particular year, then it is likely the seaweed could be more abundant."},{"question":"How is coffee processed after it is picked up until it reaches the store? Make it a numbered list with a brief explanation about each step, and write them in sentences. Add in a short intro explaining where the coffee plant is native to and when it was first cultivated.","answer":"The coffee plant, Coffea arabica, is thought to originate from other forests of South Sudan and Ethiopia in Africa. Coffee roasting and cultivation is thought to have originated in Yemen in the middle of the 15th century. To go from harvest to being ready to brew and drink, the freshly picked coffee beans need to go through several steps. 1. Once harvested, the fruit (called a coffee cherry) is dried to around 11% moisture. In many places, the cherries are left in the dry sun for several weeks. 2. After drying, the coffee beans are then hulled, or polished to remove the thin, silvery, outer coating and sorted by size and weight before being shipped around the world.3. The coffee is roasted once it arrives at its destination which usually occurs at temperatures around 550 degrees Fahrenheit before being quickly cooled and sent to consumers. 4. Roasted beans are now ground down to different grades depending on how it is going to be made into coffee. 5. The final step is to use the ground coffee to brew yourself a fresh cup and enjoy.

Budgeting - this is extremely helpful in gaining an idea of your income and where you're money is going. It will also help you lay out any short or long-term goals you would have regarding your finances. A good rule to follow when it comes the budgeting is known as the 50/30/20 rule. What this means is you should allocate 50% of your after-tax income to expenses you consider essential, then you would want to allocate 30% to the things you want such as amenities in the last 20% should go towards your savings. 2. Financial safety net - this practice will allow you to have money set aside for emergencies. Doing this will allow you to not rely on using a credit card for paying for major unexpected expenses. It's common practice to save about three to six months of your current living expenses to build that emergency fund.3. Paying existing debts - existing debt can be a major contributing factor to the drain on your finances especially when faced with high interest rates. It's a good idea to make a plan to know how long realistically it would take you to pay off any loans or debt you may have. Cards that have the highest interest rates are the ones you're going to want to prioritize making extra payments on. You'll want to make sure you're only charging what you're capable of paying each month.

It should give some general facts about the collider and be written from the point of view of someone who knows a bit about it, but is not an expert. Make sure to include the length of the tunnel in the facts. Give me at least 3 paragraphs worth of information about it. Each paragraph should be no more than 5 sentences long. Make the total length of information about the Large Hadron Collider more than 250 words.","answer":"Do any of you know about the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)? I was aware of it previously, but I didn't look into it until today. This thing's pretty amazing, so let me tell you about it. It's a particle accelerator, and its job is to smash tiny particles together. It's built inside a huge underground tunnel that's 27 kilometers long. The tunnel is a closed loop though, it's not just a tunnel that goes 27 km away from the starting point.The collider uses magnets and other arrangements to accelerate particles to nearly the speed of light. At this point, the particles are put on a collision course with each other and ultimately collide. The magnets I referred to previously have to be kept at a temperature of ‑271.3°C. There are thousands of magnets in the collider, so it makes sense it's a long loop.One thing that's amazing about the LHC is the precision with which it operates. It has to collide tiny particles into each other, so you can imagine trying to shoot two needles at each other from 10km apart and trying to make them collide — it's no easy task! The collider is operated by the wonderful people at the CERN Control Centre, and I'd encourage you all to learn more. I know I certainly plan on reading more about this amazing feat of engineering in the future."},{"question":"Can you write a silly short story about the planets in our solar system?

Scott Fitzgerald.Amory Blaine, a young Midwesterner, is convinced that he has an exceptionally promising future. He attends a posh college-preparatory school and later Princeton University. He grows estranged from his eccentric mother Beatrice and becomes the protégé of Monsignor Thayer Darcy, a Catholic priest. During his sophomore year at Princeton, he returns to Minneapolis over Christmas break and encounters Isabelle Borgé, a wealthy, young debutante whom he first met as a boy. They embark upon a romantic relationship.While at Princeton, he deluges Isabelle with letters and poems, but she becomes disenchanted with him due to his incessant criticism. After his prom, they break up on Long Island. Following their separation, Amory graduates from his alma mater and enlists in the United States Army amid World War I. He is shipped overseas to serve in the trenches of the Western front. While overseas, he learns his mother Beatrice has died and most of his family's wealth has been lost due to a series of failed investments.After the armistice with Imperial Germany, Amory settles in New York City as it undergoes the birth pangs of the Jazz Age. He becomes infatuated with a cruel and narcissistic flapper named Rosalind Connage. Desperate for a job, Amory is hired by an advertising agency, but he detests the work. Due to his poverty, his relationship with Rosalind deteriorates as she prefers a rival suitor, Dawson Ryder, a man of wealth and status. A distraught Amory quits his job and goes on an alcoholic bender for three weeks until the start of prohibition in the United States.When Amory travels to visit an uncle in Maryland, he meets Eleanor Savage, an 18-year-old atheist. Eleanor chafes under the religious conformity and gender limitations imposed on her by contemporary society in Wilsonian America. Amory and Eleanor spend a lazy summer conversing about their love. On their final night together before Amory must return to New York City, Eleanor attempts suicide in order to prove her disbelief in any deity, and Amory realizes that he does not love her.Returning to New York, Amory learns that the fickle Rosalind is engaged to be married to his affluent rival Dawson Ryder. A devastated Amory is further dispirited to learn that his beloved mentor Monsignor Darcy has died. Homeless, Amory wanders from New York City to his alma mater Princeton and, accepting a car ride from a wealthy man driven by a resentful chauffeur, he speaks out in favor of socialism—although he admits he is still formulating his thoughts as he is talking.Concluding his long argument about their time's political and societal problems, Amory emphasizes his disillusionment with the current era. He announces his hope to stand alongside those who would bring forth fundamental changes to the age. The men in the car denounce his views, but upon learning that one of them was the father to one of his old friends at Princeton and that the son had died in World War I, Amory and the man reconcile, acknowledging mutual respect. It dawns on Amory that his time as a young promising Princetonian man has all been but a wasted dream, and he parts ways with his travel mates amicably.Continuing his lonesome walk towards Princeton, Amory gradually forsakes the final obsessions about times and people that once constituted fundamental ideologies of his old self. Standing alone and musing at the sight of Princeton's gothic towers, Amory ecstatically yet somberly concludes: \\"I know myself . . . but that is all.\\"","answer":"Amory Blaine is my protagonist, a young Midwesterner who knows that he has a future full of potential. Who might that remind you of? He goes to Princeton. As time passes and with distance my protagonist becomes alienated from his mother. He becomes supported and guided by Monsignor Thayer Darcy, a Catholic priest. Upon return home from Princeton over Christmas break my character crosses paths with Isabelle Borgé. I wrote her to be a wealthy, upper-class, and fashionable young thing who first met Amory during youth. A romance develops.Amory returns to Princeton and they correspond through letters and poems. I wrote in my novel that she soon became disappointed and disillusioned. My characters break up on Long Island after prom. My protagonist graduates and then is off to the Army during World War I. I wrote him to be shipped to the Western front. I also wrote that the mother dies and all inheritance is gone. Amory learns this while overseas.Our protagonist returns to US soil and resides in New York, set in the early stages of The Jazz Age. I had to write into the plot a hateful Rosalind Connage, full of conceit and self-love. Our boy Amory is looking for a job and ends up at an advertising agency where he is ill-suited. Rosalind prefers the money of a rival suitor along with his status. Our poor boy can't compete. Amory quits his job and goes on a three-week binge fueled by alcohol and despair.I have our boy then go to Maryland to visit an uncle. I then introduce the character of Eleanor Savage, an 18-year-old atheist. She finds her community, gender roles, and religion too restrictive. Our boy and Eleanor spend their time doing little else besides talking about their romance. To make things interesting I have to add a suicide attempt by Eleanor. Amory comes to his senses at this and realizes that he couldn't love her.Upon our boy's return to New York, he learns that Rosalind is engaged and that his dearly loved mentor Monsignor Darcy has died. Amory wanders as a hopeless homeless person to Princeton catching a car ride from a wealthy man driven by a bitter chauffeur. He takes this time to share his political thoughts and develop them as he is speaking.He lists his objections about society's current state peppered with disappointment in an ongoing argument. He hopes to be one along with others to bring about necessary reform to the important issues of his time. The wealthy man who offered Amory a ride along with his chauffeur reject the view held by our protagonist. I wrote for them to part peaceably after learning that Amory knew the man's son from Princeton. The man's son had died in the war.On a deserted walk toward Princeton, our boy comes to terms with all of his ideologies and obsessions and abandons them. I end my novel with our protagonist standing deserted.

I had imagined strolling along the Seine, admiring the Eiffel Tower, exploring the Louvre, and tasting the famous croissants and macarons. But when I finally got there, I realized that Paris was nothing like I had expected. It was a huge letdown.First of all, the city was crowded and noisy. There were tourists everywhere, pushing and shoving to get a glimpse of the monuments and museums. The lines were long and the tickets were expensive. I had to wait for hours to get into the Musée d’Orsay, only to find out that half of the paintings were on loan or under restoration. The Arc de Triomphe was surrounded by traffic and pollution, and the view from the top was not worth the climb.Secondly, the city was dirty and smelly. There was trash on the streets, graffiti on the walls, and dog poop on the sidewalks. The metro was dark and dingy, and the trains were often delayed or canceled. The hotels were small and shabby, and the beds were uncomfortable. The bathrooms were tiny and moldy, and the showers were either scalding or freezing.Thirdly, the city was rude and unfriendly. The locals were snobbish and arrogant, and they looked down on me for not speaking French. They rolled their eyes when I asked for directions or menus in English, and they ignored me when I said hello or thank you. The waiters were slow and surly, and they charged me extra for water or bread. The shopkeepers were pushy and dishonest, and they tried to rip me off with high prices or fake products.I was so disappointed by Paris that I decided to cut my trip short and go back home. I felt like I had wasted my time and money on a city that did not live up to its reputation. I realized that Paris was not for me, and that I would never return.

Avoiding her, I map the house.I learn about the man -- my enemy. I learn his patterns and his habits. Every morning is the same. Every evening is mostly the same.

Include Chicago landmarks and escaping from his home at The Wilds Conservation and Preserve","answer":"There was once an adventurous aardvark named Ardel who loved to explore new places. He was very eager to wander and explore, his name even meant eager in Latin! He often escaped and led the staff on multi-day aardvark searches. He had become a bit of a celebrity for his antics. So, one day when Ardel stumbled upon the smallest of holes in the enclosure fencing, it was no surprise that away he went. But Ardel wandered too far from home this time and found himself in a strange new place - Chicago! He had never seen anything like the tall buildings and bright lights before. As he wandered around the city, he felt new emotions - he was lost and scared. But then he saw something kind of familiar - a statue of a cow! It was the famous Cow on Parade statue and reminded him of home. This made him relax a bit and Ardel explored the city for hours. He came across many of the famous landmarks in Chicago, like a cool shiny ball, the Willis Tower, and the colorful Navy Pier. He even stopped by to visit some of the animals at the Lincoln Park Zoo. But as the days passed, Ardel started to feel homesick. He missed his cozy burrow and the warm sun of The Wilds. He longed to return home.Ardel grabbed a piece of delicious Chicago-style pizza (they didn't have termite flavored) and wandered over to the Shedd Aquarium to think. Watching the penguins frolic in the Oceanarium relaxed him. While he was there, a kind family noticed him and they took him in and gave him a warm place to stay. They wanted to get him home to Africa but called The Wilds Preserve for some advice. They found out that Ardel was from there! So the kind family took Ardel back to The Wilds. He said goodbye and knew he'd never forget his adventure in Chicago. It was nice being surrounded by familiar sights and sounds of the preserve.As he looked back on his adventure, he realized that though he had been lost and scared, he learned a valuable lesson - that kindness and friendship can be found all around us, even in those who are very different from us.The end - for now.

Pull out this rosé at your next weekend barbecue, and prepare to feel popular. A lesson in balance, this highly aromatic blend from Goose Ridge in Washington State delivers bright berry fruit and refreshing acidity, followed by a creamy finish. 2. Cooler weather doesn’t have to mean kissing your favorite crisp whites goodbye. Weighty enough to hold its own alongside rich foods and warming enough to deserve a place on your holiday table, this bottle is the perfect cool-weather white. Made from the lesser-known Greek white variety Aidani, expect notes of earthy sage and fennel alongside aromas of flint and struck matches. 3. Craving red wine on a hot summer day? Say hello to this porch sipper. A 90 percent carbonically macerated red blend, it’s highly chillable, with notes of rooibos tea, bright cherries, and a drizzle of balsamic. The sustainably grown melange includes Nebbiolo, Primitivo, Syrah, Tempranillo, and more. On the palate, sweet fruity notes take a backseat to structured tannins, keeping everything in balance.4. A sip of Grecian history, Mylonas Rosé offers a unique blend of two native grapes: Malagousia and Mandilaria. The resulting wine boasts slightly earthy flavors, with accents of honeysuckle and Camembert rind. This bottle especially shines alongside food, from green salads to cheese plates. 5. Think all red blends taste the same? Think again. Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, and Petit Verdot combine to create distinct, structured notes of juicy strawberries and freshly cracked black pepper in this stellar bottling. Prominent tannins make for a slightly drying palate, but well-integrated fruit and acid keep things ultra-drinkable. Far from homogenized, this unique Napa Valley melange highlights how complex and well balanced red blends can be.6. With ripe berries, cream aromas, and vibrant acidity, it’s not hard to see why rosés made from Pinot Noir continue to gain traction in the States. From Oregon’s Willamette Valley, home to some of the country’s best Pinot Noirs, Stoller Family Estate’s take on pink wine is juicy and refreshing, with enough complexity to grip the palate and pique your interest. 7. Equally as fun as it is “serious,” this chillable red is a definite crowd-pleaser. It’s from Burgenland, a region in eastern Austria known for its full-bodied reds. For the Gamay lover looking to expand their horizons, this cool kid-approved bottle offers juicy, jammy vibes via an unexpected grape blend: Zweigelt and St. Laurent. A subtly tannic, slightly peppery red, it offers just enough sweetness to keep you coming back for the next sip. 8. A supple Dolcetto that drinks like a highly expressive Merlot, this soft and juicy red is bursting with aromas of ripe blackberries, damp soil, and blueberry jam. From Massolino, a winery that’s been producing high-quality releases in Italy’s Piedmont region since 1896, this bottling is well structured and drinks like high-end Bordeaux blend, making its 20 price tag even more of a welcome surprise.9. Bernard Baudry’s Chinon Les Granges arrives on the savory end of the red wine spectrum. Wafts of roasted red peppers and a bright hint of capsicum deliver everything we seek in Chinon, and more. The family-owned winery grows grapes across 79 acres in the famous Loire Valley appellation, producing a range of terroir-driven Cabernet Francs and Chenin Blancs. This wine was made to be drunk young and paired with aromatic, meaty meals like spaghetti bolognese or herb-crusted rack of lamb. 10. Crafted as an homage to Madame Clicquot, who famously stated, “Our black grapes give the finest white wine,” the La Grande Collection is Veuve Clicquot’s celebration of the Pinot Noir grape in all of its elegance. A blend of 90 percent Pinot Noir and 10 percent Chardonnay grapes from eight of Veuve Clicquot’s historic grand crus, this bottle has an aging potential of 15 years. Rich brioche notes emerge on the palate without overpowering subtle tropical candied pineapple aromas. On the palate, fine effervescence and stunning acidity keep things light and mineral-driven. This is a lively and highly age-worthy bubbly that’s sure to make any occasion feel special.11. A celebration of an extremely versatile native Greek grape, this bubbly pink wine is as easy on the palate as it is on the eyes. From the tiny town of Amyndeon in the Macedonia region, Kir-Yanni’s sparkling rosé is made from 100 percent Xinomavro, resulting in an ultra-vibrant, almost red hue that nears that of Lambrusco. A refreshing sip with notes of strawberries and hints black licorice, this sub-20 sparkler is fruit-forward with high acidity and a faint perception of sweetness on the palate. Its active bubbles tickle the tongue and keep the wine light, bright, and ripe for fried food pairings.

What are six ways that I can rev my brain and be more “awake” in the am?","answer":"Not everyone is an early bird, but many night owls still have AM responsibilities. Here are six ways to rev up your brain to feel more alert and attentive in the mornings when it’s hard to get out of bed! 1. Take a cold shower with revitalizing scents to jolt your nervous system! Most people don’t want to get out of the warm embrace of their blankets, so a cold shower may take time to work up to. The cold water is an immediate wake-up call to your nervous system, but a lukewarm shower with revitalizing scents in shampoo and body wash can be just as effective. The best scents for alertness are spicy or have citrus notes, such as orange, cinnamon, rosemary, and peppermint. 2. Avoid the allure of sugary cereals and other sweet breakfast foods. While it may be tempting to grab a doughnut and a Frappuccino on the way to work, resist the urge. Sweet breakfasts will increase your blood sugar, which can make you feel alert for a few hours before a hard crash of fatigue in the afternoon. Stick to a hearty, healthy breakfast with protein and heart-healthy fats instead. Eggs and bacon are a classic, but you could also blend a smoothie, have a slice of avocado toast, or opt for rolled oats with berries and a glass of whole milk. 3. Drink a glass of ice-cold water before your morning cup of coffee. Many people can’t wait to have their cup of coffee in the mornings but steer clear until you’ve awakened your mind and body with a cold glass of water. Dehydration is a common cause of fatigue, so a glass of cold water will refresh your nervous system to get you moving in the AM. 4. Listen to something upbeat, like a comedic, engaging podcast or your favorite “get up and go” music. Putting yourself in a good “go-getter” mood will help you awaken your senses in the mornings. Upbeat music or laughter are both great ways to help you feel more alert and prepped to take on the day. 5. Stretch and work out fatigue with a quick walk outdoors. Not only will a good stretch and regular exercise help you sleep better, but a quick stroll outdoors in the morning is a change of scenery that tells your body and mind that it’s time to wake up for the day. Slow stretches work out kinks that accumulate in muscles while asleep.6. Allow natural sunlight to permeate your surroundings in the mornings. This one may make you groan with dread, but sunshine suppresses melatonin production within your body. Melatonin is the chemical that makes you sleepy, and that’s encouraged in dark environments. Standing in sunlight for a few minutes after you wake up tells your mind and body that the day is getting started.

Talk about the health concerns of nanoparticles and that some studies suggest possible carcinogenic effects. Also mention other health related problems linked to it, and discuss the ingredients they usually have. Keep the response under 400 words.","answer":"Nanoparticles – used in cosmetics such as toothpaste, lipstick, or deodorant – are tiny particles over a thousand times thinner than the diameter of a human hair. For example, the pigments titanium oxide and zinc oxide are used in sunscreens and stay like a film on the skin to reflect sunlight.That all sounds positive at first, but the nanoparticles in cosmetics are controversial. Their effect on humans and the environment has not yet been adequately researched, and many meaningful studies have not been conducted. How tiny nanoparticles used in cosmetic products affect our health is completely unclear.Studies by the Federal Environment Agency on nanoparticles suggest a possible carcinogenic effect of some nanomaterials. These may include carbon nanotubes or titanium dioxide, which should be taken seriously.Many cosmetic products also contain nanoparticles. Silver nanoparticles in deodorants have antibacterial properties. Other types of particles in creams and lotions help the skincare products get absorbed into the skin more easily. Toothpaste with nanoparticles fills the finest cracks in the teeth. Kohl pencils and mascaras have a longer shelf life, thanks to nanoparticles.Nanoparticles don't get through the skin if it is healthy. However, they can get into the blood via the respiratory tract. At the beginning of the year, scientists from the Center for Medical Biotechnology shared initial findings on how nanoparticles could influence our stomach and intestinal flora. According to this, nanoparticles can bind to harmful and beneficial bacteria, including probiotic germs.The immune system can recognize pathogenic bacteria more poorly when covered with nanoparticles. It promotes intestinal inflammation. Certain nanoparticles weaken the infectivity of the Helicobacter pylori germ involved in the development of gastric cancer."},{"question":"How many types of Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs) are there?","answer":"The CRT has been a dominant electronic information display unit for over 50 years. The displays used are available in two configurations:    • Monochrome: These are CRTs used by measuring instruments such as oscilloscopes and high-resolution medical monitors. Also known as single-color CRTs, monochrome CRTs use electrostatic deflection, which scans an electron beam across the screen.    • Color CRTs: These tubes have three electron beams deflecting magnetically and impinging on three color-producing rays. These tubes help produce images and are most common in computer monitors and televisions."},{"question":"Create a sonnet about the sadness the last bite of ice cream causes.","answer":"My sweet, frozen cream, once my true delight,Oh, the last bite, my heart begins to sink,Sorrow leaves me feeling it's just not right,That last bite is gone, it's so fast - in a blink.In my last final taste, I sense it's the end,The last moment is wonderful and rare,Such fleeting joy that I comprehendIs now vanished, leaving behind despair.They say all good things must come to an end,Oh, but why not a little longer still,Fate so cruel, rob me of my tasty friend,Leave me with such vast emptiness to fill.Alone I sit, tears streaming down my face,Forlorn, dreaming of ice cream's final trace."},{"question":"Write an ad for my new invisibility cloak I am selling that is made of leprechaun hair.","answer":"Introducing the revolutionary new Invisibility Cloak made of 100% genuine Leprechaun Hair!Are you tired of trying to sneak around unnoticed, or do you wish you could disappear when the situation calls for it?

The article will focus on his career and the impact of steroids. Make it retrospective and pose the question of steroid use as a question of intrigue.","answer":"One of the league's most dominant all-time hitters, Barry Bonds has a career surrounded by controversy. Despite being one of the league's all-time home run leaders, Bonds has struggled to make his way into the Hall of Fame. As with many other great power hitters, Bonds' career is now shrouded in the controversy of steroid usage. Other notable names to have steroids cloud their reputation include sluggers Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, and Alex Rodrigues. It is a tough position for Hall of Fame voters and fans alike as they try to separate their feelings about steroids from the players' careers. In his time in the majors, Bonds slugged 762 homers at a .298 average. It is undoubted that Barry Bonds is one of, if not the best, hitter of all time. By all accounts, he should be in the Hall of Fame. His stats are truly remarkable, and we may never see another batter who dominated the game in the way that he did. But should all concerns about steroids be thrown out the window? This article will dive into the career of Bonds as well as the controversy that now surrounds it."},{"question":"Run through this text and make a chronological bullet list starting from most recent of all the prizes that Murakami has won in the format of * {Prize} | {year}Personal prizesHaruki Murakami in 2018In 2006, Murakami became the sixth recipient of the Franz Kafka Prize.[65]In January 2009, Murakami received the Jerusalem Prize, a biennial literary award given to writers whose work deals with themes of human freedom, society, politics, and government. There were protests in Japan and elsewhere against his attending the February award ceremony in Israel, including threats to boycott his work as a response against Israel's recent bombing of the Gaza. Murakami chose to attend the ceremony, but gave a speech to the gathered Israeli dignitaries harshly criticizing Israeli policies.[66] Murakami said, \\"Each of us possesses a tangible living soul. The system has no such thing. We must not allow the system to exploit us.\\"[67]In 2011, Murakami donated his €80,000 winnings from the International Catalunya Prize (from the Generalitat de Catalunya) to the victims of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, and to those affected by the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Accepting the award, he said in his speech that the situation at the Fukushima plant was \\"the second major nuclear disaster that the Japanese people have experienced ... however, this time it was not a bomb being dropped upon us, but a mistake committed by our very own hands\\". According to Murakami, the Japanese people should have rejected nuclear power after having \\"learned through the sacrifice of the hibakusha just how badly radiation leaves scars on the world and human wellbeing\\".[68]In recent years, Haruki Murakami has often been mentioned as a possible recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.[15] Nonetheless, since all nomination records are sealed for 50 years from the awarding of the prize, it is pure speculation.[69] When asked about the possibility of being awarded the Nobel Prize, Murakami responded with a laugh saying \\"No, I don't want prizes. That means you're finished.\\"[15]In October 2014, he was awarded the Welt-Literaturpreis.[70]In April 2015, Murakami was named one of the TIME 100's most influential people. In November 2016, he was awarded the Danish Hans Christian Andersen Literature Award, an award previously won by British author JK Rowling.[71][72][73]In 2018 he was nominated for the New Academy Prize in Literature.[74] He requested that his nomination be withdrawn, saying he wanted to \\"concentrate on writing, away from media attention.\\"[75]","answer":"* Hans Christian Anderson Literature Award | 2016* Welt-Literaturpreis | 2014* International Catalunya Prize | 2011* Jerusalem Prize | 2009* Franz Kafka Prize | 2006"},{"question":"What, exactly, is rhetoric? Provide me some information that explains what rhetoric is, where the idea came from, and how it is applied. Do so in a way that a college student would understand using less than 250 words, and using no more than 3 sentences per paragraph.","answer":"Rhetoric was first mentioned by Aristotle in 350 B.C.E. Rhetoric is the act of persuading people in writing or orally to accept the writer’s or speaker’s argument as correct. Rhetoric uses three strategies to persuade: Logos, Ethos, and Pathos. In English, we know them as Logic, Ethics, and Emotion.Pathos/Emotion means to persuade by direct appeal to a person’s emotions so that they feel what the author wants them to feel. To accomplish this, the author chooses words, examples, and stories that evoke emotion. The ensuing emotional responses such as anger, frustration, or amusement can lead people to become sympathetic to the author’s position.Logos/Logic means to persuade by direct appeal to a person’s logical reasoning. To accomplish this, the author presents clear, logical connections between ideas, that are supported by facts and statistics or by presenting analogies. If the arguments presented contain unclear or erroneous assumptions in facts or analogic connections, known as logical fallacies, the argument can fail. Ethos/Ethics means to persuade by convincing a person of the author’s inherent credibility based on the author’s credentials and/or the credentials of the sources of facts and ideas presented as part of the argument. To accomplish this, the author presents their own and/or their sources’ academic, professional, and/or authorial history, details their personal experience as it relates to the issue, and demonstrates their complete understanding of the issue’s complexities by using counter arguments to an opposing position.

This one is set in a dystopian society where teenagers must survive -- much like Katniss and Peeta. * The Divergent Series: Here's another set of films set in a dystopian future with teenagers at the center of the plot. The society in these films is divided into factions whereas the society in The Hunger Games is divided into districts. * Mortal Engines: This film, like The Hunger Games, features a strong female lead.

Can we start our discussion with a short paragraph of 5 sentences?","answer":"The two main types of machine learning are supervised and unsupervised models. Supervised models have a target variable they are attempting to build a model around.

Mom makes me brush my teeth and put on my school uniform. Then I help her get my backpack ready. We get in the car and drive to school. We listen to music, which is fun. After Mom drops me off, I go to the cafeteria and get breakfast. I like French toast sticks and chocolate milk. After I eat, I go to my classroom and say good morning to my teacher. My teacher is nice, but sometimes I get into trouble for talking when I’m not supposed to. If I have a question, I’m supposed to raise my hand first and wait for the teacher to say my name. After I sit down at my desk, we listen to the morning announcements and then start learning stuff. Right now, we are working on writing and saying letters of the alphabet. After we do some letter stuff, the teacher will let us sit on the carpet and have story time. I like story time because my teacher reads us a different book every single day! And then, after story time, we go to specials! Sometimes we have P.E., and sometimes we have music. I like P.E. because we get to run around and play games. My favorite is kickball.After specials, it’s time for lunch. I love lunch because the cafeteria has hot meals, and I get to choose what I want to eat every day. I also get to sit and talk with my friends when we eat lunch. After lunch, it’s time for recess! If it’s sunny outside, we get to play on the playground. I like swinging on the swings or playing tag with my friends. If it’s raining, though, we have to stay inside and play with arts and crafts stuff. Sometimes that can be fun. Then we start learning again. We work on numbers after recess. Sometimes we count, sometimes we write, and sometimes we add small numbers together to make bigger numbers. When it’s almost time to leave school for the day, the afternoon announcements come on. After we listen to them, we get our backpacks ready and walk outside to the pick-up line.

Acting as a global conveyor belt, ocean currents transport heat from the equator toward the poles, helping to balance the Earth's temperature. This happens through a process called thermohaline circulation, driven by differences in temperature (thermo-) and salt content (-haline). Warmer, less dense water from the equator moves along the ocean surface towards the poles. As it reaches the colder regions, the water cools, becomes denser and saltier, and sinks into the deep ocean. This colder water then flows back towards the equator, where it warms up again and rises to the surface, completing the cycle. This process is critical for redistributing heat around the planet, and disruptions to it due to climate change could have profound impacts on global climate patterns."},{"question":"After reading this tweet, do you think that the person who wrote it is a CELEBRITY or AVERAGE PERSON?Tweet: Heading to talk some tea on #whenrealityhits this week is gonna be good a lotTo unpack.","answer":"The person who wrote the tweet is a celebrity because they reference talking on what seems like a public platform that will reach many people."},{"question":"How many bones are in the human hand?","answer":"The human hand is made up of the wrist, palm, and fingers and consists of 27 bones.

End it with a cliffhanger so I can make up the next part of the story.","answer":"Once upon a time, a long time ago, there was a little girl named Judith. She was just about your age and had just finished the third grade. She loved to go to her grandmother's house in the summer, and one of her favorite activities was to play in the big barn her great-grandfather built before she was born.The barn smelled like old hay and horses, even though there had been no horses there as long as Judith could remember. An old tractor was parked inside, and there were other things scattered around, like old leather harnesses, wooden buckets, and rusty chains. Judith would pretend each of the horse stalls was a room in her grown-up mansion.One day, Judith was feeling particularly adventurous. She decided she wanted to see what was inside a room in one corner of the barn. The door to the room was held closed by an old padlock. Judith saw the padlock was not snapped shut. It would be easy to remove it and open the door!Judith was curious and couldn't wait to see what was inside. She easily removed the lock and dropped it on the ground with a thud, then she slowly pulled the old door open. The hinges squeaked, and her heart was beating fast. She was excited and a little afraid, but she couldn't wait to see what was inside.The inside of the small room was dark, but some sunlight shone through the wooden slats of the barn wall, and she was able to make out the shapes of a shelf with old tools, some shovels and hoes propped up against the wall, and one big, cardboard box that was taped shut.The box caught Judith's eye at once. She wanted to know what hidden treasures might be stored inside! The tape was loose from years of summer heat, so the flaps of the box opened easily. There was only one thing inside. It looked like a black stick. She grabbed one end of the stick to pull it out of the box and gasped when she saw a cloud of little, white stars come out of the other end! What kind of stick was this? Could this be a magic wand?"},{"question":"Can you write a fictional Facebook post promoting a small home goods store in downtown Hartley having a 20% off sale this Saturday.","answer":"Shop small this Saturday!

Focus on the recommended size and materials.","answer":"The size and shape of chicken coops is usually determined by the number of chickens to be housed. A general rule of thumb is to allow at least four square feet of space per chicken. If your flock will have limited access to the outdoors, you should look at chicken coops that provide up to ten square feet of space per chicken. Built-in features like roosts and nesting boxes will make your chickens comfortable and encourage them to lay plenty of eggs. Adding a fenced run that is a great way to let your birds enjoy the outdoors while protecting them from predators.Building materials are another important consideration when shopping for a chicken coop. Avoid building materials that may rot, harbor pests or be toxic to chickens. At the same time, you want to choose a material that is sturdy and durable. Repurposed wood is perfectly acceptable if you're building your own coop, but you need to make sure that the lumber you use is treated to prevent wood rot and mold.

I have no experience with painting so please explain what the items I need will be used for.","answer":"Here is a list of items you will need to begin oil painting:1. Oil Paint - Oil paint comes in tubes that can be purchased individually or in a set. As you are new to oil painting, a set with basic colors is a good place to start. You will need tubes of white, black, red, blue and yellow.2. Brushes - As a beginner, you do not need many brushes, it is best to master a few basic sizes before branching out to more costly options. A variety of one or two small, medium, and large round brushes will be enough to begin with. 3. Turpentine or Mineral Spirits - Oil paint does not require water for brush cleaning. Instead, you use a paint-thinning solution to clean excess paint from the bristles. Turpentine is a commonly used phrase for this substance, but mixtures of odorless mineral spirits are a common alternative. Be sure to work in a well-ventilated area as these liquids can be harmful.4. A jar for cleaning brushes - You will need a glass vessel with a lid to store your turpentine or mineral spirits for cleaning. Ensure the vessel has a secure lid to seal in the vapor when not used.5. Linseed Oil or Oil Medium - Much like mineral spirits and turpentine, linseed oil will dilute oil paint. However, as it is oil-based, it creates an ideal consistency without sacrificing the paint’s texture when painting. You can use this in the same way you would use water to thin-down other paints, such as watercolors.6. Rags - Rags are used to wipe your brushes after cleaning once you have dipped them in your jar. 7. Palette - You will need a clean, hard, non-porous surface to decant and mix your paint on.8. Painting Surface - Any surface can be painted with oil as long as it is primed with Gesso. The most common surfaces are canvas, thick paper, or wooden panels."},{"question":"Give me about 150 words of information about the location of the hotel in “The Shining” and how it contributed to the film’s mood.","answer":"The Overland Hotel and its disorienting hedge maze add the perfect note of terror to Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film \\"The Shining.\\" Although the Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood in Oregon was used for a few exterior shots, most scenes were filmed on a set that represented the interior and exterior of the isolated hotel.

The first is that My Photo Stream, the free cloud-based photo syncing feature Apple launched in 2011, is still up and running in 2023. That’s despite it being effectively superseded by iCloud Photo Library roughly eight years ago. Now that you’re up to date, the second piece of news is that My Photo Stream is shutting down in a couple of months’ time on July 26th, according to an Apple Support page spotted by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.The end of My Photo Stream won’t come as too much of a surprise. Although it was free, it came with a long list of restrictions on the amount of photos you could upload, and these were only saved on Apple’s servers for 30 days. Photos saved in the cloud then had to be manually saved locally if you wanted to keep them on a secondary device and, perhaps worst of all, 9to5Mac notes that high-quality photos weren’t synced in their original resolution. iCloud’s free storage may be relatively limited at just 5GB, but at least it acts like a modern cloud storage service with photos and videos stored in their full resolution. Apple’s support page notes that new photo uploads to My Photo Stream will come to an end on June 26th, and that the feature will disappear entirely a month later. “The photos in My Photo Stream are already stored on at least one of your devices,” Apple’s page notes, “So as long as you have the device with your originals, you won’t lose any photos as part of this process.” ","answer":"Q: Is My Photo Stream, Apple's cloud-based photo syncing feature, still available in 2023?A: Yes, My Photo Stream is still available in 2023 despite being superseded by iCloud Photo Library.Q: When will My Photo Stream be shutting down?A: My Photo Stream is set to shut down on July 26th.Q: Is the end of My Photo Stream surprising?A: The end of My Photo Stream is not surprising because it had limitations such as restricted photo uploads, photos saved for only 30 days, and a lack of syncing high-quality photos in their original resolution.Q: How does iCloud differ from My Photo Stream?A: iCloud offers modern cloud storage with photos and videos stored in their full resolution, unlike My Photo Stream.Q: When will new photo uploads to My Photo Stream come to an end?A: New photo uploads to My Photo Stream will come to an end on June 26th.Q: Will users lose any photos when My Photo Stream shuts down?A: “The photos in My Photo Stream are already stored on at least one of your devices,” Apple’s page notes, “So as long as you have the device with your originals, you won’t lose any photos as part of this process.” "},{"question":"How many full terms did President Lyndon Baines Johnson serve as president?

Here are some ways you can bond with your cat that don't involve them being too active.1. Treats: Treats are a great way to bond with your feline companion. You can use handheld Churo treats if you want your cat to come close to you, as many cats love licking those treats.2. Toy Mice: Although some toys involve cats running around a lot, toy mice tend to be better as your cat can play with them in one spot if they choose to. Sit on the floor with your cat and toss them some toy mice, encouraging them to play. You can also get toy mice that have squeakers or catnip, both of which will further encourage your cat to get involved.3. Petting: Petting is a great, underrated way to bond with your cat. Make sure you take note of where your cat likes to be petted. Most cats don't like being touched on their belly, but some love head scratches! You can test this out by gently petting them in different places and looking for signs that they do or don't enjoy what's going on. If they don't enjoy it, try switching to petting them in a different place.4. Catnip: Providing catnip is a good way to bring your cat close to you. Try putting some in objects that are near you, as they'll attract your cat to come closer.5. Give Them Space: Believe it or not, giving your cat space can be a great way to bond with a skittish cat. Some cats would prefer to come to you rather than you coming to them, especially if they're new to your household. Chill near them, but don't force them to interact, and you might notice it's not long before your cat is sliding closer and warming up to you.Remember that all cats are different, so it's important to observe your cat's personality and learn their likes and dislikes. By doing this, you'll quickly find the best way to bond with them."},{"question":"Write a short biography about Jeffrey Dahmer.

","answer":"Jeffrey Dahmer was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on May 21, 1960, to Lionel and Joyce Dahmer.  He is a convicted serial killer, having murdered 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991. He grew up in Bath, Ohio and developed a fascination with dead animals after his father removed one that had died under their house. He collected road kill and dead animals, and his father taught him how to preserve their bones. In high school, Dahmer developed a drinking problem and was a bit of an outcast. His parents separated shortly after he graduated and he ended up living alone in the family home. During this time he picked up a hitchhiker, Steven Hicks, and took him to the house to drink beer. After several hours, Hicks wanted to leave and Dahmer wanted him to stay and killed him. Dahmer attended college for a short time and joined the Army. He eventually found his way back to Wisconsin.

I have a good chili recipe, but I really want to add something to my chili that will surprise people. Can you help me brainstorm  three unusual ingredients I can put in my chili that will make people say, \\"What is that?\\"","answer":"Not a problem. Let me help you brainstorm some ideas for unusual ingredients for your chili recipe. 1. Fish Sauce. Fish sauce may sound like a weird ingredient for a chili recipe, but it will bring your chili's umami flavor up another level. Umami is synonymous with savouriness, and your chili should be a hearty, savory dish. The Fish sauce will be a great unusual ingredient to add.  2. Balsamic Vinegar: Balsamic Vinegar will help add salt content to your chili. It also adds a sour, tangy note. These two additional flavor profiles will help give your chili that wow factor. 3. Whiskey. Whiskey has been known to add depth to many savory dishes. By adding whiskey to your chili, you will be enhancing all the other flavors in the recipe. Be sure to give your chili time to cook the alcohol out. "},{"question":"Hello. Can you write a fictional interview between two people? The interviewer is a dainty, knowledgeable lady.

Here is the article I am referring to:After Germany's defeat in the Second World War, the four main allies in Europe - the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and France - took part in a joint occupation of the German state. With the original understanding that the country would eventually be reunified, the Allied Powers agreed to share the responsibility of administering Germany and its capital, Berlin, and each took responsibility for a certain portion of the defeated nation. This arrangement ultimately evolved into the division of Germany into a Western and an Eastern sector, thereby contributing to the Cold War division of Europe.During the Second World War, one of the major topics under discussion at conferences of the Allied leadership was how to deal with Germany after the war. Having experienced great losses as a result of German invasions in the First and Second World Wars, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin preferred that a defeated Germany be dismembered and divided so that it could not rise to its former strength to threaten European peace and security again. At the Tehran Conference between U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in 1943, the two countries agreed that after the war Germany would be divided and occupied jointly. At the final wartime conference between these two men at Yalta in 1945, the two powers agreed to shift the eastern border of Germany to the West, enlarging western Poland as compensation for the eastern sections of that country annexed by the Soviet Union. They also determined that the occupation would divide Germany into sections, with each Allied power taking responsibility for one section, although they would be governed as a single economic unit in anticipation of their eventual reunification. Finally, they also concluded that they would demand reparations from Germany, although they did not yet agree on exactly how much they would request. A meeting later in 1945 between Stalin and new U.S. President Harry Truman held at Potsdam confirmed and ratified these arrangements.After the victory over the Axis powers, however, the wartime cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union soon faded. In reality, mutual distrust ruled the relationship between the two countries, and nowhere was this more evident than in the difficulties over the occupation of Germany. The Allies agreed to a joint occupation, with each country taking charge of a larger zone and a sector of the nation's capital, Berlin. Upon British insistence, France joined Great Britain and the United States in the occupation of West Germany and West Berlin, while the Soviet Union managed the affairs of East Germany and East Berlin.","answer":"1.

That is because gravity on the moon is a sixth of what it is on Earth. The moon's gravity is so much lower because the noon is just 1% the mass of Earth.

When he connected wires to his battery and a piece of carbon, the carbon glowed, producing light. His invention was known as the Electric Arc lamp. And while it produced light, it didn’t produce it for long and was much too bright for practical use.Over the next seven decades, other inventors also created “light bulbs” but no designs emerged for commercial application. More notably, in 1840, British scientist Warren de la Rue enclosed a coiled platinum filament in a vacuum tube and passed an electric current through it. The design was based on the concept that the high melting point of platinum would allow it to operate at high temperatures and that the evacuated chamber would contain fewer gas molecules to react with the platinum, improving its longevity. Although an efficient design, the cost of the platinum made it impractical for commercial production.In 1850 an English physicist named Joseph Wilson Swan created a “light bulb” by enclosing carbonized paper filaments in an evacuated glass bulb. And by 1860 he had a working prototype, but the lack of a good vacuum and an adequate supply of electricity resulted in a bulb whose lifetime was much too short to be considered an effective producer of light. However, in the 1870’s better vacuum pumps became available and Swan continued experiments on light bulbs. In 1878, Swan developed a longer lasting light bulb using a treated cotton thread that also removed the problem of early bulb blackeningSummarize the text as it relates to the design of the light bulb.","answer":"The first electric light was invented in 1802 by Humphry Davy.

Seattle clinched a Stanley Cup Playoff berth this season and advanced to Game 7 of the Western Conference Second Round, a 2-1 loss at the Dallas Stars. The Kraken went 46-28-8 to clinch the first wild card into the postseason from the West and eliminated the defending Stanley Cup champion Colorado Avalanche in seven games in the first round.Seattle finished 27-49-6, the third-worst record in the League, in its first NHL season.\\"Every year is different; every year is unique. There's always challenges,\\" Francis told NHL.com on April 11. \\"But I think for us, it's certainly been more gratifying than the first year.\\"Francis was Carolina Hurricanes GM from 2014-18 and worked in their front office for 12 seasons before the Kraken hired him July 18, 2019. Seattle stood pat before the 2023 NHL Trade Deadline on March 3 but set NHL records in wins and points (100) for a second-year team and for the greatest improvement from a team's first to second season (19 wins, 40 points). Seattle moved 18 spots in the standings, second-most this season behind the New Jersey Devils (plus-25). Forward Jared McCann (40 goals) and center Matty Beniers (24) were the only two Kraken players to top 23 goals for a team that averaged 3.52 goals per game, which tied the Devils for fourth in the NHL. Beniers is a finalist for the Calder Trophy, voted as NHL rookie of the year, along with Buffalo Sabres defenseman Owen Power and Edmonton Oilers goalie Stuart Skinner.\\"I think every GM, his goal starting is to get into the playoffs,\\" Francis said. \\"Certainly, it's no different for me and my team. The biggest thing for us to be able to show improvement from where we were last year as a new franchise in a new market, trying to show our fan base that, hey, we're getting better, we're moving in the right direction was what we were trying to accomplish. I might be lying a little bit if I said I saw it going this well, but it has and that's a kudos to our players and our coaching staff and the effort that they've put in to get to this point.\\"Francis, a center who played 22 NHL seasons, was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2007.

Write no more than 500 words. ","answer":"Most men have heard of the legendary Nubis Wisefoot, who descended from the clouds after heavy rainfall. Just a quarter day's travel south of the Ketturra Village, in a clearing in Ketturra Forest, a young carpenter found the child within the petals of a large lotus flower right in the center of a small pond. The man and his wife had been praying for a child for no less than five years. Seeing this as an answer to their prayers, the young man freed the child from the lotus flower only to find he had a jackal's head; however, the man was not put off by the child's strange appearance and brought him home. The wife of the young man also found great solace in finally having a child and felt no concern over the child's difference. They named the child Nubis, as they reasoned he had descended from the clouds, as a gift from the gods.As Nubis grew into a man, the carpenter, and his wife noted that not only could Nubis speak and reason better than most other people in Ketturra Village, but he was adept at swordplay and fighting. Often, Nubis spoke of joining the royal guard of the Kingdom of Akhetua and training tirelessly with the local smith to hone his skills in swordplay. One day, Nubis packed his horse, Cabbage, and made his way to the capitol to submit himself to the trials meant to test would-be knights.The first trial, meant to test one’s strength, took place in the Colosseum, in which the contestant fought off several terrible monsters. Nubis completed the trial with ease, much to the surprise and delight of the royal court.The second trial, meant to test one’s mind, consisted of several puzzles, all of which Nubis again solved with ease.The third and final trial, meant to test one’s loyalty, required the contestant to obey the order of the king. Nubis was ordered to kill a man believed to be innocent without question. Unable to follow through with such a task, Nubis abandoned his quest to become a knight and chose to roam the world instead.

Include some relevant information about how olive oil has been used by the church in religious ceremonies. Keep the word count under 300 words.","answer":"Olive Oil FactsOlive Oil has been a staple of the Mediterranean diet for centuries. It’s the only vegetable oil that can be consumed just the way it is, freshly pressed from the olive. It contains many beneficial health effects. Consuming just two teaspoons each day can prevent heart disease and gallstones. Research has also shown that it can lower your risk of colon cancer. Olive Oil is a good cure-all for many afflictions. But it has also been used for many centuries in religious ceremonies. In the Roman Catholic church, for instance, olive oil has been utilized by Priests to perform a variety of ceremonies, such as baptisms, Confirmations, and even as fuel for lamps in their churches. During ancient times, olive oil was used to anoint a king during his coronation ceremony. In 1 Samuel 10, the mighty prophet of old Samuel uses a flask of olive oil to anoint Saul, the very first king of Israel.Almost since time began, olives have been associated with peace. An olive tree cannot be grown in a hostile environment. It requires lush, fertile soil and arid temperatures. Even then, it will take several years before the olive tree can produce fruit. But once it does, this amazing tree can live for up to 500 years. Olive trees have an almost titanic resistance, a vital force that renders them nearly immortal. Despite harsh winters and burning summers, despite truncations, they continue to grow, proud and strong, reaching towards the sky, bearing fruit that nourishes and heals, inspires, and amazes."},{"question":"Rewrite the famous Col Jessup speech about handling the truth from the POV of a redneck.

If they decided it's a good bill, they approve it and send it to the House, where the Representatives will talk about it and decide whether they like it or not. The House isn't like a house you live in. It's a big building where the Representatives work.6. The Representatives vote to pass the bill or not pass it.7. If enough of them vote for the bill, it is passed to the Senate and they discuss it and vote on it too.8. If they vote to pass the bill, it's sent to the President who decides to sign and pass it, turning it into a law.9. Finally, the new law is enforced by the police and the courts.

Make it realistic, with a moral dilemma.","answer":"Once upon a time, two kittens lived together in a house with a human roommate. One kitten was little, energetic, and naughty. His name was Sootsprite, and his fur was black. He liked to test boundaries, and he didn't mind if he got punished from time to time. In Sootsprite's mind, the world was meant to be explored.The other kitten was a bit of a princess. She was fluffy and preferred to sit on a cozy windowsill and watch the world go by. Her fur was gray, and her name was Malarkey. She didn't like to get in trouble because she knew if she was bad, she would get sprayed with a squirt bottle.One sunny day, Sootsprite's and Malarkey's human roommate left to go somewhere. They heard talking in excited voices. The man took his car keys and held the door open for a woman. \\"You be good now,\\" he said, looking right at Sootsprite. \\"I'm counting on you to not make a mess.\\"Malarkey looked back and forth between the man and Sootsprite. \\"Oh no,\\" she thought. \\"This could be bad.\\"Sure enough, as soon as he heard the keys turn in the lock, the little black cat jumped up from the couch. He ran to the window, pushing Malarkey aside and watched as a white car pulled away from the curb. He turned to Malarkey with a big toothy grin on his face. She stared back and shook her head.But Sootsprite didn't heed her warning. He jumped down from the windowsill and ran into the kitchen.CRASH!Malarkey sighed and decided to go and see what he'd done. She stretched her back legs, then her front legs, and gracefully hopped to the couch, then the ground.By the time she got to the kitchen, there were treats all over the linoleum. Sootsprite was on the top of the refrigerator -- a VERY naughty place to be. He peeked over the edge with his grin.Malarkey could smell the treats, and she felt tempted by their fishy shape. Should she eat them? She wasn't sure."},{"question":"help me write a happy birthday text message to my mother-in-law, tell her how I cherish her, how I feel grateful to have her and wish her long life and success in all she does.","answer":"On this special day, I want to wish you a happy birthday filled with love, laughter, and joy, Mother-in-law.

We drive to the left in my current location. Throw in warnings about Perry the Platypus and jealous references to your brother Roger.","answer":"Hello there, so you want to learn to parallel park? Good idea, because only then can you fully take over the Tri-State Area. Of course, my perfect brother Roger already knows how to parallel park. Here are the steps to parallel parking:1. First ensure that Perry the Platypus is nowhere nearby because he's sure to foil your perfect parking plans.2. Drive as close to the car in front of the parking spot you wish to take as possible. Brake gently, and use your left turn signal to indicate that you want to park. Pull your car about 2 feet next to the car in front of your desired parking spot, stopping when your rear bumper is aligned with its rear bumper.3. Looking out for any suspicious beaver tails and fedoras, shift into reverse and start turning your wheel to the left as you back up.  Once the back of your seat is even with the rear bumper of the vehicle beside you, turn your steering wheel quickly and evenly towards the spot until your vehicle is at a 45-degree angle as it enters the spot. Be sure to look over your shoulder as you back up to make sure there's nothing in your blind spot. Perfect Roger, of course, can skip this step because he has no blind spots.4. Once your rear tire is about 18 inches from the curb and your front bumper is next to the rear bumper of the vehicle in front, start turning your steering wheel to the right to straighten the car up while still reversing. 5. Once you're fully in the space, you'll likely have to center your vehicle in the space between the spots in front of you and behind you by moving your car slowly and carefully backward or forwards. Be careful not to scrape the other cars. Also, watch out for Perry the Platypus.Congratulations, by following these steps you have successfully parallel parked! You are now one step closer to conquering the Tri-State Area!"},{"question":"Write a poem about making road trip memories.","answer":"Windows downYellow and white linesRoadside Attractions blurring by The lights of every cityA new memory to store Laughing to our sing-alongsLicense plate games We all swear we wonRoad trip fun  "},{"question":"Compose a funny tweet by a concerned cat about their owners buying less cat nip.

","answer":"Alistair entered the communal kitchen and dining area. He found Samantha hunched over her datapad, her brow furrowed in deep concentration. He grabbed a bowl of hot soup from the pot on the cooking plate and joined her, curious about her progress in solving the power supply issue that plagued them.Samantha looked up, her eyes tired but determined. “Alistair, I’ve been analyzing the power fluctuations, and I think I’m closer to locating the source. I just need to check a few more things. I don’t need to mention what losing our heat would do.”“No, you don’t.” Alistair’s heart sank at the thought. The bitter cold of Mesiea’s Bite was unforgiving, and the habitat would lose heat at a rapid rate without a reliable power source. It would take only a few hours for the temperature inside to reach life-threatening levels.He leaned over to look at the data displayed on Samantha’s screen, a labyrinth of fluctuating graphs and perplexing numbers. “Engineering is not one of my strengths, but that looks bad.” He said.Samantha nodded, her expression a mix of determination and concern. “It’s quite unstable.

I got two young bulls before the herd dispersed.”Samantha’s eyes brightened with a glimmer of hope. “Well, at least we eat!” Samantha grinned. “I’ll scrape up a team if it kills me and see if I can keep this place warm enough for us to enjoy dinner.”“Count me in. I can wield a wrench if someone points me at the correct nut and bolt.” Alistair grinned.Samantha laughed. “Done. You have time to finish your snack.

Marsha P. Johnson, a self-identified drag queen and prominent gay liberation activist, was one of the most well-known participants in the event.  In 1999, The Stonewall Inn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was the first LGBTQIA+ location to appear on the register. In 2000, it was named a National Historic Landmark.

The blinding glow of infernal lights illuminated the cursed domain, casting sinister shadows that danced along the walls. Demonic guards, with their razor-sharp horns and sulfurous breath, slammed their truncheons against the metal bunks, jolting the imprisoned souls from their fitful slumber. The air echoed with their spine-chilling screams as they bellowed orders.Amidst the clamor, the souls rose from their charred resting places, their eyes filled with a haunting despair. With trepidation, they lined up in their cubicles, their gazes fixed straight ahead, awaiting the morning count. The guards, grotesque demons with smoldering eyes, conducted the ritualistic inspection, ensuring the presence of every damned soul. Time seemed to crawl as the wretched captives shuffled through the dimly lit corridors, hurrying to the fetid latrines. In the absence of mirrors, they spared themselves the torment of seeing their wretched visages, their heads shaven clean, a stark symbol of their damned existence.Clad in threadbare garments, the souls marched outside, braving the oppressive heat that enveloped the infernal realm. They converged with other platoons on the scorched parade grounds, a desolate expanse where their infernal punishments took shape. The platoon captain, a towering demon with bat-like wings, addressed the tormented gathering, his voice dripping with malice.\\"Welcome to the training grounds of eternal suffering,\\" the platoon captain snarled, his voice resonating through the sulfurous air. \\"Here, you will endure physical torment that matches the depths of your sins. You will run, you will sweat, and you will learn the true meaning of despair.\\"As the platoon captain continued his diabolic sermon, the souls stood motionless, their minds clouded with a mix of fear and resignation. The captain recited a haunting mantra, a twisted creed of survival within the infernal abyss.\\"In the fiery depths of Hell, there is no rest for the weak,\\" the captain proclaimed, his voice echoing with sadistic delight. \\"Every soul must strive to outpace their fellow tormentor or risk descending further into the abyss. Whether you be demon or damned, heed my words—when the flames rise, you must run.\\"And so, they ran. The main character, their spirit weary and broken, dragged themselves along, their every step burdened with the weight of their sins. The demonic guards, their monstrous forms towering over the tortured souls, barked commands and lashed out with fiery whips, their taunts and jeers fueling the captives' desperate resolve. The main character, their head throbbing with infernal pain, pushed forward, an embodiment of defiance amid the relentless torment.The midday respite brought no reprieve from their anguish. Instead, they were subjected to another vile meal—nauseating concoctions served on tarnished platters. The platoon captain, a demon of sadistic delight, introduced the \\"Stripes of Shame\\" with malevolent glee. The striped garments, adorned with hellish symbols of punishment, served as a constant reminder of their fallen status. The platoon captain's words dripped with venom as they explained the purpose of these garments—to humiliate, degrade, and remind the condemned souls of their eternal damnation.Chained and silenced, the souls were led like a procession of broken spirits, their striped smocks billowing in the sulfurous wind. They were herded into the accursed wagons, their limbs shackled to one another, their every movement restricted. It was during this treacherous journey, bound by the chains of their collective misery, that the main character encountered Julie Martin, a soul ensnared by her association with a wretched lover. They found solace in their shared predicament, a glimmer of camaraderie amidst the labyrinth of damned souls.

Obviously, it's important to consider your knowledge, skills, and experience, but price yourself with what you are comfortable earning so that you will continue to be motivated to keep up your freelance writing business for the long term. Here are some simplified steps to help you set your freelance writing rates. 1. Start with some online research. It's good to get a grasp on what people are paying in your industry or niche. If you don't have one, that's fine too! Seeing the differences in pay may be a factor to consider if you're thinking of choosing a niche. You can go to any of the freelance job platforms you're now a part of to see what clients are listing their budget as (even though it's not always listed), what other writers' rates are, and their level of experience/background. 2. Consider your professional and educational background. Even if you are new to freelance writing, any relevant experience can set you apart from others and provide a reason to charge a higher rate. This has its limits obviously, you must have the skill to back it up. If you have a degree in English or journalism, that sets you apart. Obviously, if you don't have a writing background or other credentials, this doesn't mean that you can't be a freelance writer, it just means that you may have to start at a lower rate until you have successfully completed a few projects and have some good reviews under your belt. 3. Consider the budget of potential clients. It's important to know what clients you are targeting. If you want to take on a client with a startup business, they will likely offer lower pay because that may be all that's in the budget. If you target more established businesses or individuals to write for, there may be more room for negotiation on your rate or the project cost.

What is its place in modern TV history?","answer":"The Simpsons is the longest-running animated show of all time. It first aired on December 17th, 1989 on FOX and is still currently airing new episodes in 2023. Homer and Bart are two of the most iconic characters in the recent history of television. It has inspired many other shows in various ways, such as South Park, Family Guy, Beavis and Butthead, and many more.The Simpsons is a modern interpretation of an everyday American family. Bart, the son, is a prototypical troublemaker with a knack for being much more intelligent than he makes people believe. Lisa, the daughter, is far above average intelligence and gets frustrated by the lack of others' intellect in the family. Homer, the father, is a working-class male who loves beer and works at the local power plant for minimal wages. Marge, the mother, is a housewife who loves her husband unconditionally and cares very much for her children's wellbeing. Maggie is the baby of the family and is almost always seen with a onesie on and a binkie in her mouth.While The Simpsons is most well-known for its longevity and iconic characters, the earlier seasons are peppered with insights into adolescent struggles and triumphs as well as the struggles that parents go through while navigating raising children and trying to maintain a healthy relationship like Homer and Marge do. Homer and Marge truly love each other, but the show isn't afraid to reveal that their marriage isn't always perfect and is often hard work. Self-deprecation from Homer is a part of most episodes, and the relationship between Bart and Homer is closer to that of a friendship than father and son.Part of the charm of The Simpsons is how unique and realistic the plots tend to be.  Many shows today still aren't willing to explore what The Simpsons were doing in the early 90s. The Simpsons have also correctly predicted many things that happened after the episodes aired, such as Donald Trump becoming president, the invention of smartwatches, and FaceTime. These are just a few examples."},{"question":"What caused the gaming market to nearly completely crash in 1983?","answer":"The gaming market crash of 1983 was caused by several factors--or, as I like to call them, unfixed bugs. There was no quality control, so no one was properly testing the games that companies were releasing. That's already lots of game-overs right out of the gate! The market was also extremely saturated; too many low-quality games being sold at once meant that people weren't willing to press the continue button anymore and stopped buying games. This led to a huge lack of trust between gamers and developers. Video games and consoles were also really expensive.

Please read over the information about the different layers of the sun provided below and condense it into a few sentences. The core is the hottest part of the sun. It averages around 27,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit. This is the powerhouse of the yellow star; it’s where the nuclear reactions that create the sun’s light and heat take place. The sun produces energy within its core, where extreme gravity creates incredible pressure. This pressure causes the hydrogen atoms in the core to collide with one another with so much force that they actually create a new element—helium. The answer to the question: how does the sun produce energy?, lies in this process. It’s called nuclear fusion, and it creates all the heat and light that every living thing on Earth relies on. From the core, all that heat radiates outward, traveling through the sun’s layers and atmospheric zones.As you move outward from the sun’s core, each layer of the sun itself is progressively cooler than the last. The radiative zone surrounds the core. Its temperature ranges from 7-12 million degrees Fahrenheit close to the core. The outside edges of this zone are closer to 2-4 million degrees. Thermal radiation from the core heats the radiative zone. This thermal radiation occurs as a result of the photons emitted from the helium and hydrogen atoms in the core. The next zone is the convection zone. This zone sits at a cool 4 million degrees Fahrenheit. It’s filled with bubbling plasma that transfers the heat of the radiative zone outwards, like water boiling in a pot. The edge of the convection zone is what can loosely be called the surface of the sun. However, this “surface” of liquid plasma is so hot that liquids and solids can’t actually exist there.","answer":"Three layers make up the sun: the core, the radiative zone and the convection zone. The core lies in the middle of the sun and, with an average temperate of 27,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit, is the hottest layer. The intense pressure, caused by gravity, creates nuclear fusion by forcing hydrogen atoms to collide and create helium. The second layer, the radiative zone, is cooler than the core with an average temperature ranging from 7 million to 12 million degrees Fahrenheit. Radiation from the core transfers to the radiative zone, transferring heat.The outermost layer is the convection zone at about four million degrees Fahrenheit, which is filled with bubbling plasma, and emits the heat of the radiative zone outwards."},{"question":"Summarize this for a fourth-grade classroom.

Garfield reluctantly shares his home with his human, Jon Arbuckle, and a sweet but gullible dog named Odie. Garfield's three biggest hobbies are taking frequent naps, eating massive amounts of lasagna and sharing adventures with Odie. Spoiled, clever and more than a little cunning, Lucifer from Disney's Cinderella is our second favorite cartoon cat. His mommy, Lady Tremaine, makes no secret that Lucifer is her favorite and treats the big cat like a king. However, Lucifer isn't above tormenting Lady Tremaine's daughters or her step-daughter, Cinderella, and occasionally Lady Tremaine herself. The fluffy black cat's face, often set in a sneer, turns into a sinister grin when he's being very naughty!Last but by no means least on our list is three-time Academy Award winner Sylvester J. Pussycat, Sr. Starring in more than 100 Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons, this black and white Tuxedo cat spends his days sleeping and chasing other animals. Some of his favorite adversaries are Tweety Bird and Speedy Gonzales. Although he never catches Tweety or Speedy, he never gives up and is always setting traps to try and snare them."},{"question":"Rewrite these sentences, but do not include any numbers.

During photosynthesis in green plants, light energy is captured and used to convert water, carbon dioxide and minerals into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds. It is impossible to overstate the role that photosynthesis plays in sustaining life on Earth. There would soon be little food or other organic matter on Earth if photosynthes stopped. The majority of organisms would vanish, and eventually, the atmosphere of the Earth would contain almost no gaseous oxygen. Only chemosynthetic bacteria, which can use the chemical energy of specific inorganic compounds and are not reliant on the conversion of light energy, would be able to survive in such an environment."},{"question":"Write a best man speech with a lighthearted but sentimental feeling.","answer":"Good evening everyone,As you all know, I am [best man’s name].

Although the plant, equipped with six nuclear reactors, terminated fission reactions automatically once it detected the earthquake, the resulting tsunami that arrived less an hour later breached the plant’s seawall and damaged the back-up generators needed to pump coolant to dissipate decay heat.

I live in Idaho and want plants that grow well in this climate. I also want plants that are resilient to weather changes and take minimum effort to grow.","answer":"Thank you for your question! I have found some garden plants that match your request.1. Lettuce: Lettuce does well in Idaho because it can withstand frost fairly well. It is also low maintenance, requiring little watering and can grow in any type of soil. It doesn't require a lot of space, so it is great for any garden size.2. Peas: You don't have to worry about the interaction of peas and other plants. They grow well among all plants and don't hinder the health of other plants. They thrive in cooler temperatures, meaning you can plant them early in Idaho and harvest them into late fall. They don't need much space and are a relatively hardy plant.3. Tomatoes: Tomatoes produce well in Idaho's summer climate, making them low maintenance. They can also do well even if planted in low-quality soil. They will need a stake or vegetable cage for support and to keep the wind from damaging them.4. Green Beans: Beans do well in Idaho summers because they are drought resistant, needing little water and doing well in direct sunlight. They also enrich the soil. Grow them once you're sure the risk of spring frost is gone. They do well growing up poles, meaning they don't need a lot of room.All gardens require some amount of work, but these plants should be relatively easy to cultivate in Idaho.
