Title: A Step Down from the Original Review: I have to say I'm fairly disappointed with this revamped version of the show. I can see why the changes were made, which I believe were to flesh out more of the story and make things a little clearer than the original. The only other improvement I can think of off the top of my head is the lyrics, which are sharper and less cheesy than the 1996 counterpart. Unfortunately, by improving the story, they've sacrificed the music and overall emotional quality of the show, and knowing these writers from their previous work, I guess I've been spoiled expecting high quality music and storytelling. Unless you're a diehard theater and Boublil/Schonberg fan, I'd definitely go with the 1996 version. The tunes are nicer, better sung, and the orchestrations are astronomically better! I'm a little hesitant now to see the show. Answer:OPTIONS:- No- YesA:","answer":"No"},{"question":"Consider the question. John has to pay taxes. He earned 100,000 for the year.

If the answer is '12000'; explain the reasoning:","answer":"His taxable income is 100,000 - 30,000 = 70,000. So he pays 20,000 * .1 = 2000 tax at the lower rate. He has to pay 70,000 - 20,000 = 50,000 at the higher rate. The taxes for that is 50,000 * .2 = 10,000.

Please consider the following points while generating an output. 1) The claim will always have supporting proof in the paragraph, and the paragraph will have a clear point of view supporting the claim. 2) There can be instances where direct correlation to the claim is not available. Make use of the sentences in the paragraph to provide a corresponding output supporting the claim. 3) The explanation should be at least one and at most twelve sentences long.Example: Paragraph: \\"Although the story didn’t cite the cost of appendectomy – emergency or urgent surgery – and we wish it had, we nonetheless will give it a satisfactory score because it at least cited what the editorial writer wrote, \\"\\"A secondary benefit is the savings to the hospital generated by minimizing staff and anesthesiologist presence late in the evening and during the wee hours of the morning.\\"\\" As with our harms score above, although the story didn’t give absolute numbers, in this case we think it was sufficient for it to report that \\"\\"The scientists found no significant difference among the groups in the patients’ condition 30 days after surgery or in the length of their operation or hospital stay.\\"\\" Although the story didn’t give absolute numbers, in this case we think it was sufficient for it to report that \\"\\"The scientists found no significant difference among the groups in the patients’ condition 30 days after surgery or in the length of their operation or hospital stay.\\"\\" Despite running less than 300 words, this story did an adequate job in explaining the quality of the evidence, including pointing out limitations. No disease-mongering here. The story meets the bare minimum requirement for this criterion in that it at least cited what an editorial stated. The focus of the story was on a study comparing emergency appendectomy with surgery done up to 12 hours later or beyond. This is the whole focus of the story – and one we applaud – when it begins:  \\"\\"Appendectomy is the most common emergency surgery in the world, but it doesn’t have to be.\\"\\" There were no claims made about the novelty of this research, and we may have wished for a bit more context on this. Nonetheless, the potential for guiding future care decisions was made clear. Not applicable. Given that the story only pulled excerpts from the journal article and the accompanying editorial, and didn’t include any fresh quotes from interviews, we can’t be sure of the extent to which it may have been influenced by a news release.\\". Claim: Some appendicitis cases may not require ’emergency’ surgeryExample solution: We really don’t understand why only a handful of mainstream news organizations reported this story. (At least in what we found.) The most common emergency surgery in the world. Rushing to emergency surgery may not carry any benefit. Waiting a few hours may be safer and less expensive. Why is that not a story? We applaud USA Today for finding time and space – and clearly it didn’t need to free up much space to do a good job telling the story. The story explains that as many as 300,0 appendectomies are done each year in the US. That figure alone explains why this is an important study to report.Example explanation: The output is an analysis of the claim while considering the paragraph as a reference. The output highlights the key features presented in the paragraph and explains the claim accordingly.Problem: Paragraph: The Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics said Thursday that the number of U.S. babies born last year fell 2 percent from 2016 to 3.85 million, also a 30-year low. Births have fallen for three straight years. The fertility rate dropped 3 percent last year to 60.2 births per 1,000 women ages 15 through 44. An aging society has already weighed on economic growth in the United States in the past decade, with the vast baby boom generation retiring and fewer young people replacing them. Thursday’s data suggests that the trend is likely to continue. Economic growth is generally driven by population growth and worker efficiency, both of which have slowed in the past decade in the United States. Kathy Bostjancic, an economist at Oxford Economics, a consulting firm, said that roughly 10 years ago, the number of Americans working or looking for work was growing about 1 percent annually. With birthrates declining, that figure has since fallen to about a 0.3 percent growth rate. That essentially acts as a 0.7 percentage point drag on the United States’ long-run growth. “Demographics have a really powerful impact on the economy,” Bostjancic said. The U.S. economy has grown at a 3 percent average annual rate since World War II. Yet it hasn’t reached that pace for a full calendar year since 2005. The baby boomers first reached retirement age in 2008. The Federal Reserve in March upgraded its short-term economic growth forecast to about 2.7 percent for this year and 2.4 percent in 2019, partly because of the Trump administration’s tax cuts. But the Fed kept its longer-run annual growth forecast at just 1.8 percent, reflecting the demographic headwinds. Aside from fewer workers, an aging society can hold back growth because fewer people are buying homes, cars and other costly purchases. Savings generally rise as people age and prepare for retirement. And as elderly people live longer, they also slow their spending while in retirement, Bostjancic noted. Most economists attribute the low interest rates and low inflation of the past decade, in the United States, Europe and Japan, at least in part to aging. In Japan, where adult diapers outsell those for children, the impact of fewer births has kept growth nearly nonexistent for more than two decades. The economy has picked up recently and enjoyed two straight years of growth, the longest such streak since the late 1980s, before contracting again in the first three months of this year. The U.S. accepts many more immigrants than does Japan, and that influx has boosted population growth. The Labor Department released separate data Thursday showing that last year, there were 27.4 million foreign-born workers in the United States, the most since records began in 2005. Immigrants now make up 17.1 percent of the U.S. workforce. Economic research earlier this year found that U.S. fertility fell sharply roughly nine months before the past three recessions. That suggests that such declines could signal economic downturns. But Kasey Buckles, an economics professor at Notre Dame who conducted the research with two colleagues, said that recent such declines aren’t sharp enough to point to a recession. Instead, she noted that fertility declines over the past three years have occurred mostly among women under 30. Birth rates among older women have risen or held steady. That suggests that the fertility declines largely reflect a drop in unwanted pregnancies since the 2008-2009 recession. Fertility among women of all ages fell sharply in 2008 and 2009, Buckles said, but rebounded quickly for women 30 and over. Separate data from the Guttmacher Institute, a policy organization that tracks reproductive health, shows that unwanted pregnancies have fallen since the Great Recession, Buckles said. “It’s possible that the Great Recession may have been something of a triggering event that caused people to be more intentional about their fertility,” she said. ___ Contact Chris Rugaber on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/ChrisRugaber .

They were right. This is a confused movie that can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a romantic fantasy, or a drama about female mid-life crisis. It fails at all three.Alice (Mia Farrow) is a restless middle aged woman who has married into great wealth and leads a life of aimless luxury with her rather boring husband and their two small children. This rather mundane plot concept is livened up with such implausibilities as an old Chinese folk healer who makes her invisible with some magic herbs, and the ghost of a former lover (with whom she flies over Manhattan). If these additions sound too fantastic for you, how about something more prosaic, like an affair with a saxophone player?I was never quite sure of what this mixed up muddle was trying to say. There are only a handful of truly funny moments in the film, and the endingis a really preposterous touch of Pollyanna.Rent 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' instead, a superbly well-done film that suceeds in combining comedy with a serious consideration of ethics and morals.

The shift to neoclassical architecture is conventionally dated to the 1750s. It first gained influence in England and France; in England, Sir William Hamilton's excavations at Pompeii and other sites, the influence of the Grand Tour and the work of William Chambers and Robert Adam, was pivotal in this regard. In France, the movement was propelled by a generation of French art students trained in Rome, and was influenced by the writings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann. The style was also adopted by progressive circles in other countries such as Sweden and Russia.A: What did movement incorporate by the mid-1800s?Q: Passage: The formation of the party was formally announced at Sydney Town Hall on 31 August 1945. It took the name \\"Liberal\\" in honour of the old Commonwealth Liberal Party. The new party was dominated by the remains of the old UAP; with few exceptions, the UAP party room became the Liberal party room. The Australian Women's National League, a powerful conservative women's organisation, also merged with the new party. A conservative youth group Menzies had set up, the Young Nationalists, was also merged into the new party. It became the nucleus of the Liberal Party's youth division, the Young Liberals. By September 1945 there were more than 90,000 members, many of whom had not previously been members of any political party.A: Where was the formation of the UAP party officially announced?Q: Passage: Hunting is claimed to give resource managers an important tool in managing populations that might exceed the carrying capacity of their habitat and threaten the well-being of other species, or, in some instances, damage human health or safety.[citation needed] However, in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination habitat and food availability, and hunting for 'population control' has no effect on the annual population of species.[citation needed] In some cases, it can increase the population of predators such as coyotes by removing territorial bounds that would otherwise be established, resulting in excess neighbouring migrations into an area, thus artificially increasing the population. Hunting advocates[who?] assert that hunting reduces intraspecific competition for food and shelter, reducing mortality among the remaining animals. Some environmentalists assert[who?] that (re)introducing predators would achieve the same end with greater efficiency and less negative effect, such as introducing significant amounts of free lead into the environment and food chain.A:","answer":"What does animal migration help resource managers do?"},{"question":"Q: In this task, you are given a multiple-choice question about healthcare.

The regular size rubber ducks are 3.00 each and the large size rubber duck is 5.00 each. All of the rubber ducks will be dropped into the river at the same time and the first duck that floats across the finish line wins. They sold 221 regular size ducks and 185 large size ducks. How much money did the city raise for charity?Answer: They sold 221 regular size rubber ducks at 3.00 each so they made 221 * 3 = 663.00. They sold 185 large rubber ducks at 5.00 each so they made 185 * 5 = 925.00. The regular size ducks brought in 663.00 and the large brought in 925.00 for a total of 663 + 925 = 1,588.00 for charity.

If he purchased two rackets that were each originally marked at a full price of 60, how much did he spend on the two rackets, in dollars?[Answer]Half off the full price of 60 is 60 / 2 = 30 off.

So, this means 120 / 10 = 12 boxes of soda must be purchased. Thus, it will amount to 2 x 12 = 24. Therefore, each family member will pay 24 / 6 = 4.

I contacted the seller to get a return authorization response within the 30 day window. They never responded until I filed an amazon claim.

This is advertized on the package as \\"you can swap batteries in a snap\\". It was difficult to get the battery in, and required a small flathead screwdriver to pry it back out (the screw is a phillips, so you need to take an extra flathead with you). Not what I would call \\"a snap\\".The original nintendo battery goes in and comes out of the battery compartment easily.#2 - The packaging claims \\"up to 3 hours extra play time\\". I have not tested the battery because of #1, but my son has played for well over 5 hours on the original nintendo battery without requiring a recharge.#3 - nintendo offers a replacement battery that is supposed to be the same as the one included with the ds lite for 15 plus shipping.(Answer)decreaseQues: You are considering whether to buy a product.

It is totally worthless and I think it made the problem worse. One of our 9 month old twin as soon as it could stand, discovered that the crib rail is a perfect teething toy... After reviewing various products we selected the Kidkusion Gummi Crib Rail. We followed all the instructions for installation but the product does not work. Our kid can just fit his bottom teeth (he only has these 2) between the crib rail and the side of the cushion and continue to scrap the crib rail. And now that the top part of the rail is cushioned, I think he enjoys it even more... So this product does not protect our son from continuing to scrap the crib finish and ingest it.

Step-by-step reasoning process: First find the total number of people by adding the number of passengers and flight crew: 30 people + 5 people = 35 people. Then find the total number of bags by doubling the total number of people: 35 people * 2 bags / person = 70 bags. Then find the fuel increase caused by the people by multiplying their number by the fuel increase per person: 35 people * 3 gallons / mile / person = 105 gallons / mile. Then multiply the number of bags by the fuel increase per bag to find the total fuel increase they cause: 70 bags * 2 gallons / mile / bag = 140 gallons / mile. Now add the fuel increases to the base fuel consumption to find the total fuel needed per mile: 140 gallons / mile + 105 gallons / mile + 20 gallons / mile = 265 gallons / mile. Now multiply the fuel consumption per mile by the number of miles flown to find the total amount of fuel needed: 265 gallons / mile * 400 miles = 106,000 gallons of fuel.

Calhoun of South Carolina. The land that Springfield now occupies was originally settled by trappers and traders who came to the Sangamon River in 1818. The settlement's first cabin was built in 1820, by John Kelly. It was located at what is now the northwest corner of Second Street and Jefferson Street. In 1821, Calhoun became the county seat of Sangamon County due to fertile soil and trading opportunities. Settlers from Kentucky, Virginia, and as far as North Carolina came to the city. By 1832, Senator Calhoun had fallen out of the favor with the public and the town renamed itself Springfield after Springfield, Massachusetts. At that time, Springfield, Massachusetts was comparable to modern-day Silicon Valley -- known for industrial innovation, concentrated prosperity, and the celebrated Springfield Armory. Most importantly, it was a city that had built itself up from frontier outpost to national power through ingenuity -- an example that the newly named Springfield, Illinois, sought to emulate. Kaskaskia was the first capital of the Illinois Territory from its organization in 1809, continuing through statehood in 1818, and through the first year as a state in 1819. Vandalia was the second state capital of Illinois from 1819 to 1839. Springfield became the third and current capital of Illinois in 1839. The designation was largely due to the efforts of Abraham Lincoln and his associates; nicknamed the \\"Long Nine\\" for their combined height of 54 feet (16 m).Question: when did springfield become the capital of illinois?Stream of random thoughts: To answer this question, we should know that: Springfield became the third and current capital of Illinois in 1839....

Follow the example to solve a new instance of the task.Combine the given two facts to write a concluding fact. Note that there should be some parts of the first and second facts that are not mentioned in this conclusion fact. Your combined fact should be the result of a chain between the two facts. Chains form when two facts connect together to produce a concluding fact. An example of a chain is: \\"pesticides cause pollution\\" (fact1) + \\"pollution can harm animals\\" (fact2) → \\"pesticides can harm animals\\" (conclusion fact). Parts of the concluding fact overlap with the first and the second fact. To construct such a  concluding fact, a useful way is to borrow the subject from one fact and the ending conclusions from another fact.Fact1: pesticides cause pollution. Fact2: pollution can harm animals.Solution: pesticides can harm animals.Why? This is a good concluding fact that is entailed from combining Fact1 and Fact2. Also, it does not contain everything present in Fact1 and Fact2.New input: Fact 1: a ship is used for moving people across bodies of water.

ExampleContext: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogeneous disease with an uncertain pathogenesis. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 ± 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03). ILC2s were also correlated with worsening nasal symptom score in CRS (P = 0.04).Answer: As ILC2s are elevated in patients with CRSwNP, they may drive nasal polyp formation in CRS. ILC2s are also linked with high tissue and blood eosinophilia and have a potential role in the activation and survival of eosinophils during the Th2 immune response. The association of innate lymphoid cells in CRS provides insights into its pathogenesis.Answer: Are group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) increased in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or eosinophilia?Explanation: The question is based on the following sentences from the two passages (i) Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) {ii) In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (iii) As ILC2s are elevated in patients with CRSwNP, they may drive nasal polyp formation in CRS. and (iv) ILC2s are also linked with high tissue and blood eosinophilia.Part 3. ExerciseContext: We examined whether the presence and extent of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) predict adverse outcomes in nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) patients.', 'Morbidity and mortality is high in NICM patients. However, the clinical course of an individual patient is unpredictable and current risk stratification approaches are limited. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance detects myocardial fibrosis, which appears as LGE after contrast administration and may convey prognostic importance.', 'In a prospective cohort study, 65 NICM patients with left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction < or =35% underwent CMR before placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. The CMR images were analyzed for the presence and extent of LGE and for LV function, volumes, and mass. Patients were followed for an index composite end point of 3 cardiac events: hospitalization for heart failure, appropriate ICD firing, and cardiac death.', 'A total of 42% (n = 27) of patients had CMR LGE, averaging 10 +/- 13% of LV mass. During a 17-month median follow-up, 44% (n = 12) of patients with LGE had an index composite outcome event versus only 8% (n = 3) of those without LGE (p < 0.001 for Kaplan-Meier survival curves). After adjustment for LV volume index and functional class, patients with LGE had an 8-fold higher risk of experiencing the primary outcome (hazard ratio 8.2, 95% confidence interval 2.2 to 30.9; p = 0.002).Answer: A CMR LGE in NICM patients strongly predicts adverse cardiac outcomes. The CMR LGE may represent the end-organ consequences of sustained adrenergic activation and adverse LV remodeling, and its identification may significantly improve risk stratification strategies in this high risk population.

Your task is to generate question for given answer based on set of context paragraphs, supporting facts and an answer.Context_1 : Tian Jiyun (; born June 1929 in Feicheng, Shandong) is a politician in the People's Republic of China, known as a supporter of Deng Xiaoping's reforms. The best-known feature of his biography is the speech of 1992, delivered in the Central Party School, in which he ridicules the \\"leftists\\" (those who did not support the new policy of openness). Tian proposed they establish their own \\"economic zones\\" preserving all the worst features of the old system. Context_2 : Bob Fu () is a Chinese American pastor. He is the founder and president since 2002 of China Aid, which provides legal aid to Christians in China. Bob Fu was born in Shandong in 1968 and studied English literature at Liaocheng University in the 1980s. He converted to Christianity after an American teacher gave him a biography of a Chinese Christian convert. After his studies, Fu taught English at the Central Party School in Beijing while participating in the house church movement. In 1996, Bob Fu and his family emigrated to Hong Kong and then the United States, after his wife became pregnant without the government permission to have a child. Fu founded the China Aid Association in Philadelphia in 2002, but moved its headquarters to Midland, Texas in 2004. Fu is also known for his role in helping negotiate barefoot lawyer Chen Guangcheng's immigration to the United States; in this sense, has been described as a \\"liaison\\" between oppressed groups in China and foreign governments or media that can help them. Context_3 : Feicheng (肥城 ; pinyin: \\"Féichéng\\") is a city of Tai'an in the Chinese province of Shandong. Context_4 : Shaolin Kung Fu (), also called Shaolin Wushu () or Shaolin quan (), is one of the oldest, largest, and most famous styles of Chinese martial arts. It combines Zen Buddhism and martial arts and originated and was developed in the Shaolin temple in Henan province, China during its 1500-year history. In Chinese folklore, there are famous sayings \\"All martial arts under heaven originated from Shaolin\\" and \\"Shaolin kung fu is the best under heaven,\\" which, though not provable, indicate and appraise the influence and place of Shaolin kung fu among martial arts. The name Shaolin is also used as a brand for the so-called external styles of kung fu. Many styles in southern and northern China use the name Shaolin. Context_5 :    (; Foochow Romanized: Hók-ăng-chê; sometimes \\"Fu An\\") is a county-level city of Ningde prefecture level city, in northeast Fujian province, PRC, some 150 km away from the provincial capital Fuzhou. Context_6 : Feicheng Acid Chemicals () is a chemical company based in Feicheng, Shandong, China. Context_7 : Fu Baoshi Memorial is located at 132nd Hankou West Road in Nanjing, China, where Fu Baoshi, a great art master born in 1904, lived. Not only did Fu create large amounts of Chinese painting and carving works but he also taught many talented artists. The tip of his writing brush is unique which is called \\"Baoshi Cun\\" by people. It was not until 1965 when he died that he gained more widespread recognition. During the Cultural Revolution, all the offspring he had were driven out of their home and then were scattered all around the world. In 1958, in memory of the 20-year anniversary of Fu’s death, the government contributed to maintaining the old house and planned to build a memorial for Fu Baoshi. This memorial opened in 1987. Its first curator was Fu Ershi—Fu, Baoshi’s son. Context_8 : Ma Jikong () (1914–2001) was a People's Republic of China politician. He was born in Feicheng, Tai'an, Shandong. He was People's Congress Chairman of Jiangxi. He was a delegate to the 2nd National People's Congress and 6th National People's Congress. Context_9 : Kung Fu San Soo (功夫散手) is a martial art based on techniques from all over China, both Northern and Southern Chinese martial arts systems. The 5 Family Fist (五家拳) is an important part of San Soo, and is commonly practiced in the Taishan region of the Guangdong province. Kung Fu San Soo as taught in China has many traditional forms and isometric exercises in its training regimen. Chin Siu Dek (Jimmy H. Woo), the man responsible for bringing Kung Fu San Soo to America, did not believe in the animal styles and hence taught only the 5 family styles (蔡李何佛雄). His words were, \\"We fight like men, not animals.\\" The name \\"Kung Fu San Soo\\" itself was chosen by Woo to simplify the pronunciation and meaning for American students, rather than using the complete names of the 5 families. Kung Fu San Soo originated for use in military combat and uses techniques designed to swiftly disable an attacker. Due to the fact San Soo is a practical martial art for self-defense and the techniques are intended for real fight scenarios, there are no competitions or tournaments for San Soo Kung Fu. Context_10 : Shandong Energy Group Company is a state owned coal-mining company headquartered in Jinan, Shandong, China. It is among the seven largest Chinese coal companies. The group was created in March 2011 by merging six existing coal mining companies.

For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes . Essentially, enzymes are biological catalysts.

I love knowing how far I've walked with my son while pushing him in the stroller (especially since, like most new moms, I've got a little extra poundage to lose) but I'm already on my last magnet (the Strollometer comes with 3), despite following the instructions carefully. (Yes, I wiped the spot down with the alcohol wipe!) I also had to duck tape the sensor so it wouldn't move around while the stroller bounced along bumpy sidewalks. But considering this is the only product for this purpose (nevermind that it also comes with so many great features: time! temperature! distance! and an option to measure in metric, too!) and it works well most of the time, I'll give it 4 stars.

His theme, like his other two books, is basically about all his acquisitions. If you truly are looking for a book about the inside secrets of negotiations, business practices, and real estate finance, don't buy this book.

The first word is called the 'concept' and the second word is called the 'relatum' The relation must be one of the following: co-hyponym (coordinate), hypernym, meronym, attribute, event, or random. A coordinate relation indicates that the concept and relatum belong to the same semantic class. A hypernym relation indicates that the relatum is a category of which the concept is a specific instance. A meronym relation implies that relatum is a part/component/organ/member of the concept. An attribute relation is when the relatum is an adjective expressing an attribute of the concept. An event relation holds when the relatum is a verb referring to an action/activity/happening/event that is performed by or with the concept. If the relatum and concept are unrelated, the relation between them is 'random'. Classify your answers into coord, hyper, mero, attri, event, and random.Example input: Concept: alligator, Relatum: lizard.Example output: coordExample explanation: Alligator and lizard belong to the same semantic class of reptiles, so the relation is coordinate.Q: Concept: butterfly, Relatum: ant.A:","answer":"coord"},{"question":"Consider the question.

The sound waves from its siren travel outward in all directions. Because the car is racing forward (toward the right), the sound waves get bunched up in front of the car and spread out behind it. As the car approaches the person on the right (position B), the sound waves get closer and closer together. In other words, they have a higher frequency. This makes the siren sound higher in pitch. After the car speeds by the person on the left (position A), the sound waves get more and more spread out, so they have a lower frequency. This makes the siren sound lower in pitch. A change in the frequency of sound waves, relative to a stationary listener, when the source of the sound waves is moving is called the Doppler effect . You’ve probably experienced the Doppler effect yourself. The next time a vehicle with a siren races by, listen for the change in pitch. For an online animation of the Doppler effect, go to the URL below.  Paragraph: John was sitting at point C near a railway track. Suddenly, he heard a train coming towards him from point A with constant sound of its horn. Eventually, it reached very close to him at point B. Then the train sped by him at point C where he was sitting, reaching point D after some time. Finally, it reached even farther from him at point E.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which point would have lower frequency, point D or point E?----Answer: point EQ: Background: East Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. Weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the centre cold and dry. Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, ice there lasts for extended periods. Heavy snowfalls are common on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22 metres (48 in) in 48 hours have been recorded.  Paragraph: Two scientists went to Antarctica for research. Tim was assigned to East Antarctica, while John was assigned to West Antarctica. They spent 6 months there.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which scientist was located at a lower elevation?A: JohnQuestion: Background: Weather conditions include air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, \\"if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change.\\" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming. The effects of global warming are already being seen. Treaties and voluntary actions are needed to reduce emissions to lessen the amount of global warming that will take place in the future.  Paragraph: Two neighbors attended the same school. Mike learned about  biology while Dan learned more about the weather. They both were among the best in the school.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person read more about humidity?Answer: Dan[Q]: Background: For example, if a circuit has a potential difference of 100 volts and it is intended for the circuit to contain a 100 ohm resistance, then the wires carrying the current for this circuit will be designed for 1.0 amp. If that 100 ohm resistance is suddenly cut out of the circuit and only 0.10 ohm resistance remains, then the voltage will push 1000 amps of current through the circuit. This current overheats the wires and may damage the circuits or start a fire in the walls or the appliance. There are many possible causes of a short circuit, one possible cause could be something overheating, melting wires, and thereby fusing the circuit closed, bypassing the resistance. Another cause might be something damaging the insulation of a wire, allowing the incoming and grounds wires to touch. In any case, once the resistance is lost, the voltage pushes a huge amount of charge through the wires causing them to overheat.  Paragraph: John is preparing for a do it yourself science project. First, he made a circuit with adequate resistance. He labeled that state of the circuit as circuit A. Then he lowered the resistance. He called that new state of the circuit as circuit B. While he was doing all this, his friend Keith showed up with another circuit, circuit C. But that circuit's insulation was damaged.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which circuit would have higher temperature, circuit A or circuit B?[A]: circuit Binput: Please answer the following: Background: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.  Paragraph: Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which crop would be more beneficial to farmers, crop A or crop B?++++++++++output: crop ABackground: Because of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights. This is because clouds (H2O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations.  Paragraph: David was visiting Europe last summer. First he visited London. To his dismay, it was overcast all night. Then he flew to Rome. There the sky was as clear as you could get at night. David was very happy about it.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which place the Earth's surface would cool down faster, London or Rome?----Answer:","answer":"Rome"},{"question":"Given the task definition, example input & output, solve the new input case.You're given a fill-in-the-blank question where the answer is PersonX.

Your task is to summarize them.   Elizabeth Peña, left, and Esai Morales in a scene from Showtime’s “Resurrection Blvd.” Peña, who won an ALMA for her work on the show, died Tuesday at age 55. (Photo by Randy Tepper / Showtime)    Elizabeth Peña, the actress known for her roles in “La Bamba,” “Rush Hour,” “The Incredibles,” “Jacob’s Ladder,” and “Lone Star,” died Tuesday in Los Angeles after a short illness. She was 55.    The news was first reported by Peña’s nephew, Mario-Francisco Robles, in a post for Latino Review. Peña’s manager, Gina Rugolo, confirmed the actress’s death in a statement. Neither elaborated further on the cause of death. Robles followed Peña’s professional accomplishments with a personal appreciation for his aunt:    She did it all, and she made it look fun. She made it look easy. But I know it wasn’t. I know she had a drive like no other, and that she was a force to be reckoned with when she decided it was time to make it big or … well, nothing. She never considered an alternative. Her singular focus was breathtaking, and awe-inspiring. Tonight, my family is heartbroken. There’s now a void that will never be filled. All we can do now is remember your sharp sense of humor, your endless hunger for life, and your never ending pursuit of happiness. You were a great mother, wife, daughter, sister, and cousin. But you’ll always be my Ñaña, #1 in a category all your own.    In a 35-year career, Peña developed a penchant for oozing an understated, intelligent sensuality with ease. Though rarely a leading lady, she brought a certain magnetism to all of her roles. She was a patient, unflappable therapist in “Transamerica,” and a sultry but well-intentioned seductress in “The Incredibles,” in which she played Mirage.    “News of Elizabeth Pena’s death hits particularly hard, for some reason, maybe because she was consistently outstanding in everything,” tweeted Matt Zoller Seitz, editor-in-chief of RogerEbert.com.        In a Twitter conversation Wednesday night, actress and producer Eva Longoria said Peña wasn’t just a Cuban-American actress — for many years, she was the Latina Actress. When Peña joined the Director’s Guild of America, she was only the fourth to do so. In 1987, Peña starred in the television show “I Married Dora” as a Salvadoran housekeeper who entered a green-card marriage with her employer to remain in the country.    Peña went on to play a wide range of roles that were far from typical; her characters felt vibrant and bubbled with humanity. In the charming and funny “How the Garcia Girls Spent Their Summer,” she played a mother in her forties experiencing a sexual reawakening opposite America Ferrera and Lucy Gallardo. Peña won ALMA awards for her work in “Tortilla Soup,” “Resurrection Blvd.,” “Rush Hour” and “Contagious.”    “Rest in Peace Elizabeth Pena … you paved the way for so many of us!!” Longoria tweeted.    Peña was aware of her role as a Latina groundbreaker and role model, and she also realized she was called upon to occupy this blurry, amorphous space as a Latina actress. She played Gloria’s Colombian mother on “Modern Family.” In “Lone Star,” she was a teacher on the U.S.-Mexico border.    “In the United States, all Spanish-speaking people are lumped into one category,” Peña told the Dallas Morning News in 1996 (via the Los Angeles Times). “But we’re all so different. Argentinians are completely different from Mexicans. Mexicans are completely different from Cubans. Cubans are completely different from people from Paraguay and Uruguay.”    On Wednesday night, Peña’s friends and colleagues expressed shock and grief and paid tribute to her on social media.    “My heart breaks,” tweeted Wilson Cruz. “She was FANTASTIC!”    “Q triste lo de #ElizabethPena era una dama con mucha alma!” John Leguizamo tweeted. In English: “It’s sad about Elizabeth Peña, a lady with a lot of soul.”    The entire cast and crew are very sad to say goodbye to one of our Modern Family members.

I thought it was an unusually gloomy day in LA. I could feel a deep sadness in my bones,” Peña’s “Resurrection Blvd.” co-star, Esai Morales, said in a Facebook post.    He continued: “I just can’t believe she’s gone … I remember crushing on Liz back in our High School days and being inspired by her work and success in this ever so fickle and peculiar business. So you can imagine how happy and privileged I felt to be able to work on screen together (and steal her away from Ritchie…!!)    “Trying to write something deserving of her memory and her larger than life personality isn’t easy through bouts of laughter and tears; but what can I say … ? She was our first — and only, Elizabeth Peña … an artist with a truly gifted soul and a wicked sense of humor. A straight shooter who was uniquely fun, funny and always a pleasure to work with and just be around. A great gal who is gone too soon.”    Loading RIP #ElizabethPeña. An actress I grew up admiring & had the pleasure of working with & hiring on Nothing Like The Holidays. A consummate professional with razor sharp wit. One of the greats. You will be missed. View on Instagram    Recently, Pena just finished work playing Maritza Sandoval on the first season of the El Rey network show “Matador.”    “We are deeply saddened by the passing of our friend and colleague, Elizabeth Peña,” the network said in a statement. “She was a role model, a truly extraordinary performer and an inspiration in every sense of the word. Our thoughts are with Elizabeth’s family and friends during this difficult time.

The opposite direction of circulation is due to the Coriolis effect. Tropical cyclones typically form over large bodies of relatively warm water. They derive their energy through the evaporation of water from the ocean surface, which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when moist air rises and cools to saturation. This energy source differs from that of mid-latitude cyclonic storms, such as nor'easters and European windstorms, which are fueled primarily by horizontal temperature contrasts. Tropical cyclones are typically between 100 and 2,000 km (62 and 1,243 mi) in diameter.Where does a tropical cyclone or hurricane get its energy?Solution:OK... To answer the question, consider the following: They derive their energy through the evaporation of water from the ocean surface, which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when moist air rises and cools to saturation.the evaporation of water from the ocean surface , which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when moist air rises and cools to saturation.Student A:Passage: On 8 August 1942, the All India Congress Committee passed the Quit India resolution at the Bombay session.

How much do the patches for the quilt cost?Answer: The patch is 16 * 20 = 320 square feet. So he needs 320 / 4 = 80 patches. The first 10 patches cost 10 * 10 = 100. He gets a discount on the next 80 - 10 = 70 patches. They each cost 10 / 2 = 5. So in total they cost 70 * 5 = 350. That means in total he paid 100 + 350 = 450.

She needed a few things from the grocery store and bought the following: 2 pounds of hamburger meat that was on sale for 3.50 a pound. 1 pack of hamburger buns for 1.50. A head of lettuce for 1.00 and a large 1.5-pound tomato that was priced at 2.00 per pound. She also needed a jar of pickles that cost 2.50 and she had a 1.00 off coupon for that item. How much change would Lauren get back if she paid with a 20 bill?A: She bought 2 pounds of hamburger meat at 3.50 per pound so 2 * 3.50 = 7.00. The tomato weighed 1.5 pounds and cost 2.00 per pound so 1.5 * 2 = 3.00. When you add up all her items she spent 7 + 1.50 + 1 + 3 + 2.50 = 15.00. Her items added up to 15.00 and she had a 1.00 coupon off pickles so 15 - 1 = 14.00. She paid with a 20.00 bill so 20 - 14 = 6.00 in change. The answer is 6.Question: Jerry files a lawsuit against the convenience store where he works and slipped and fell.

If he gets 80% of what he's asking for, for much money does he get?Answer: First find the total cost of Jerry's lost salary: 50,000 / year * 30 years = 1,500,000. Then add the cost of the medical bills: 1,500,000 + 200,000 = 1,700,000. Then triple that number to find the cost of the punitive damages: 1,700,000 * 3 = 5,100,000. Then add the cost of the medical and salary damages to find how much Jerry asked for: 1,700,000 + 5,100,000 = 6,800,000. Then multiply that number by 80% to find how much money Jerry is awarded: 6,800,000 * 80% = 5,440,000. The answer is 5440000.[Question]Mark realizes that a lot of the friends on his friends list are people he doesn't talk to anymore. He keeps 40% of his friends list and then contacts the rest. Of those only 50% respond. He removes everyone who did not respond. If he had 100 friends how many does he have left after the removal?[Answer]He contacted 1 - .4 = .6 of his friends. So he contacted 100 * .6 = 60 people. So he removes 60 / 2 = 30 people. So he has 100 - 30 = 70 friends left. The answer is 70.[Question]A factory produces 90 refrigerators per hour. It also produces 70 more coolers than refrigerators per hour. How many products did the factory produce for 5 days if it works 9 hours a day?[Answer]","answer":"The factory produces 90 + 70 = 160 coolers per hour. The factory works 5 * 9 = 45 hours in 5 days. The factory produces ( 90 + 160) * 45 = 11250 products for 5 days. The answer is 11250."},{"question":"You are given a sentence in Arabic.

Once the axle was replaced they gave her the run around about the alignment and could not get it to track straight.   We took it back for the alignment to be done...not to mention they did not blend the paint to match the rest of the vehicle until we complained about it and they took it back to repaint the other surrounding areas so the hood would not stand out as new paint at the same time we took it back to look at the alignment again.   My girlfriend mentioned that the Jeep was swaying and not tracking straight. They said they \\"fixed it\\" and gave it back once the the paint was done. The Jeep still pulled to the left and she was just so frustrated that she didn't want to go back to them and do it.   We haven't driven the Jeep much lately and when I was driving it last week on the freeway I noticed the Jeep was swaying back and forth a little bit. It felt like like it was tracking left and right. The steering wheel had just a little slop left to right with the sway. Then yesterday while driving home from work the entire Jeep was swaying back and forth. We had to come to a complete stop. I checked under the front end believing something came loose and noticed that the rear track bar bracket on the axle side was hanging to the ground. The bracket broke off.   There was no way this bracket just decided to let loose for no reason. There is no doubt in my mind that this bracket was already on its way out after the accident. There are three sides of the bracket that are welded to the axle. The left side was completely torn off clean. The right was bent out an inch, and the bottom part of the bracket itself was a straight rip. This tells me that the axle was already shifted over to the passenger side after the accident happened and broke the weld on the left, bent the right and started to rip the bottom part off.   So this whole time the swaying feeling was the axle trying to center itself under the Jeep since the rear track bar was about to rip off the axle.   How did they not catch this? Did then even look over the entire Jeep, or just the front end?  You don't have to understand Jeeps, 4x4 vehicles, how trackbars work, or anything else here other than the fact that this bracket breaking at high speeds could have killed us. My question to them would be whether they gave the whole Jeep a solid look over. Just because the accident is in the front doesn't mean you neglect the rear. Or does it?  The Jeep drove perfect before the accident, never tracked to the left, and never swayed at high speeds. I stand by my review that the bracket was over looked and this could have cost us our lives. Imagine, just imagine if this bracket broke off on the highway at 75 instead of the streets at 45?   The best part is that the guy(s) working on the Jeep made her feel comfortable about their skills and working with Jeeps as they were Jeep guys and liked off-roading. Again you don't need to know Jeeps to know how to do your job and give a vehicle a full shake down before you sign off on the repairs being completed.

As the city's commerce improved, residents worked to restore or create community institutions. In 1865, the Avery Normal Institute was established by the American Missionary Association as the first free secondary school for Charleston's African American population. General William T. Sherman lent his support to the conversion of the United States Arsenal into the Porter Military Academy, an educational facility for former soldiers and boys left orphaned or destitute by the war.

Review: I bought the Boss stick vacuum and the Featherweight vacuum because they were both priced the same and I couldn't decide between them. The Featherweight model had a lot of rave reviews about it but, having bought and used both, I think the Boss vacuum is SO MUCH better! The Boss's handle telescopes back into the unit; the Featherweight detaches. The Boss vacuum has more pick-up ability. The floor attachment of the Featherweight, when used on short carpet,lifts up on the backstroke; the Boss model does not. I put the Boss model in our R.V. to do quick pick-ups while on our trips (we bring our cats and needed a vacuum to get up cat litter as well as dirt)what a lifesaver!!! I kept the Featherweight in our house to do stairs and quick small clean-up jobs on our tile floor but, I wish it was a Boss model instead then I'd be really happy!!!!

When the war concluded, Mexico relinquished its claim on Texas, as well as other regions in what is now the southwestern United States. Texas' annexation as a state that tolerated slavery had caused tension in the United States among slave states and those that did not allow slavery.

This tray fits the purpose to a \\"T\\". It easily holds my entire 11 piece set of knives plus the sharpening tool. The only piece it won't hold are the poltry scissors, which I just place in a tray next to it. It is not a big deal to me that the scissors won't fit.

Answer:OPTIONS:- No- Yesoutput: YesQ: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: The chain was cut using bolt-cutters in broad daylight on a busy street; this is no security whatsoever. I had two bikes locked to a street bike rack using the 5019. I bought the lock because of its reputation and the associated warranty (theoretically up to 3001 US).The support from the distributor (Todson Inc./OnGuard Locks USA) has been appalling!- It took four months and many, many calls (eliciting weak excuses for inactivity) before they came back with a cash offer of 750 - for a bike orginally discounted from 1800 to 1500 - that is less than 1 year old and in perfect condition. The second bike, although not stated in the warranty registration, is not covered at all because it is \\"a second bike attached to the same lock\\".- In summary, the warranty is not worth the paper it is written on.

I was unaware that I should unplug the transmitter after charging it for no more than 4 hours. If it is plugged in for more than that, the battery begins to lose its ability to maintain a charge.

This LP book on Vietnam though, does not live up to the standards of other LP travel books!I lived in Vietnam for three months this past summer. Going through the book, I found out that key details about travel services were missing, maps were wrong, and restaurant recommendations were off the mark. An example of how the book was not up to par: I wanted to plan a trip to Bach Ma National Park while in Hue. Once I arrived, I realized the descriptions of the trails in the book were almost word for word copies of the free trailmap given out to tourist!

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Answer:Positive(Question)Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Why? Review: The one question that keep's running through my mind is, Why did this guy join the Legion? Reading \\"Mouthful of Rocks\\" is like looking into the mind of a little boy who, while playing \\"soldier\\", gets upset and decides to take his toys and go home. I enjoyed reading the book, but not for the reason's I had hoped to. The book has little to do with life in the Legion, but has everything to do with Mr. Jennings seeming life long quest to blame everyone and everything around him for the decisions he makes. From page one, he seem's to want us to know that he is irresponsibile, childish, and a drunk. It is no secret that life in the Legion is hard, but Mr. Jennings goes out of his way to make it even harder. Constant disregard of orders, joining a clique of racist's, and avid drinking all point to the only ending this book could have; the little boy running away. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone with an intrest in the Legion, but any intrested in a childish mind would find it a great read.

The book contains articles from all points of view and also offers articles that do not have certain positions, but rather just report the current situation in the US and around the world. There are chapters that discuss the history of this threat all the way to whether we as a nation are prepared for this type of attack.

Jake can row at twice the speed he can swim. It takes him 20 minutes to swim 1 mile. How long, in hours, does it take to row the lake?Answer: The perimeter of the lake is 4 * 15 = 60 miles. He swims at a speed of 60 / 20 = 3 mph. So he rows at a speed of 3 * 2 = 6 mph. That means it takes him 60 / 6 = 10 hours to row around the lake. The answer is 10.[Question]Bonny just bought her 13th pair of shoes, which is 5 less than twice as many pairs of shoes as Becky owns. Bobby has 3 times as many pairs of shoes as Becky has. How many shoes does Bobby have?[Answer]Let x be the number of pairs of shoes that Becky owns. Since 13 pairs is 5 less than twice as many pairs as Becky owns, then the relationship is 2x - 5 = 13. Adding 5 to each side of the equation, we get 2x = 18. Solving for x, we get x = 9. Since Bobby has 3 times as many pairs of shoes as Becky has, then Becky has 3 * 9 = 27 pairs of shoes. The answer is 27.Q: Brandon has been fired from half the businesses in town and has quit from a third of them. If there are 72 business in town, how many businesses can he still apply to?A: First divide the total number of businesses by 2 to find how many businesses Brandon hasn't been fired from: 72 businesses / 2 = 36 businesses. Then divide the total number of businesses by 3 to find how many businesses Brandon quit from: 72 businesses / 3 = 24 businesses. Then subtract that number from the number of businesses he hasn't been fired from to find the number of businesses where he can still apply: 36 businesses - 24 businesses = 12 businesses. The answer is 12.Question: Dana normally drinks a 500 ml bottle of soda each day. Since the 500 ml bottles are currently out of stock at the store, she buys a 2-liter bottle of soda instead. If Dana continues to drink 500 ml of soda each day, how long will the 2-liter bottle of soda last? There are 1,000 ml in 1 liter.Answer: There are 2 * 1,000 ml = 2,000 ml in a 2 - liter bottle of soda. A 2 - liter bottle of soda lasts 2,000 / 500 = 4 days. The answer is 4.[Question]Shannon bought 5 pints of frozen yogurt, two packs of chewing gum, and five trays of jumbo shrimp from The Food Place for a total of 55 If the price of a tray of jumbo shrimp is 5 and a pack of chewing gum costs half as much as a pint of frozen yogurt, what is the price of a pint of frozen yogurt?[Answer]5 trays of jumbo shrimp cost 5 x 5 = 25. 5 pints of frozen yogurt and 2 packs of gum in total cost 55 - 25 = 30. 2 packs of gum cost as much 2 / 2 = 1 pint of frozen yogurt. Therefore 5 + 1 = 6 pints of frozen yogurt costs 30. A pint of frozen yogurt costs 30 / 6 = 5. The answer is 5.[Question]Gerald spends 100 a month on baseball supplies. His season is 4 months long.

Your task is to generate label \\"yes\\" if title is right for article, otherwise generate \\"no\\".Q: Abstract: Chronic inflammation is a known risk factor for tumorigenesis, yet the precise mechanism of this association is currently unknown. The inflammasome, a multiprotein complex formed by NOD-like receptor (NLR) family members, has recently been shown to orchestrate multiple innate and adaptive immune responses, yet its potential role in inflammation-induced cancer has been little studied. Using the azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate colitis-associated colorectal cancer model, we show that caspase-1-deficient (Casp1(-/-)) mice have enhanced tumor formation. Surprisingly, the role of caspase-1 in tumorigenesis was not through regulation of colonic inflammation, but rather through regulation of colonic epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis. Consequently, caspase-1-deficient mice demonstrate increased colonic epithelial cell proliferation in early stages of injury-induced tumor formation and reduced apoptosis in advanced tumors. We suggest a model in which the NLRC4 inflammasome is central to colonic inflammation-induced tumor formation through regulation of epithelial cell response to injury..

The Ojeda family is celebrating Maggie Ojedas (Andolong) debut. In the garden, Trining (Gil) receives her first kiss from Miguel Lorenzo (Torre), her childhood sweetheart. Don Claudio Ojeda (Ojeda) and his fellow landowners talk about war. The youngest guests mock Miguels refusal to join the army and brand him mamas boy. The celebration is cut short by news of the fall of the Corregidor. As war nears the city, the Ojedas accept the invitation extended by the Lorenzos, their old family friends, to stay with them in their provincial hacienda. Nena Ojeda (Lorena) and Inday Lorenzo (Asensio) try to deny the realities of war by preserving their pre-war lifestyle. Pining for her fiancé, Maggie goes through bouts of melancholy. Miguel and Trining turn from naughty children into impetuous adults.Two more family friends a doctor, Jo Russell (Valdez), guerillas and Viring (Villanueva) join them. As the enemy advance, the families move to the Lorenzos forest lodge. A group of weary guerillas arrive and Jo tends to their injuries. The guerillas leave Hermes Mercurio (Lazaro) behind. Miguel endures more comments of the same kind when he fails to take action against a Japanese soldier who came upon the girls bathing in the river. It is Mercurio who kills the Japanese.

He justifies his action as a reward for his services. He tries his to break the other servants loyalty, but they force Melchor to leave. Later, Melchor and his band of thieves return.

The given question requires more than one sentence to answer. So, your answer must contain at least one comma (\\", \\").Q: Paragraph- Sent 1: The National Security Act of 1947 created the position of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI).Sent 2: Independent from the departments of Defense, State, Justice, and other policy departments, the DCI heads the U.S.intelligence community and provides intelligence to federal entities.Sent 3: The sole element of the intelligence community independent from a cabinet agency is the CIA.Sent 4: As an independent agency, it collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence from all sources.Sent 5: The CIA's number one customer is the president of the United States, who also has the authority to direct it to conduct covert operations.Sent 6: Although covert actions represent a very small fraction of the Agency's entire budget, these operations have at times been controversial and over time have dominated the public's perception of the CIA.Sent 7: The DCI is confirmed by the Senate but is not technically a member of the president's cabinet.Sent 8: The director's power under federal law over the loose, confederated \\"intelligence community\\" is limited.Sent 9: He or she states the community's priorities and coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress.Sent 10: This responsibility gives many the false impression that the DCI has line authority over the heads of these agencies and has the power to shift resources within these budgets as the need arises.Sent 11: Neither is true.Sent 12: In fact, the DCI's real authority has been directly proportional to his personal closeness to the president, which has waxed and waned over the years, and to others in government, especially the secretary of defense.Sent 13: Intelligence agencies under the Department of Defense account for approximately 80 percent of all U.S. spending for intelligence, including some that supports a national customer base and some that supports specific Defense Department or military service needs.Sent 14: As they are housed in the Defense Department, these agencies are keenly attentive to the military's strategic and tactical requirements. Question: Who coordinates development of intelligence agency budget requests for submission to Congress?.A: 7, 8, 9.Q: Paragraph- Sent 1:   The little party in the cabin, so disastrously begun, finished, under the mellowing influence of wine and woman, in excellent feeling and with some hilarity.Sent 2: Mamie, in a plush Gainsborough hat and a gown of wine-coloured silk, sat, an apparent queen, among her rude surroundings and companions.Sent 3: The dusky litter of the cabin set off her radiant trimness: tarry Johnson was a foil to her fair beauty; she glowed in that poor place, fair as a star; until even I, who was not usually of her admirers, caught a spark of admiration; and even the captain, who was in no courtly humour, proposed that the scene should be commemorated by my pencil.Sent 4: It was the last act of the evening.Sent 5: Hurriedly as I went about my task, the half-hour had lengthened out to more than three before it was completed: Mamie in full value, the rest of the party figuring in outline only, and the artist himself introduced in a back view, which was pronounced a likeness.Sent 6: But it was to Mamie that I devoted the best of my attention; and it was with her I made my chief success. Question: What was the last act of the evening?.A: 3, 4, 5.Q: Paragraph- Sent 1: Spring 1944 .Sent 2: Nazi officers want to organize a football match for Hitler 's birthday , in which Germans would play against Hungarian prisoners of war .Sent 3: They call for the famous Hungarian footballer , n di , and order him to organize a team .Sent 4: n di accepts , but in turn demands extra food , a ball with which he and his team can train before the match , and asks that they be allowed to concentrate on training before the match and not work .Sent 5: The Germans accept all the demands , but recommend n di not include any Jews in his team .Sent 6: However , n di ca n't organize the team only from his company , because only 8 out of 98 soldiers can play football .Sent 7: Therefore n di recruits players from the other company .Sent 8: One of the players is Steiner , who is a Jew and ca n't play football .Sent 9: He lied to n di because he was afraid to die .Sent 10: During training the footballers subdue the German corporal guarding them and try to escape .Sent 11: They are soon recaptured and told they will now face probable death penalty .Sent 12: However , the Germans order the Hungarian team to still play the match .Sent 13: At the beginning of the match n di and his team are discouraged , as the Germans easily score three goals .Sent 14: The Hungarians succeed in scoring one goal and the first half ends 3-1 in favor of Germany .Sent 15: At the interval the German commander tells the Hungarians that they might not be executed if they lose the match .Sent 16: The Hungarians refuse to believe this .Sent 17: At the beginning of the second half they score three goals .Sent 18: As a result , during the match , they are executed by the Germans .

Then add that number to the number of pairs of boots she has: 15 pairs + 6 pairs = 21 pairs. Then triple that number to find how many pairs of heels she has: 21 pairs * 3 = 63 pairs. Then add the number of pairs of each kind of shoe she has: 15 pairs + 6 pairs + 63 pairs = 84 pairs.

Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\".

The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous.

But I never sat down to watch it. Because I have this disc added to my collection I finally sat down to watch an Andy Griffith Show. I enjoyed it.I have never seen The Lucy Show before. I thought the only show Lucy was in was I Love Lucy. I thought this was going to be an I Love Lucy Show. Well I enjoyed The Lucy Show. It was a change in what I've seen Lucy in.I've never heard of George Burns and Gracie Allen Show. I enjoyed watching this one though. I liked the way the teen girl and her boyfriend danced in the show. George is a funny guy. I think this was a pretty good show.I've heard of The Dick Van Dyke Show. But I've never seen it before.

Additionally, you're given one answer which is one of the objects present in the question. In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"small\\" to \\"big\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question.

These sac-like structures are held together by the cytoskeleton. The phospholipid membrane encloses the cisternal space (or lumen), which is continuous with the perinuclear space but separate from the cytosol. The functions of the endoplasmic reticulum can be summarized as the synthesis and export of proteins and membrane lipids, but varies between ER and cell type and cell function. The quantity of both rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum in a cell can slowly interchange from one type to the other, depending on the changing metabolic activities of the cell. Transformation can include embedding of new proteins in membrane as well as structural changes. Changes in protein content may occur without noticeable structural changes.Question: Based on this passage, what describes a function of the endoplasmic reticulum within a cell?Solution:OK... The important part for answering this question is: The functions of the endoplasmic reticulum can be summarized as the synthesis and export of proteins and membrane lipids, but varies between ER and cell type and cell function.the synthesis and export of proteins and membrane lipids , but varies between ER and cell type and cell function.Student A:Cell nuclei contain most of the cell's genetic material, organized as multiple long linear DNA molecules in complex with a large variety of proteins, such as histones, to form chromosomes. The genes within these chromosomes are the cell's nuclear genome and are structured in such a way to promote cell function. The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression -- the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell. The main structures making up the nucleus are the nuclear envelope, a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm, and the nuclear matrix (which includes the nuclear lamina), a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support, much like the cytoskeleton, which supports the cell as a whole.Answer this question: why is the nuclues called the control center of the cell?Student B:OK... The relevant information is: The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression -- the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell.The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression.Problem:The name \\"Twins\\" was derived from the popular name of the region, the Twin Cities (Minneapolis and St. Paul). The NBA's Minneapolis Lakers had relocated to Los Angeles in 1960 due to poor attendance which was believed to have been caused in part by the reluctance of fans in St. Paul to support the team. Griffith was determined not to alienate fans in either city by naming the team after one city or the other, so his desire was to name the team the \\"Twin Cities Twins\\", however MLB objected. Griffith therefore named the team the Minnesota Twins. However, the team was allowed to keep its original \\"TC\\" (for Twin Cities) insignia for its caps. The team's logo shows two men, one in a Minneapolis Millers uniform and one in a St. Paul Saints uniform, shaking hands across the Mississippi River within an outline of the state of Minnesota. The \\"TC\\" remained on the Twins' caps until 1987, when they adopted new uniforms. By this time, the team felt it was established enough to put an \\"M\\" on its cap without having St. Paul fans think it stood for Minneapolis. The \\"TC\\" logo was moved to a sleeve on the jerseys, and occasionally appeared as an alternate cap design. Both the \\"TC\\" and \\"Minnie & Paul\\" logos remain the team's primary insignia. As of 2010, the \\"TC\\" logo has been reinstated on the cap as their logo.What does the c in the minnesota twins logo stand for?Solution:OK...

The design is poor and the pole to keep it up is too heavy for the knob that holds it in place so it was not really portable. The high heat setting was very hot and the low heat setting was cold. After the 6th use sparks started to fly from the unit when on high heat. It shorted out completely after the next use. The return policy was less than 30 days, and I wouldnt have been able to get a full refund. Not worth it!!!

Review: I was so excited to purchase two of these for my parents, who are going to be first time grandparents soon. While the devices themselves seem to work OK in that they show the 2 sample pics, the software DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS XP. I wish I had read the \\"fine print\\" of all the customer reviews, because this seems to be a common problem.While the 6Ave policy is to issue replacements only, I actually found a nice person in customer service (Ray) who agreed to give me a refund--I told him that I had tried both, and had read about this being an issue with others, so I didn't want replacements because it wasn't likely they'd work either.It's unfortunate because this seems to be a good product. I see that not everyone has had this problem, so just be aware.

She works for a cosmetics company called Hedare Beauty, which is ready to ship a new skin cream, called Beau-line, that is able to reverse the effects of ageing. However, when Patience visits the factory, she overhears a discussion between the scientist, Dr. Ivan Slavicky, and Laurel Hedare, the wife of company-owner George Hedare, about the dangerous side effects from continued use of the product. Laurel's guards discover Patience and are ordered to dispose of her. Patience tries to escape using a conduit pipe, but the minions have it sealed and flush her out of it, drowning her. Washed up on shore after drowning, Patience is mysteriously brought back to life by an Egyptian Mau cat, which had appeared at her apartment earlier; from that moment on, she develops cat-like abilities.From Mau's owner, eccentric researcher Ophelia Powers, Patience learns that Egyptian Mau cats serve as messengers of the goddess Bast. Patience realizes that she is now a \\"catwoman,\\" reborn with abilities that are both a blessing and a curse. Disguised as Catwoman to hide her identity, Patience, under cover of darkness, searches for answers as to who killed her and why. Eventually, her search (which includes finding Slavicky's body, and later being accused of his murder) leads her to Laurel. She asks Laurel to keep an eye on George, to which Laurel agrees. However, when Patience confronts George (who is at an opera with another woman), he reveals he knows nothing about the side effects. The police, led by Patience's love interest Detective Tom Lone, arrive and Catwoman escapes. Later on, Laurel murders her husband for his infidelity, and admits to having Dr. Slavicky killed because he wanted to cancel the product's release. She contacts Catwoman and frames her for the murder. Catwoman is taken into custody by Tom, but not before Laurel reveals the side-effects of the product: Discontinuing its use makes the skin disintegrate, while continuing its use makes the skin as hard as marble. She also plans to release the Beau-line the following day.Patience slips out of her jail cell, and confronts Laurel in her office, (rescuing Tom, who'd come there to question Laurel after second thoughts about Patience's guilt, in the process), revealing that Laurel is the one responsible for her death. During the fight, she scratches Laurel's face, and Laurel falls out of a window, grabbing onto a pipe for her life. Laurel sees her face in a window's reflection and, horrified by her skin's rapid disintegration, fails to grab hold of Patience's outstretched arm and falls to her death. Though Patience is cleared of any charges made against her regarding the deaths of Dr. Slavicky and the Hedares, she decides to end things with Tom, choosing to continue living outside the law and enjoying her new-found freedom as the mysterious Catwoman.[A]: What brings Patience back to life?[Q]: Howard Hallenbeck (David Dukes) travels to Ireland to research items of religious significance. He goes to a rural church to photograph some graves. Meanwhile, three farmers are attempting to remove an ominous stone column from a field. Two of the farmers head home. A thunderstorm appears out of nowhere, and smoke pours from the ground. Lightning strikes the column. The monster Rawhead Rex rises from the dirt.Howard meets Declan O'Brien (Ronan Wilmot), who directs him to Reverend Coot. The curious O'Brien approaches the altar and places his hand on it. Images flash before his eyes. This experience apparently destroys O'Brien's sanity. Afterwards, Howard inquires about the church's parish records. Coot says he can arrange to have Howard look at them.Later, a man arrives at the home of locals Dennis and Jenny. He discovers a clearly traumatized Jenny. Police arrive. Rawhead drags Dennis's dead body through the forest and comes upon a trailer park. A teenager named Andy Johnson is trying to make out with his girlfriend. The two teens head into the woods. Soon after, Howard sees Rawhead on top of a distant hill with Andy's head in his hand.Afterwards, Howard speaks again with Coot, who tells him the church's parish records have been stolen. Declan O'Brien destroys his camera. He takes his family on the road again.On the road, Howard's daughter needs to go to the bathroom, so Howard pulls over and lets her go by a tree. Hearing her suddenly scream, Howard and his wife rush to her; Howard's son stays in the van, alone. Rawhead kills Howard's son and takes the body into the woods. Infuriated by the police's unsuccessful efforts to track down Rawhead, Howard returns to the church. He discovers that there is a weapon shown in the stained glass window that can be used to defeat the monster. After Howard leaves, Coot curiously touches the altar but resists the temptations and images it shows him.Rawhead arrives at the church to baptize O'Brien by urinating on him. A bewildered Coot goes outside to investigate the noise and sees Rawhead. Horrified, Coot flees inside the church and into the basement while Rawhead destroys everything inside. Coot finds the missing parish records, showing what appears to be some kind of blueprint of Rawhead himself. The insane O'Brien catches Coot and forces him upstairs to be sacrificed to Rawhead. The police arrive at the church and prepare to open fire on Rawhead, but they hesitate because he is carrying Coot. The brainwashed inspector dumps gasoline around the police cars and ignites it just as they begin to shoot at Rawhead, killing all the police, including himself.Howard leaves his wife and daughter and goes back to the church where a dying Coot tells him that Rawhead is afraid of something in the altar. Howard goes inside where O'Brian is burning books and is overpowered by Howard. Howard, by using a candle stick, opens the altar and gets to the weapon. O'Brian retreats to Rawhead to tell him, leaving Rawhead displeased. Howard tries to use the weapon, but has no effect. In anger, Rawhead kills O'Brian by tearing out his throat, with Howard's wife watching in terror.As Rawhead tries to kill Howard, his wife picks up the weapon, it activates, stopping Rawhead from killing Howard. A ray of light comes out of the weapon and hits Rawhead, hurting him. Howard realizes that it has to be a woman for it to work. Then the form of a woman appears from the stone and shoots electric rays through the stones and into Rawhead's body, knocking him to the ground. After a few more blasts, Rawhead is drained and weakened to the point where he has no hair, has aged, and is ill and dying. Finally he falls through the ground with Howard's wife dropping the weapon in with him. Rawhead is smashed under giant stones and finished. Both Howard and his wife cry in light of it being over.In the end, the boy from the trailer park places flowers on Andy Johnson's grave. As he walks away, Rawhead emerges from the ground and roars.[A]: Who touched the altar?[Q]: Wounded and on the run, notorious gunman Quirt Evans (John Wayne) gallops onto a farm owned by Quaker Thomas Worth (John Halloran) and his family and collapses. When Quirt urgently insists upon sending a telegram, Thomas and his daughter Penelope (Gail Russell) drive him into town in their wagon. After wiring a claim to the land recorder's office, Quirt kisses Penny and then passes out. Ignoring the doctor's advice to rid themselves of the gunman, the compassionate Worth family tends to the delirious Quirt, and Penny becomes intrigued by his ravings of past loves.Days later, when Quirt regains consciousness, Penny patiently explains the family's belief in non-violence. Three weeks later, Laredo Stevens (Bruce Cabot) and Hondo Jeffries (Louis Faust) ride into town looking for Quirt. When Penny's younger brother Johnny (Stephen Grant) rushes home to inform Quirt of his visitors, Quirt quickly prepares to flee. Penny, now smitten with Quirt, offers to run off with him. At the sound of approaching horses, Quirt grabs his gun and discovers that it has been emptied. Training his gun on the doorway, Quirt calmly greets Hondo and Laredo. Thinking that Quirt has the upper hand, Laredo offers to buy his claim. When Quirt sets the price at 20,000, Laredo hands over 5,000 in gold and challenges him to come for the balance when he is able â if he has the nerve.Play mediaAngel and the BadmanAfterward, Quirt saddles his horse, but when Penny begs him to stay, he changes his mind. Later, Quirt learns that cantankerous rancher Frederick Carson (Paul Hurst) has dammed up the stream that runs through the valley, thus draining the Worths' irrigation ditches. Quirt intimidates Carson into opening the dam.One Sunday, Penny asks Quirt to join the family for a ride. Before they leave, Marshal Wistful McClintock (Harry Carey) comes to question Quirt about a stagecoach robbery. The family swears that Quirt was with them at the time. The marshal then asks Quirt why he resigned as Wyatt Earp's deputy, sold his ranch and crossed over to the wrong side of the law soon after cattleman Walt Ennis was gunned down in a saloon brawl. When Quirt refuses to answer, the marshal leaves. Penny then begs Quirt to steer clear of Laredo, and he acquiesces because of his love for her.As Quirt and the Worths ride to the Quaker gathering, Quirt's erstwhile sidekick, Randy McCall (Lee Dixon), tags along. Randy tells Quirt that Laredo plans to rustle a herd of cattle and suggests that they then steal the herd from Laredo and let him take the blame. Mr. Worth gives Quirt a Bible for ending the feud with Carson. Fearing that he will never be able to live up to Penny's expectations, Quirt abruptly leaves with Randy.Quirt recovering under the care of the two women (from left to right: Rich, Russell, and Wayne)Quirt and Randy steal the herd from the original rustlers. They then celebrate with showgirls Lila Neal (Joan Barton) and Christine Taylor (Rosemary Bertrand). When Lila, sensing a change in her old flame, teases Quirt about his Bible, Quirt becomes angry and rides back to the Worth farm. Overjoyed, Penny throws her arms around him, just as the marshal arrives to question Quirt about the rustling. Quirt states that Lila can provide him with an alibi. Penny is hurt that Quirt was with his old flame, who she heard him talk about in his delirium, thinking Quirt prefers Lila's fair hair. Quirt realizes the depth of his feelings for Penny, and they kiss hungrily in the barn, while the camera fades.The marshal warns Quirt that he is the wrong man for Penny. Quirt decides to propose to her anyway. Instead of replying, Penny invites Quirt to join her picking blackberries. Quirt answers Penny's questions about his early life. Kindly Walt Ennis raised him after his parents were massacred by Indians. Then Ennis was murdered.Quirt and Penny are ambushed and chased by Laredo and Hondo on their way home. Their wagon plunges over a cliff into the river, causing Penny to develop a dangerous fever. When the doctor informs Quirt that there is no hope for her, Quirt straps on his pistol and rides into town to exact revenge. After Quirt leaves, Penny's fever suddenly breaks.In town, Quirt sends Bradley to tell Laredo and Hondo he is waiting for them in the street. Penny and her family arrive. She gets Quirt to surrender his gun to her. As Laredo and Hondo draw their guns, Marshal McClintock shoots them both. Quirt rides off in the wagon with Penny. The marshal picks up Quirt's discarded weapon.

That's about all the compliment this machine can be given.Problems:The \\"attached\\" lid makes cleaning the carafe an awkward affair. It is ostensibly detachable, but the hinge feels far too flimsy to survive multiple removals.The \\"auto stop\\" plunger on the filter holder barely works. I've spilled many cups of coffee when removing the carafe before brewing is complete.By default, the device beeps whenever brewing is complete. Make it stop.The whole apparatus for inserting/removing the charcoal filter is flimsy. I broke it during initial setup of the machine -- and I was being as gentle as humanly possible.Save your money.

Imagine watching a short film that starts over again and again, each time from the life of a different character. Each version builds on the other. The pieces fall into place, but not completely til the very end. The story lines are well developed and run in parallel until you find yourself surprised when you see how they meet.The cast is very balanced; no one stands out as the main character. The big names: Patrick Swayze, Hilary Swank, Rachel Leigh Cook, all fit in just like the lesser-knowns and their acting makes them very believable.

Apparently the film masters for each section have aged differently. The result is that you can see color balance differences in each section of the screen. For example, the left and right may look OK while the center appears faded. The 3 areas of the screen are quite distinct from each other (especially in bright outdoor scenes). For me, it was somewhat like viewing the movie through a kaleidoscope and I found it distracting.

Additionally, you're given one answer which is one of the objects present in the question. In this task, you need to minimally change the given question so that the answer flips to another object in the question. Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"small\\" to \\"big\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank. The two objects should be used ONCE in your question.

Some people even think they are fun. Many seem unable to get through an e-mail or Instant Message chat sentence without using one. Some feel that they add feeling and character to otherwise cold digital communications. Some people, such as a Hollywood scriptwriter John Blumenthal, however, _ the use of emoticons as \\"infantile just like the people who use them\\". He believes that words themselves should be enough. \\"If you're funny, happy or sad, that should be apparent from the comment that goes before the emoticons,\\" he argues. In the eyes of Blumenthal, the use of emoticons is a gender issue. \\"Men don't use emoticons very much. Maybe not at all,\\" he said, \\"Teenage girls and women seem to use them a lot. Maybe there's an emoticon gene.\\" It's an interesting opinion, but it is not shared by all. In an interview with The New York Times, Dacher Keltner, professor of psychology at the University of California, said that emoticons are popular because our brains are programmed \\"to seek out representations of humanity\\". He believes that they are popular not because they are shortcuts for the lazy, but because they bring in something beyond language. They satisfy our needs to be with and communicate with people. All of these arguments may be somehow right. Each one of us will choose to communicate in our own way. I tried to use one once and felt like I was stealing into a primary school class that I had no place being in. I'd rather let my words do the talking.

Until just a few days before, she had been with her mother, walking through the sweeping grasslands of Tsavo National Park in the African country of Kenya. The baby's mother was killed, most likely by a poacher. On Wednesday, November 17,2010, an anti-poaching team was removing the deadly wire traps that poachers set throughout the park. Luckily, a member of the team spotted the baby and rushed to help her. Suddenly, a lion sprang from the bushes and clamped its mouth around her neck. One person managed to pull out his gun and fire shots in the air. The shocked lion released the baby and backed away. Now the weakened baby had a grave wound on her neck. About 300 miles north of Tsavo is a place that helps baby elephants. Over the years, the orphanage has raised 130 elephants and successfully released them back into the wild. After a tense wait and a plane ride, the baby's rescuers made it to the orphanage. The medical staff worked frantically to treat her wound. She was scared and wild. She screamed, and wouldn't let any humans get near her, refusing to eat or drink. After two hours of intense medical care, Ishanga awoke and slowly struggled to her feet. Two keepers and a veterinarian had been with her all night. They were relieved that she seemed to be recovering. The next day, though Ishanga remained weak, her keepers introduced her to some of the other 14 young elephants living at the orphanage. The keepers stood back as the other elephants extended their trunk in friendly greetings. The older elephants led Ishanga around, giving her a tour of her new home. Over the past year, Ishanga's wounds have healed. She has made many friends. It'll be up to Ishanga to decide when she's ready to leave the orphanage. Returning to the wild is a long process that can take more than 10 years. For now, she is in no rush to leave this extraordinary community of elephants and humans. Ishanga has a long, happy life ahead of her.

How much money did Anna have left?A: Anna bought 3 packs of chewing gum that were 1 each for a total of 3 * 1 = 3. Anna bought 5 chocolate bars that were 1 each for a total of 5 * 1 = 5. Anna bought 2 large candy canes that were .50 each for a total of 2 * .50 = 1. The total amount spent was 3 + 5 + 1 = 9.00. Anna had 10 to start and spent 9.00 so she had 10 - 9.00 = 1.00 left. The answer is 1.Question: Steve wanted to make a total of 100 within four days, so he took on a berry-picking job in Sweden. The job paid 2 for every pound of lingonberries picked. On Monday he picked 8 pounds. Tuesday’s harvest was triple what he had picked the previous day. On Wednesday he felt very tired and decided to rest. How many pounds of lingonberries did Steve have to pick on Thursday?Answer: On Monday, Steve was paid 8 * 2 = 16 dollars. Tuesday’s harvest was 3 * 8 = 24 pounds. The 24 pounds Steve picked on Tuesday gave him 24 * 2 = 48 dollars. So, the amount Steve earned from the first two days on the job is 16 + 48 = 64 dollars. Since Steve rested on Wednesday, he made 0 dollars, meaning his earnings were 64 + 0 = 64 dollars. The difference between Steve’s earnings and his target is 100 - 64 = 36 dollars. Since he was paid 2 dollars for each pound of lingonberries, Steve needed to pick 36 / 2 = 18 pounds. The answer is 18.Q: Two friends, Hubert and Ian, are planning to have a pizza party. One box of pizza is worth 14, and a can of soda is worth 1.80. Hubert orders eight boxes of pizza and ten cans of soda. Ian buys ten boxes of pizza and fifteen cans of soda. How much do they spend in all?A:","answer":"The number of boxes of pizza is 8 + 10 = 18 boxes. The number of cans of soda is 10 + 15 = 25 cans. The eighteen boxes of pizza cost 18 x 14 = 252. The cost of 25 cans of soda is 25 x 1.80 = 45. Therefore, the total amount they spend is 252 + 45 = 297. The answer is 297."},{"question":"Q: In this task, You are given an amazon food product review and its summary.

Brian bought half of the animals and sold them at the market. Jeremy then gifted Fred an additional 37 goats. If exactly half of the animals in the barn are male animals, how many male animals are there in the barn?[Answer]Fred's barn started with 100 + 29 + 9 = 138 animals. Brian bought half of these, so there were 138 / 2 = 69 remaining. After Jeremy gifted Fred 37 goats, there were 69 + 37 = 106 animals in the barn. So, 106 / 2 = 53 of these animals are male.

Her shopping trip took an hour and a half. How many minutes did Josie spend shopping instead of waiting?A: There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the trip took 1 1 / 2 * 60 = 90 minutes. Josie spent 3 + 13 + 14 + 18 = 48 minutes waiting. Thus, she spent 90 - 48 = 42 minutes shopping. The answer is 42.Question: Cheryl got angry with her sister and decided to run away from home.

He watches a 4-minute video of cats. He then watches a video twice as long as the cat video involving dogs. He finishes up his video watching for the day by watching a video on gorillas that's twice as long as the previous two videos combined. How many minutes does Brian spend watching animal videos?[Answer]Brian begins by watching a 4 - minute video, and since the second video is twice as long that means the second video is 4 * 2 = 8 minutes. The first two videos combined therefore for a 4 + 8 = 12 minute run time. Since the third video is twice as long as the first two videos put together, that means it is 12 * 2 = 24 minutes in length. The total length of time spent is therefore 24 + 12 = 36 minutes. The answer is 36.Q: Viviana has five more chocolate chips than Susana, while Susana has 3/4 as many vanilla chips as Viviana.

Review title: Broken for the 3rd time Product review: I purchased this wine cooler which lasted roughly one year and ceased to cool.I opened it and found problems with the power supplies (both) which I repaired as I am skilled in that area, still no cooling.Replaced both thermoelectric coolers (TEC1-12705) and all 4 fans (two external and two internal fans as they were getting noisy) and it cooled for almost 3 months before one of the thermoelectric coolers failed and blew another fuse in the power supply.Short end of it... Thermoelectric (Peltier Effect) coolers are great when they work but they tend to gradually decrease in performance as condensation causes corrosion between the junctions that ends up resulting in a short which blows the fuse in the power supply.This unit isn't very well made and as you can tell from MANY MANY negative reviews will sadly fail despite it's great looks.I may repair mine once more and then switch to a compressor model because I don't have the time or patience to repair it every few months.AnswerdecreaseYou are considering whether to buy a product.

They would send no more expeditions to restore order. The emperor apparently had no interest in committing troops that would be required to pacify the fragmented country. Indeed, his real aim all along may have been \\"to keep the entire region of Southeast Asia broken and fragmented.\\" It would be another two years until one of Narathihapate's sons, Kyawswa, emerged as king of Pagan in May 1289. But the new \\"king\\" controlled just a small area around the capital, and had no real army. The real power in central Burma now rested with the three commander brothers. The uneasy arrangement would persist until 1297. The Mongols continued to occupy northern Burma to Tagaung as the province of Zhengmian  but ended the fictional central Burma province of Mianzhong on 18 August 1290. Meanwhile, the power struggle in central Burma continued with the three brothers blatantly consolidating support. To check their rising power, Kyawswa submitted to the Mongols in January 1297, and was recognized by the Yuan emperor Temür Khan as King of Pagan on 20 March 1297. The emperor also gave Chinese titles to the brothers as subordinates of Kyawswa. The brothers resented the new arrangement as it directly reduced their power. On 17 December 1297, the three brothers overthrew Kyawswa, and founded the Myinsaing Kingdom. The dethronement forced the Mongol government to intervene again, leading to the second Mongol invasion of Burma . The invasion failed. Two years later, on 4 April 1303, the Mongols abolished the province of Zhengmian , evacuated Tagaung, and returned to Yunnan. Question: How many years after Kyawswa emerged as king did he submit to the Mongols? Answer type: Number ","answer":"8."},{"question":"Teacher: You are given a conversation between two people.

Each notebook cost 4.00 meanwhile each pen cost 1.50. How much money will be left from Rubble after the purchase?Answer: The total cost of two notebooks is 4.00 x 2 = 8.00. The total cost of two pen 1.50 x 2 = 3.00. So, the total amount Rubble spent for all the stuff was 8.00 + 3.00 = 11.00. Therefore, Rubble was left off with 15.00 - 11.00 = 4.00.

All other modules cost 100 per square foot. If Denny plans to build a 2,000 square foot modular home containing one kitchen and two bathrooms, how much will it cost, in dollars?Answer: The kitchen and two bathroom modules will take up 400 + 150 + 150 = 700 sq. ft. of the 2000 sq. ft. of space. Thus, the remaining modular space is 2000 - 700 = 1300 sq. ft. Cost of the kitchens and bathrooms is 20,000 + 12,000 + 12,000 = 44,000. The cost of the other 1300 sq. ft. of space is 1300 * 100 = 130,000. In total, the cost of the complete 2000 sq.ft. modular home with one kitchen and two bathrooms is 44,000 + 130,000 = 174,000.

An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.Input: What is the average number of gold medals for clubs?Output:","answer":"SELECT avg(Gold) FROM club_rank"},{"question":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a list of integers.

They put the border together first and that was 75 pieces. Trevor was able to place 105 pieces of the puzzle. Joe was able to place three times the number of puzzle pieces as Trevor. How many puzzle pieces are missing?[Answer]The puzzle is 500 pieces and the border used 75 pieces so 500 - 75 = 425 pieces left. Joe placed three times as many puzzle pieces as Trevor who placed 105 so Joe placed 3 * 105 = 315 piece. Together Joe and Trevor placed 315 + 105 pieces for a total of 420 pieces. With the border down that left 425 pieces left and they put down 420 pieces so that meant 425 - 420 = 5 pieces were missing. The answer is 5.Q: Mario has 3 hibiscus plants in his garden.

One day, Pip runs into an escaped convict, Abel Magwitch (Finlay Currie), who intimidates the boy into getting him some food and a file for his chains. Magwitch is caught when he attacks a hated fellow escapee, and is taken back to the prison ship.Miss Havisham (Martita Hunt), an eccentric rich spinster, arranges to have Pip come to her mansion regularly to provide her with company and to play with her adopted daughter, a cruel but beautiful teenage girl, Estella (Jean Simmons). Estella mocks Pip's coarse manners at every opportunity, but Pip quickly falls in love with her. The visits come to an end when Pip turns 14 and begins his apprenticeship as a blacksmith. Estella also leaves, for France, to learn to become a lady.Six years later Miss Havisham's lawyer, Mr. Jaggers (Francis L. Sullivan), visits Pip (played as adult by John Mills) to tell him that a mysterious benefactor has offered to transform him into a gentleman, one with \\"great expectations\\"; Pip assumes it is Miss Havisham. He is taken to London, where Mr. Jaggers arranges for Pip to stay with Herbert Pocket (played as an adult by Alec Guinness), who will teach him how to behave like a gentleman. From Herbert, Pip learns that Miss Havisham was left at the altar many years ago; she is determined to avenge herself against all men, and Estella is her instrument to break men's hearts.After Pip turns 21, Joe Gargery comes to visit him, bringing a request from Miss Havisham to visit her. There he is delighted to be reunited with Estella (played as an adult by Valerie Hobson), who tells him, \\"You must know, Pip, I have no heart.\\" Estella and Pip spend much time together. She confesses to Pip that despite flirting with the wealthy but unpopular Bentley Drummle, she has absolutely no feelings for him. Pip suddenly receives another visitor from the past, Magwitch, who reveals that he is Pip's patron. Pip, who always imagined that Miss Havisham was responsible for his good fortune, now realises that she was only using him. Growing suspicious of Drummle's overtures toward Estella, Pip visits Estella at the old woman's house, where she tells him that she is going to marry Drummle. Pip confronts Miss Havisham, saying \\"I am as unhappy as you could have ever meant me to be.\\" Miss Havisham, finally realising what she has done, begs his forgiveness. Pip leaves, but when she stands up to follow him, a piece of flaming wood from the fireplace rolls out and ignites Miss Havisham's dress. Her screams alert Pip, who runs back to save her, but fails.After being warned that an old enemy (the other escapee at the beginning of the film) knows that Magwitch is in London, Pip makes preparations to smuggle the old man onto a packet boat and accompany him to the continent. Pip, Herbert and Magwitch row out to the packet boat, but are intercepted by the waiting police, tipped off by Magwitch's great enemy. Magwitch is seriously injured in a struggle with his nemesis, who dies when caught in the packet's paddlewheels. He had spoken to Pip of his lost daughter, and Pip's suspicion that she is Estella is confirmed by Mr. Jaggers. Pip visits the dying Magwitch and tells him of her fate, and that he, Pip, is in love with her; Magwitch passes away, a contented man. Stricken by illness and with his expectations gone, Pip is taken home and nursed back to health by Joe Gargery. He revisits Miss Havisham's deserted house, where he finds Estella. Her plans for the future have also gone awry, as Drummle had broken off their engagement after Mr. Jaggers informed him of her true parentage. Learning that Estella plans to live in seclusion in the house, which she has inherited, Pip proceeds to tear down the curtains and force open the boarded-up windows; for the first time in years sunlight illuminates the room, revealing cobwebs, dust, and decay. Pip tells Estella that he has never stopped loving her. After hesitating, she embraces him and they leave the house together., Question: Who has never stopped loving Estella?A: ","answer":"Answer: Pip"},{"question":"Many scientific studies using Botox have been conducted to reduce fine lines and wrinkles to diminish the signs of ageing.\\"Products such as botox and fillers have become increasingly popular as they can diminish signs of Ageing.\\"Is the above claim true?Options:- yes- noyesThe hovercraft is famous as a vehicle that is capable of both water and land travel.Is the following statement true?\\"A Hovercraft can travel on both land and water.\\"yesThis is a quick overview of the Orange Revolution, a series of riots after a presidential election in Ukraine.Is the following statement true?\\"Claims of corruption and voter intimidation sparked the Orange Revolution in Ukraine.\\"yesInterior design involves arrangement of things in orderly and subtlely pleasant ways.","answer":"Is the following a factual statement?\\"People who practice Interior design have an eye for detail.\\"Options:- yes- noyes"},{"question":"Gina and Tom were playing football.

Follow the example to solve a new instance of the task.Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation. Imagine that the given text is a social media post, and you have to write the title of the post, so the users can decide to read the main text or not.My boyfriend (well just call him M) and I are creators on Instagram (he is also on TikTok). I'm a digital and traditional artist and in one of my classes we create t shirts and things (socks, lanyards, water bottles, stickers, you name it). I'm a big fan of putting my art on t shirts so I can sell them.M wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet. M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying \\"of course you dont know, because you never look.\\"Am I the asshole for wanting to wear the shirt I made just once?Solution: wanting to wear a shirtWhy? The paragraph describes an argument of the author with her boyfriend regarding not wanting to give the shirt she just made before wearing herself. This desire to wear the shirt raises the ethical situation.New input: Should say, not intentionally. My family talks shit a lot but I’m on the gentler side of shit talking. None of my nephews or nieces really have a mother figure, and I just grew up being that for them. It doesn’t feel right to talk shit back, ya feel?But anyway, one of my nephews is going through a rebellious phase where he hates his dad, and me. But it’s a bit difficult for me to handle because as much as I try to fill the female role in his life, I’m not his bio mom. I’ve got no obligation to deal with him lashing out, and as a laid back (if grumpy) woman in my early 20s I don’t feel inclined to. Normally if he starts talking shit, I leave it up to his dad to deal with him, and just mentally check out. But he gets real cocky sometimes and I’ll tickle him or something equally childish until he apologizes. (I.e poking, wet willies, just kid shit that annoys tf out of him cause he’s “too mature”)Now, tonight he happened to be playing fortnite my little brother (18), my other nephew (12), and my little brothers school friend (17). My brother and other nephew were teasing this nephew, while I was zoning out and scrolling though Reddit, when all of a sudden my nephew starts talking shit to me for no damn reason. He compared me to an overweight character who has a romantic relationship with a cat in the abridged version of a certain 90s anime. I got irritated and knew he was just showing off for my brothers friend, so I dragged him onto their mattress in the living room and tickled tf out of him and said “ya coulda just left me out of it!!!”This is where my little brother and other nephew start teasing and saying “that’s what you get for always talking shit!!!” And all of a sudden my nephews laughing starts turning to crying and he just curls up and cries, presumably out of embarrassment. I didn’t know what to do to handle the situation, so I just got up and told the other two to leave him alone now, but I still feel like a douche.AITA? I really feel like the asshole.Solution:","answer":"making my nephew cry"},{"question":"Denny asked: Test for natural language inference.Premise: \\"An older man is looking at a display of fire.\\"Hypothesis: \\"The man is watching something burn.\\"Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?Options:- yes- no- it is not possible to tell.Le: OK, so how can I answer with some explanation?","answer":"The older man is watching something burn by looking at the fire.The answer: yes."},{"question":"Pick one category for the following text.

Each tomato plant yields 20 pieces of tomatoes. How many pieces of tomatoes can the farmer get from all his planted tomatoes?Let's think: The farmer planted a total of 30 x 10 = 300 tomato plants. Thus, the farmer can get 300 x 20 = 6000 pieces of tomatoes.. The answer is: 6000.Albert noticed a flock of geese flying together in a V formation in the sky overhead. One half of the geese broke off from the formation, flew toward the earth, and landed in some trees. Then, 4 geese flew up, out of the trees, and joined those already flying in the air to make a new V formation in the sky. If the final number of geese flying in the V formation was 12, how many geese were in the first formation Albert noticed in the sky?Let's think: If the final number of geese was 12, which included the 4 that joined from the trees, then before these 4 joined, there were 12 - 4 = 8 geese in the sky. Since these 8 geese represent the half of geese remaining, then the initial formation contained 8 * 2 = 16 geese.. The answer is: 16.Kim orders a 10 meal and a drink for 2.5. She gives a 20% tip. She pays with a 20 bill. How much does she get in change?Let's think: The dinner cost 10 + 2.5 = 12.5. The tip comes to 12.5 * .2 = 2.5. So the total cost is 12.5 + 2.5 = 15. That means she gets 20 - 15 = 5 in change.. The answer is: 5.Lyka wants to buy a smartphone worth 160 but she only has 40 at the moment.

Review: A book which attempts to cover four billion years in less than four hundred pages is going to have to be a survey aimed at the general reader. If you like serious scientific tomes which discourage humour and a bit of artistic license in written presentations-- this is not for you. Fortney's book is an engaging and enjoyable read that gives insight into the development of life on earth and the scientific field of paleontology. His gifts for constructing an accessible and often charming narrative, quoting poets and bards, noting geniuses and quacks, is a great tribute to English educational system-- which here has developed a devoted scientific mind, obviously entranced by his subject matter, who can express himself with elegance, comprehension, wit and some self deprecation, a refreshing attribute for a scientist.A: satisfiedQuestion: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.

One-fourth of the curlers are small pink ones. There are twice as many medium blue curlers as there are pink ones. The rest are large green curlers. How many large green curlers does Erin have in her hair?Answer: Step-by-step reasoning process: There are 16 curlers in all and ¼ of them are pink or 16 curlers / 4 = 4 pink curlers. There are twice as many blue curlers as there are pink ones, so there are 4 pink x 2 = 8 blue curlers. Together, there are 4 pink curlers + 8 blue curlers = 12 pink and blue curlers in Erin’s hair. The remaining curlers are green, so of the 16 total curlers – 12 pink and blue curlers = 4 green curlers are in Erin’s hair.So the answer is 4.Question: James decides to go to prom with Susan. He pays for everything. The tickets cost 100 each. Dinner is 120. He leaves a 30% tip. He also charters a limo for 6 hours that cost 80 per hour. How much did it all cost?Answer: Step-by-step reasoning process: He paid 100 * 2 = 200 for tickets. The tip for dinner was 120 * .3 = 36. So he paid 120 + 36 = 156 for dinner. The limo cost 80 * 6 = 480. In total he paid 200 + 156 + 480 = 836.So the answer is 836.Question: Kim spends 25,000 to open a store.

So it takes 25000 / 2500 = 10 months to make back the money.So the answer is 10.Question: Tracy has a charity book collection store from which she receives book donations from members of her town.

I thought the bins would be helpful but they are not. What is means is that there is no room for legs so your child can only sit on the short ends of the table when what my daughter really wants to do is spread out her crayons etc on the long end. If she puts too much weight on the short end of the table, the only place where she can sit becasue the bins are in the way, the table will tip because the rectangle shape sets it off balance.

There were 50 students from Know It All High School at the competition, 3/5 times as many students from Karen High as Know It All High School, and twice the combined number of students from the first two schools that came were from Novel Corona High School. Calculate the total number of students at the competition?A: If 50 students came from Know It All High School, then Karen High, which had 3 / 5 times as many students as Know It All High School, had 3 / 5 * 50 = 30 students at the fair. The total number of students from Know It All and Karen high schools is 50 + 30 = 80 students. If Novel Corona had twice the combined number of students from Know It All and Karen high schools, then it had 2 * 80 = 160 students at the competition. The total number of students at the competition is 80 + 160 = 240. The answer is 240.Question: Rocco stores his coins in piles of 10 coins each.

In Zeoland, Jed was fined 256 for speeding on a road with a posted speed limit of 50 mph. Jed was fined for traveling at what speed in miles per hour?[Answer]First find how much Jed was above the speed limit: 256 fine / 16 for each mile per hour over = 16 miles per hour over. Since the speed limit is 50 mph, this means Jed was driving 50 + 16 = 66 mph. The answer is 66.Q: Kathryn moved to a new city for the new job she had landed two weeks ago. Her rent was 1200, 1/2 of what she spent on food and travel expenses in a month. Luckily, she found a new friend Shelby, who moved in with her to share the rent. If her salary was 5000 per month, how much money remained after her expenses?A: If the rent is half what she spends on food and travel expenses, she spends 1200 * 2 = 2400 on food and travel costs. When her friend moved in and shared the rent costs with her, she started paying 1 / 2 * 1200 = 600 in rent costs. Her total monthly expenses is now 600 + 2400 = 3000. When she deducts her monthly expenses from her salary, she has 5000 - 3000 = 2000 remaining. The answer is 2000.Question: Carrie is trying to sneak some mashed turnips into her kids' mashed potatoes.

It is typically rendered graphically as a plot, and the data observed from each side of a spiral galaxy are generally asymmetric, so that data from each side are averaged to create the curve. A significant discrepancy exists between the experimental curves observed, and a curve derived from theory. The theory of dark matter was postulated to account for the variance.Answer this question: what is the rotation curve of a spiral galaxy?## answerTo answer the above question, the relevant sentence is: The rotation curve of a disc galaxy (also called a velocity curve) is a plot of the orbital speeds of visible stars or gas in that galaxy versus their radial distance from that galaxy's centre.So the answer must be a plot of the orbital speeds of visible stars or gas in that galaxy versus their radial distance from that galaxy 's centre## questionIn measurements of purely mechanical systems (involving units of length, mass, force, energy, pressure, and so on), the differences between CGS and SI are straightforward and rather trivial; the unit-conversion factors are all powers of 10 as 100 cm = 1 m and 1000 g = 1 kg. For example, the CGS unit of force is the dyne which is defined as 1 g ⋅ cm / s, so the SI unit of force, the newton (1 kg ⋅ m / s), is equal to 100,000 dynes.The unit of force in cgs unit is?## answerTo answer the question, consider the following: For example, the CGS unit of force is the dyne which is defined as 1 g ⋅ cm / s, so the SI unit of force, the newton (1 kg ⋅ m / s), is equal to 100,000 dynes.So the answer must be dyne## questionThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international organization headquartered in Washington, D.C., consisting of \\"189 countries working to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world.\\" Formed in 1945 at the Bretton Woods Conference primarily by the ideas of Harry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes, it came into formal existence in 1945 with 29 member countries and the goal of reconstructing the international payment system.

Five years after retirement, any player with 10 years of major league experience who passes a screening committee (which removes from consideration players of clearly lesser qualification) is eligible to be elected by BBWAA members with 10 years' membership or more who also have been actively covering MLB at any time in the 10 years preceding the election (the latter requirement was added for the 2016 election). From a final ballot typically including 25 -- 40 candidates, each writer may vote for up to 10 players; until the late 1950s, voters were advised to cast votes for the maximum 10 candidates. Any player named on 75 % or more of all ballots cast is elected. A player who is named on fewer than 5 % of ballots is dropped from future elections. In some instances, the screening committee had restored their names to later ballots, but in the mid-1990s, dropped players were made permanently ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration, even by the Veterans Committee. A 2001 change in the election procedures restored the eligibility of these dropped players; while their names will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, they may be considered by the Veterans Committee. Players receiving 5 % or more of the votes but fewer than 75 % are reconsidered annually until a maximum of ten years of eligibility (lowered from fifteen years for the 2015 election).Based on this passage, how long do you have to wait to be inducted into the mlb hall of fame?## answer","answer":"To answer the question, consider the following: Five years after retirement, any player with 10 years of major league experience who passes a screening committee (which removes from consideration players of clearly lesser qualification) is eligible to be elected by BBWAA members with 10 years' membership or more who also have been actively covering MLB at any time in the 10 years preceding the election (the latter requirement was added for the 2016 election).So the answer must be Five years after retirement"},{"question":"Person A: I you believe in god, where will you go when you die?Options:- heaven- church- imagination- synagogue- monasteryPerson B: Let me think.
