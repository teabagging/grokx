We have investigated the effects of Vpr on host cell activation and confirm that it influences cellular proliferation. However, we have also found that Vpr modulates T-cell receptor (TCR) -triggered apoptosis in a manner similar to that of glucocorticoids. In the absence of TCR-mediated activation, Vpr induces apoptosis whereas in its presence, Vpr interrupts the expected induction of apoptosis. This regulation of apoptosis is linked to Vpr suppression of NF-kappa B activity via the induction of I kappa B, an inhibitor of NF-kappa B. Further, Vpr suppresses expression of IL-2, IL-10, IL-12, TNF alpha and IL-4, all of which are NF-kappa B-dependent. The effects of Vpr could be reversed by RU486. Our finding that Vpr can regulate NF-kappa B supports the hypothesis that some aspects of viral pathogenesis are the consequence of cell dysregulation by Vpr.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"IL - 12\\", \\"HIV - 1 Vpr\\", \\"IL - 4\\", \\"HIV - 1 accessory gene product\\", \\"The HIV - 1 accessory gene product Vpr\\", \\"IL - 10\\", \\"nuclear factor kappa B\\", \\"Vpr\\", \\"NF - kappa B\\", \\"TCR\\", \\"IL - 2\\", \\"TNF alpha\\", \\"I kappa B\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Ghrelin is an orexigenic hormone produced by the stomach in direct proportion to the time since the last meal and has therefore been called a 'hunger signal'. The octanoylation of ghrelin is critical for its orexigenic functions and is dependent upon ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) catalyzation. The GOAT inhibitor, GO-CoA-Tat, decreases the circulating concentrations of octanoylated ghrelin and attenuates weight gain on a high fat diet in mice. Unlike rats and mice, Siberian hamsters and humans do not increase food intake after food deprivation, but increase food hoarding after food deprivation. In Siberian hamsters, exogenous ghrelin increases ingestive behaviors similarly to 48-56h food deprivation. Therefore, we tested the necessity of increased ghrelin in food-deprived Siberian hamsters to stimulate ingestive behaviors. To do so we used our simulated natural housing system that allows hamsters to forage for and hoard food. Animals were given an injection of GO-CoA-Tat (i.p., 11μmol/kg) every 6h because that is the duration of its effective inhibition of octanoylated ghrelin concentrations during a 48h food deprivation. We found that GO-CoA-Tat attenuated food foraging (0-1h), food intake (0-1 and 2-4h), and food hoarding (0-1h and 2 and 3days) post-refeeding compared with saline treated animals. This suggests that increased octanoylated ghrelin concentrations play a role in the food deprivation-induced increases in ingestive behavior. Therefore, ghrelin is a critical aspect of the multi-faceted mechanisms that stimulate ingestive behaviors, and might be a critical point for a successful clinical intervention scheme in humans.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"O\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Oxidizing agents are powerful activators of factors responsible for the transcriptional activation of cytokine-encoding genes involved in tissue injury. In this study we show evidence that STAT3 is a transcription factor whose activity is modulated by H2O2 in human lymphocytes, in which endogenous catalase had previously been inhibited. H2O2-induced nuclear translocation of STAT3 to form sequence-specific DNA-bound complexes was evidenced by immunoblotting of nuclear fractions and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and vanadate was found to strongly synergize with H2O2. Moreover, anti-STAT3 antibodies specifically precipitated a protein of 92 kDa that becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine upon lymphocyte treatment with H2O2. Phenylarsine oxide, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, and genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, cooperated and cancelled, respectively, the H2O2-promoted STAT3 nuclear translocation. Evidence is also presented, using Fe2 + / Cu2 + ions, that. OH generated from H2O2 through Fenton reactions could be a candidate oxygen reactive species to directly activate STAT3. Present data suggest that H2O2 and vanadate are likely to inhibit the activity of intracellular tyrosine phosphatase (s), leading to enhanced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and hence its translocation to the nucleus. These results demonstrate that the DNA binding activity of STAT3 can be modulated by oxidizing agents and provide a framework to understand the effects of oxidative stress on the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"human lymphocytes\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"cytokine - encoding genes\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"transcription factor\\", \\"JAK\\", \\"STAT3\\", \\"STAT3 antibodies\\", \\"intracellular tyrosine phosphatase\\", \\"catalase\\", \\"sequence - specific DNA - bound complexes\\", \\"92 kDa\\", \\"- STAT\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

We investigated how the structural properties of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) correlate with structural changes of phosphatidylcholine plus sphingomyelin (2.4:1) model lipid membranes. Changes were measured by fluorescence anisotropy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and differential scanning calorimetry. Two fluorophores and two spin probes were used to monitor membrane characteristics close to water-lipid interface and in the middle of the bilayer. The data obtained were correlated to the amount of bounded compounds, the number of H-bonds, and the topological polar surface area (TPSA) of the compounds. These correlations reflect the behaviours of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, EGC, EGCG and BHT.

The selective norepinephrine (NE) transporter inhibitor atomoxetine (formerly called tomoxetine or LY139603) has been shown to alleviate symptoms in Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). We investigated the mechanism of action of atomoxetine in ADHD by evaluating the interaction of atomoxetine with monoamine transporters, the effects on extracellular levels of monoamines, and the expression of the neuronal activity marker Fos in brain regions. Atomoxetine inhibited binding of radioligands to clonal cell lines transfected with human NE, serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) transporters with dissociation constants (K (i)) values of 5, 77 and 1451 nM, respectively, demonstrating selectivity for NE transporters. In microdialysis studies, atomoxetine increased extracellular (EX) levels of NE in prefrontal cortex (PFC) 3-fold, but did not alter 5-HT (EX) levels. Atomoxetine also increased DA (EX) concentrations in PFC 3-fold, but did not alter DA (EX) in striatum or nucleus accumbens. In contrast, the psychostimulant methylphenidate, which is used in ADHD therapy, increased NE (EX) and DA (EX) equally in PFC, but also increased DA (EX) in the striatum and nucleus accumbens to the same level. The expression of the neuronal activity marker Fos was increased 3.7-fold in PFC by atomoxetine administration, but was not increased in the striatum or nucleus accumbens, consistent with the regional distribution of increased DA (EX). We hypothesize that the atomoxetine-induced increase of catecholamines in PFC, a region involved in attention and memory, mediates the therapeutic effects of atomoxetine in ADHD. In contrast to methylphenidate, atomoxetine did not increase DA in striatum or nucleus accumbens, suggesting it would not have motoric or drug abuse liabilities.","answer":"[[\\"atomoxetine\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"norepinephrine (NE) transporter\\"], [\\"LY139603\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"norepinephrine (NE) transporter\\"], [\\"atomoxetine\\", \\"INDIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"Fos\\"], [\\"atomoxetine\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"monoamine transporters\\"], [\\"Atomoxetine\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"NE transporters\\"], [\\"tomoxetine\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"norepinephrine (NE) transporter\\"]]"},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

1999) .Research for navigation has recently seen a rejuvenation due to the advent of learning-based approaches Parisotto & Salakhutdinov, 2017; Henriques & Vedaldi, 2018) .Embodied learning-based approaches have shown some appealing properties over classical approaches such as being able to operate in complex environments with limited sensor data (Savva et al., 2019; Mishkin et al., 2019) .However, there is a need for the ability to plan across long time horizons with sparse reward signals.This in effect, causes limitations such as the inability to overcome small obstacles when navigating towards a given goal and the requirement of invoking the environment a large number of times for any meaningful learning to occur (Le et al., 2018) .Works which have combined hierarchical reinforcement learning with imitation learning have shown promising results (Das et al., 2018b; Le et al., 2018) , by leveraging expert trajectories with policy sketches (Andreas et al., 2017) , which are less expensive to obtain; however these sketches still require annotation of the environment.In this work, we study such hierarchical control for the task of indoor navigation, whereby an embodied agent is randomly spawned within a novel and complex environment and must learn to navigate this environment through interaction (Das et al., 2018a) .We address this challenging learning problem through a hierarchical policy approach, where two agents are cooperatively trained together.Each agent performs a different role, where one agent acts as a Planner, learning how to propose good sub-goals to an Executor agent, which acts at the low level to achieve these sub-goals (Fig. 1) .In contrast to existing hierarchical policy learning approaches, communication between our two agents is two-way, where the Executor provides the Planner with a summary of its series of actions and recent observations.This aids the Planner in deciding the next sub-goal with additional side Figure 1 : Our PLEX framework adopts a hierarchical policy approach, where a Planner proposes sub-goals for an Executor to act upon within an environment.The Planner receives an egocentric, top-down view with the target location and an embedding summary provided by the Executor.The Executor receives visual sensory data (i.e. colour and depth) as its input and a sub-goal provided by the Planner.Our method reduces the need for long-term planning and addresses the known sample inefficiency problem accompanying memory models within deep reinforcement learning approaches.information provided by the Executor.To this end, we propose PLEX, a planning and executing learning framework which offers the following contributions:• A hierarchical reinforcement learning approach where two agents specialise on different tasks but are jointly trained by sharing information • We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that our method benefits from significantly improved sample efficiency as the time horizon is distributed between the Planner and Executor • By extension, our approach mitigates problems prevalent in long-horizon planning, especially those adopting LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) planning approachesIn this work, we present a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach for solving PointGoal navigation tasks.Our proposed approach uses a cooperative learning strategy in which two agents, an Executor and a Planner are jointly learned to solve this task.This is enabled through a two-way communication channel established between the two agents through the use of an Executor Latent Information vector provided by the Executor and sub-goals generated by the Planner.We motivate the use of this hierarchical approach both theoretically, as well as through empirical experiments which demonstrate a significant improvement in sampling efficiency of our approach, allowing our structured approach to perform significantly better on increasingly harder tasks when compared to baseline approaches.","answer":"We present a hierarchical learning framework for navigation within an embodied learning setting"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

SARS pathology is propagated both by direct cytotoxic effects of the virus and aberrant activation of the innate immune response.Here, we identify several mechanisms by which a SARS-CoV open reading frame (ORF) activates intracellular stress pathways and targets the innate immune response.We show that ORF8b forms insoluble intracellular aggregates dependent on a valine at residue 77.Aggregated ORF8b induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, lysosomal damage, and subsequent activation of the master regulator of the autophagy and lysosome machinery, Transcription factor EB (TFEB).ORF8b causes cell death in epithelial cells, which is partially rescued by reducing its ability to aggregate.In macrophages, ORF8b robustly activates the NLRP3 inflammasome by providing a potent signal 2 required for activation.Mechanistically, ORF8b interacts directly with the Leucine Rich Repeat domain of NLRP3 and localizes with NLRP3 and ASC in cytosolic dot-like structures.ORF8b triggers cell death consistent with pyroptotic cell death in macrophages.While in those cells lacking NLRP3 accumulating ORF8b cytosolic aggregates cause ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and caspase-independent cell death.","answer":"{\\"verdict\\": \\"SUPPORT\\", \\"evidence\\": [\\"Here, we identify several mechanisms by which a SARS-CoV open reading frame (ORF) activates intracellular stress pathways and targets the innate immune response.\\"]}"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2016 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

It utilised a cascade of ANNs to forecast personality traits from static face images to examine the connections between signals from stationary facial expression cues and self-reported personality traits. The finding provides strong evidence that multidimensional personality profiles can be predicted using ANNs trained on substantial labelled datasets from static facial photos. According to the study, advanced computer vision algorithms can be used to realise personality traits in real-world photos obtained in unexpected situations. shows unequivocally that each of the Big Five features is connected to a collection of face clues that can be gathered by using machine learning methods.

The paper also explored that the most specific attributes for unimodal personality detection come from the visual modality. Combining inputs from multiple modalities frequently increases prediction accuracy. The accuracy was found to significantly increase when common sense knowledge and psycho-linguistic features were combined. This investigation only considered computational methods and excludes psychological studies on personality detection because it encompasses such a broad and varied topic as personality detection. end-to-end AI conducting interviews system. The above system performs automatic personality recognition based on features extracted from the AVIs and the genuine personality scores from the respondents' self-reported survey questions and facial gestures.

METHODS: All ward patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were investigated. After determining the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the study population was identified. The urine dipstick test and urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) measurements were performed. Patients with de novo NS findings, nasopharyngeal swab, and urine RT-PCR tests were performed simultaneously. RESULTS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted with 21 patients with COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 42.2+/-8.8 years, and 71.4% of them were male. The mean duration of follow-up was 28.4+/-9.3 days. The urine RT-PCR test was positive in one patient (4.8%). Improvements were observed in hematuria by 71.4%, and proteinuria by 85.7% at the end of the follow-up. A significant decrease in the measured UPCR was found in comparison to the baseline(P=0.000). Also, improvements were recorded in the complete blood counts, inflammatory parameters, ferritin, and coagulation tests, compared to the baseline. There was a positive correlation between baseline UPCR and ferritin, and a negative correlation between baseline UPCR and sodium values. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-induced de novo nephritic syndrome may occur mainly due to tubulointerstitial involvement and often results in spontaneous remission. However, why these findings were not present in all patients who had no comorbidities is not clear.","answer":"[\\"Diagnosis\\", \\"Treatment\\"]"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2018 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

Eighteen subjects were su bmi tted to  HH and  NH tests ( PIO2=120 hPa , 30 min ) before an expedition . Maximal and mean acute mountain sickness scores ( AMSmax and mean ) were determined using the self-report Lake Louise question naire scored daily .  Cardio-ventilatory ( f , VT , PetO2 and PetCO2 , HR and finger pulse oxymetry SpO2 )  were measured at times 5 and 30 min of the tests . Arterial ( PaO2 , PaCO2 , pH , SaO2 ) and capillary haemoglobin ( Hb ) measurements  were performed at times 30 min . Hypoxic ventilatory ( HVR ) and cardiac ( HCR ) responses , peripheral O2 blood content ( CpO2 ) were calculated . A significant time effect is found for ΔSpO2 ( P = 0.04 ) . Lower PaCO2 ( P = 0.005 ) , SaO2 ( P = 0.07 ) and higher pH ( P = 0.02 ) are observed in HH compared to NH . AMSmax varied from 3 to12 and AMSmean between 0.6 and 3.5 . In NH at 30 min , AMSmax is related to PetO2 ( R = 0.61 , P = 0.03 ) , CpO2 ( R = −0.53 , P = 0.02 ) and in HH to CpO2 ( R = −0.57 , P = 0.01 ) . In NH , AMSmean is related to Δf ( R = 0.46 , P = 0.05 ) , HCR ( R = 0.49 , P = 0.04 ) , CpO2 ( R = −0.51 , P = 0.03 ) and , in HH at 30 min , to VT ( R = 0.69 , P = 0.01 ) and a tendency for CpO2 ( R = −0.43 , P = 0.07 ) . We conclude that HH and NH tests are physiologically different and they must last 30 min . CpO2 is an important variable to predict AMS . For practical considerations , NH test is proposed to quantify AMS individual susceptibility using the formulas : AMSmax = 9.47 + 0.104PetO2(hPa)–0.68CpO2 ( % ) , ( R = 0.77 , P = 0.001 ) ; and AMSmean = 3.91 + 0.059Δf + 0.438HCR–0.135CpO2 ( R = 0.71 , P = 0.017 )Title 2:Sea level and acute responses to hypoxia: do they predict physiological responses and acute mountain sickness at altitude?Abstract 2:Objectives : To compare a range of physiological responses to acute sea level hypoxia at simulated altitudes with the same physiological responses and acute mountain sickness ( AMS ) scores measured at altitude ( similar to the simulated altitudes ) during a 17 day trek in the Himalayas . Methods : Twenty men and women aged 18–54 years took part in the study .  End tidal CO2 tension ( Petco2 ) and saturated oxygen ( Sao2 ) were measured using a capnograph . Observations made at sea level and some simulated altitudes were compared with those in the Himalayas . Pairwise correlations were used to examine the correlation between variables and regression , with 95 % prediction intervals providing information on how well one variable could be predicted from another for a given subject . Results : There was only a significant correlation for a few comparisons . The 95 % prediction intervals for individual Sao2 values at a range of simulated altitudes were fairly wide going from ± 4 % to ± 5 % . All of the correlations between laboratory and Himalayan Petco2 values were not statistically significant . There was a significant correlation for the relation between Sao2 and Petco2 at sea level for the laboratory data ( r=−0.51 ; p=0.05 ) . For the Himalayan data , there were significant correlations at Namche Bazaar ( 3450 m ; day 3 ) ( r=−0.56 ; p=0.01 ) and Dingboche ( 4300 m ; day 6 ) ( r=−0.48 ; p=0.03 ) . The correlation between Sao2 and Petco2 and AMS was generally poor . Conclusions : The results indicate that limited information can be gained on a subject 's response to altitude by assessing physiological variables at sea level and a range of simulated altitudes before the subject carries out a trek at altitudeTitle 3:Normo- and hypobaric hypoxia: are there any physiological differences?Abstract 3:Since Bert ( 1878 ) and Barcroft ( 1925 ) , studies on hypoxia are realized by lowering ambient O2 partial pressure ( PO2 ) either by barometric pressure reduction ( hypobaric hypoxia HH ) or by lowering the O2 fraction ( normobaric hypoxia NH ) . Today , a question is still debated : \\" are there any physiological differences between HH and NH for the same ambient PO2 ? \\" Since published studies are scarce and controversial , we su bmi tted 18 subjects in a r and om order to a 40-min HH test and to a 40-min NH test  at an ambient PO2  equal to 120 hPa ( 4500 m ) . Cardioventilatory variables [ breathing frequency ( f ) , tidal volume ( Vt ) , minute ventilation ( V̇E ) , O2 and CO2 end-tidal fractions or pressures ( FETO2 and FETCO2 or PETO2 and PETCO2 respectively ) , heart rate ( HR ) and O2 arterial saturation by pulse oxymetry ( SpO2 ) ] were measured throughout the tests . At the end of the tests , arterial blood sample s were taken to measure arterial blood gases [ O2 and CO2 arterial partial pressures ( PaO2 and PaCO2 ) , pH and O2 arterial saturation ( SaO2 ) ] . Results show that during HH compared to NH , f is greater ( P≤0.001 ) , Vt and V̇E under BTPS conditions are lower ( P≤0.05 ) , and FETO2 and FETCO2 are higher ( P≤0.05 ) . However , PETO2 does not change during the last 25 min of the tests , and neither does PETCO2 throughout the tests . HR is higher ( P≤0.05 ) and SpO2 lower ( P≤0.05 ) in HH compared to NH . Arterial blood data reveal that hypoxemia , hypocapnia and blood alkalosis are greater in HH compared to NH and that SaO2 is lower ( P≤0.05 ) . It is concluded that the physiological responses of humans su bmi tted to an acute hypoxia at a PO2 equal to 120 hPa differ according to the type of hypoxia . Compared to NH , HH leads to a greater hypoxemia , hypocapnia , blood alkalosis and a lower O2 arterial saturation . These physiological differences could be the consequence of an increase in dead space ventilation , probably related to the barometric pressure reduction , and could be grouped together under the term \\" the specific response to hypobaric hypoxia \\" . Knowledge of this specific response could improve the comprehension , prevention and treatment of altitude illnesses in the futureTitle 4:Ventilation, oxidative stress, and nitric oxide in hypobaric versus normobaric hypoxia.Abstract 4:PURPOSE Slight differences in physiological responses and nitric oxide ( NO ) have been reported at rest between hypobaric hypoxia  ( HH ) and normobaric hypoxia  ( NH ) during short exposure . Our study reports NO and oxidative stress at rest and physiological responses during moderate exercise in HH versus NH . METHODS Ten subjects were r and omly exposed for 24 h to HH  ( 3000 m ; FIO2 , 20.9 % ; BP , 530 ± 6 mm Hg ) or to NH  ( FIO2 , 14.7 % ; BP , 720 ± 1 mm Hg ) . Before and every 8 h during the hypoxic exposures , pulse oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) , HR , and gas exchanges were measured during a 6-min submaximal cycling exercise . At rest , the partial pressure of exhaled NO , blood nitrate and nitrite ( NOx ) , plasma levels of oxidative stress , and pH levels were additionally measured . RESULTS During exercise , minute ventilation was lower in HH compared with NH ( -13 % after 8 h , P < 0.05 ) . End-tidal CO2 pressure was lower ( P < 0.01 ) than PRE both in HH and NH but decreased less in HH than that in NH ( -25 % vs. -37 % , P < 0.05).At rest , exhaled NO and NOx decreased in HH ( -46 % and -36 % after 24 h , respectively , P < 0.05 ) whereas stable in NH . By contrast , oxidative stress was higher in HH than that in NH after 24 h ( P < 0.05 ) . The plasma pH level was stable in HH but increased in NH ( P < 0.01 ) . When compared with prenormoxic values , SpO2 , HR , oxygen consumption , breathing frequency , and end-tidal O2 pressure showed similar changes in HH and NH . CONCLUSION Lower ventilatory responses to a similar hypoxic stimulus during rest and exercise in HH versus NH were sustained for 24 h and associated with lower plasma pH level , exaggerated oxidative stress , and impaired NO bioavailabilityTitle 5:Acute mountain sickness: increased severity during simulated altitude compared with normobaric hypoxia.Abstract 5:Acute mountain sickness ( AMS ) strikes those in the mountains who go too high too fast . Although AMS has been long assumed to be due solely to the hypoxia of high altitude , recent evidence suggests that hypobaria may also make a significant contribution to the pathophysiology of AMS . We studied nine healthy men exposed to simulated altitude , normobaric hypoxia , and normoxic hypobaria in an environmental chamber for 9 h on separate occasions . To simulate altitude , the barometric pressure was lowered to 432 + /- 2 ( SE ) mmHg ( simulated terrestrial altitude 4,564 m ) . Normobaric hypoxia result ed from adding nitrogen to the chamber ( maintained near normobaric conditions ) to match the inspired PO2 of the altitude exposure . By lowering the barometric pressure and adding oxygen , we achieved normoxic hypobaria with the same inspired PO2 as in our laboratory at normal pressure . AMS symptom scores ( average scores from 6 and 9 h of exposure ) were higher during simulated altitude ( 3.7 + /- 0.8 ) compared with either normobaric hypoxia ( 2.0 + /- 0.8 ; P < 0.01 ) or normoxic hypobaria ( 0.4 + /- 0.2 ; P < 0.01 ) . In conclusion , simulated altitude induces AMS to a greater extent than does either normobaric hypoxia or normoxic hypobaria , although normobaric hypoxia induced some AMS","answer":"Several studies reported a number of variables ( e.g. minute ventilation and NO levels ) that were different between the two conditions , lending support to the notion that true physiological difference is indeed present ."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

We have carried out a detailed analysis of the cellular immune functions of breast cancer patients in comparison with healthy controls. A possible correlation between immune and clinical parameters was analysed in 50 breast cancer patients. Immune parameters, natural killer cell and T lymphocyte functions and the numbers of circulating T lymphocytes were analysed against the clinical parameters comprising the tumour burden, the stage of the disease and the expression of hormone receptors on the tumour. In order to analyse the immune function data effectively, low responders were identified with stringent cut-off values. Considerably higher proportions of low responders were found among the patient population. Elevated numbers of circulating T lymphocytes and CD3-directed cytolysis correlated with the expression of oestrogen receptors independently of the clinical / histological parameters.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"natural killer cell\\", \\"circulating T lymphocytes\\"], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"CD3\\", \\"hormone receptors\\", \\"oestrogen receptors\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Coadministration of NIZORAL  Tablets and drugs primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system may result in increased plasma concentrations of the drugs that could increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, appropriate dosage adjustments may be necessary. The following drug interactions have been identified involving NIZORAL Tablets and other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system: Ketoconazole tablets inhibit the metabolism of terfenadine, resulting in an increased plasma concentration of terfenadine and a delay in the elimination of its acid metabolite. The increased plasma concentration of terfenadine or its metabolite may result in prolonged QT intervals. Pharmacokinetic data indicate that oral ketoconazole inhibits the metabolism of astemizole, resulting in elevated plasma levels of astemizole and its active metabolite desmethylastemizole which may prolong QT intervals. Coadministration of astemizole with ketoconazole tablets is therefore contraindicated. Human pharmacokinetics data indicate that oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride. Data suggest that coadministration of oral ketoconazole and cisapride can result in prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG. Therefore concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with cisapride is contraindicated. Ketoconazole tablets may alter the metabolism of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and methylprednisolone, resulting in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter drugs. Dosage adjustment may be required if cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or methylprednisolone are given concomitantly with NIZORAL  Tablets. Coadministration of NIZORAL  Tablets with midazolam or triazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter two drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. These agents should not be used in patients treated with NIZORAL  Tablets. If midazolam is administered parenterally, special precaution is required since the sedative effect may be prolonged. Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. When taken orally , imidazole compounds like ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs. In simultaneous treatment with imidazole drugs and coumarin drugs, the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Because severe hypoglycemia has been reported in patients concomitantly receiving oral miconazole (an imidazole) and oral hypoglycemic agents, such a potential interaction involving the latter agents when used concomitantly with ketoconazole tablets (an imidazole) can not be ruled out. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with phenytoin may alter the metabolism of one or both of the drugs. It is suggested to monitor both ketoconazole and phenytoin. Concomitant administration of rifampin with ketoconazole tablets reduces the blood levels of the latter. INH (Isoniazid) is also reported to affect ketoconazole concentrations adversely. These drugs should not be given concomitantly. After the coadministration of 200 mg oral ketoconazole twice daily and one 20 mg dose of loratadine to 11 subjects, the AUC and Cmax of loratadine averaged 302% (  142 S.D.) and 251% (  68 S.D.), respectively, of those obtained after co-treatment with placebo. The AUC and Cmax of descarboethoxyloratadine, an active metabolite, averaged 155% (  27 S.D.) and 141% (  35 S.D.), respectively. However, no related changes were noted in the QT0 on ECG taken at 2, 6, and 24 hours after the coadministration. Also, there were no clinically significant differences in adverse events when loratadine was administered with or without ketoconazole. Rare cases of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol have been reported. These experiences have been characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea, and headache. Symptoms resolved within a few hours.","answer":"{\\"Brand\\": [\\"NIZORAL\\"], \\"Drug\\": [\\"rifampin\\", \\"cyclosporine\\", \\"phenytoin\\", \\"triazolam\\", \\"digoxin\\", \\"INH\\", \\"miconazole\\", \\"alcohol\\", \\"terfenadine\\", \\"cisapride\\", \\"astemizole\\", \\"methylprednisolone\\", \\"ketoconazole\\", \\"loratadine\\", \\"Isoniazid\\", \\"Ketoconazole\\", \\"tacrolimus\\", \\"midazolam\\"], \\"DrugGroup\\": [\\"hypoglycemic agents\\", \\"imidazole compounds\\", \\"imidazole\\", \\"coumarin\\", \\"imidazole drugs\\", \\"coumarin drugs\\"], \\"UnapprovedDrug\\": [\\"descarboethoxyloratadine\\", \\"desmethylastemizole\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Current evidence suggests that aniridia (absence of iris) is caused by loss of function of one copy of the PAX6 gene, which maps to 11p13. We present the further characterisation of two aniridia pedigrees in which the disease segregates with chromosomal rearrangements which involve 11p13 but do not disrupt the PAX6 gene. We have isolated three human YAC clones which encompass the PAX6 locus and we have used these to show that in both cases the chromosomal breakpoint is at least 85 kb distal of the 3 end of PAX6. In addition, the open reading frame of PAX6 is apparently free of mutations. We propose that the PAX6 gene on the rearranged chromosome 11 is in an inappropriate chromatin environment for normal expression and therefore that a position effect is the underlying mechanism of disease in these families..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"aniridia\\", \\"absence of iris\\", \\"Aniridia\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Calcium binding to thin filaments is a major element controlling active force generation in striated muscles. Recent evidence suggests that processes other than Ca(2+) binding, such as phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) also controls contraction of vertebrate striated muscle (Cooke, R. (2011) Biophys. Rev. 3, 33-45). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies using nucleotide analog spin label probes showed that dephosphorylated myosin heads are highly ordered in the relaxed fibers and have very low ATPase activity. This ordered structure of myosin cross-bridges disappears with the phosphorylation of RLC (Stewart, M. (2010) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 107, 430-435). The slower ATPase activity in the dephosporylated moiety has been defined as a new super-relaxed state (SRX). It can be observed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers (Hooijman, P., Stewart, M. A., and Cooke, R. (2011) Biophys. J. 100, 1969-1976). Given the importance of the finding that suggests a novel pathway of regulation of skeletal muscle, we aim to examine the effects of phosphorylation on cross-bridge orientation and rotational motion. We find that: (i) relaxed cross-bridges, but not active ones, are statistically better ordered in muscle where the RLC is dephosporylated compared with phosphorylated RLC; (ii) relaxed phosphorylated and dephosphorylated cross-bridges rotate equally slowly; and (iii) active phosphorylated cross-bridges rotate considerably faster than dephosphorylated ones during isometric contraction but the duty cycle remained the same, suggesting that both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated muscles develop the same isometric tension at full Ca(2+) saturation. A simple theory was developed to account for this fact.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"nucleotide\\", \\"Calcium\\", \\"Ca(2+)\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

(2015b).Recently, Han et al. extended their work by combining Network Pruning with quantization (to 8 bits or less) and huffman encoding to create an approach called Deep Compression Han et al. (2015a), and further designed a hardware accelerator called EIE Han et al. (2016a) that operates directly on the compressed model, achieving substantial speedups and energy savings.Question: What is an example of model compression approaches?","answer":"different examples can be: Applying SVD to a pretrained CNN model through which we can obtain most effective parameters or features of largest singular values of this factorization if we want.

Also Network Pruning, which begins with a pretrained model, then replaces parameters that are below a certain threshold with zeros to form a sparse matrix, and finally performs a few iterations of training on the sparse CNN Maybe seen as another example .

We provide genetic evidence supporting the identity of the candidate gene for BRCA1 through the characterization of germline mutations in 63 breast cancer patients and 10 ovarian cancer patients in ten families with cancer linked to chromosome 17q21. Nine different mutations were detected by screening BRCA1 DNA and RNA by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. Seven mutations lead to protein truncations at sites throughout the gene. One missense mutation (which occurred independently in two families) leads to loss of a cysteine in the zinc binding domain. An intronic single basepair substitution destroys an acceptor site and activates a cryptic splice site, leading to a 59 basepair insertion and chain termination. The four families with both breast and ovarian cancer had chain termination mutations in the N-terminal half of the protein..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"breast cancer\\", \\"ovarian cancer\\", \\"cancer\\", \\"breast and ovarian cancer\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

These taxa survive as small, isolated populations in remote streams and springs and evolved to tolerate extreme conditions of high temperature and low dissolved oxygen. Both species have experienced severe population declines over the last 50-60years that led to some subspecies being categorized with protected status under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Here we report the first sequencing of the complete mitochondrial DNA genomes for both E. l. latos and the moapae subspecies of C. baileyi. Complete mitogenomes of 16,546bp nucleotides were obtained from two E. l. latos individuals collected from introduced populations at Spring Mountain Ranch State Park and Shoshone Ponds Natural Area, Nevada, USA, while a single mitogenome of 16,537bp was sequenced for C. b. moapae. The mitogenomes of both species contain 13 protein - encoding genes, twenty-two tRNAs, and two rRNAs (12S and 18S) following the syntenic arrangement typical of Actinopterygiian fish mitogenomes, as well as D-loop control regions of 858bp for E. latos and 842bp for C. baileyi moapae. The two E. latos individuals exhibited only 0.0181% nucleotide sequence divergence across the entire mitogenome, implying little intraspecific mtDNA genetic variation. Comparative phylogenetic analysis of the poolfish and springfish mitochondrial genomes to available mitogenomes of other Cyprinodontoid fishes confirmed the close relationship of these oviparous Empetrichthys and Crenichthys genera to the viviparous goodeid fishes of central Mexico, and showed the combined clade of these fishes to be a sister group to the Profundulidae killifishes. Despite several significant life history and morphological differences between the Empetrichthyinae and Goodienae, estimates of evolutionary genetic distances using two partial regions of mtDNA point to inclusion of the Empetrichthys and Crenichthys genera within the family Goodeidae along with the goodeid fishes of central Mexico.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"genes\\", \\"mitogenome\\", \\"mitochondrial DNA genomes\\", \\"mitochondrial genomes\\", \\"mitogenomes\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"oviparous\\", \\"syntenic\\", \\"arrangement\\", \\"viviparous\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"protein\\", \\"rRNAs\\", \\"mtDNA\\", \\"tRNAs\\", \\"dissolved oxygen\\", \\"16,546bp nucleotides\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"cyprinodontoid fishes\\", \\"C. baileyi moapae\\", \\"goodeid fishes\\", \\"Empetrichthys latos\\", \\"killifishes\\", \\"moapae\\", \\"Goodienae\\", \\"Empetrichthys\\", \\"Actinopterygiian fish\\", \\"Pahrump poolfish\\", \\"springfish\\", \\"fishes\\", \\"E. l. latos\\", \\"poolfish\\", \\"White River springfish\\", \\"Cyprinodontoid fishes\\", \\"C. baileyi\\", \\"Crenichthys baileyi\\", \\"Empetrichthyinae\\", \\"Goodeidae\\", \\"Crenichthys\\", \\"teleost fishes\\", \\"Profundulidae\\", \\"Cyprinodontiformes\\", \\"C. b. moapae\\", \\"E. latos\\"], \\"Finding\\": [\\"confirmed\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"sequencing\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"species\\", \\"genera\\", \\"subspecies\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"introduced populations\\", \\"populations\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"phylogenetic analysis\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"Great Basin\\", \\"Spring Mountain Ranch State Park\\", \\"Mexico\\", \\"nucleotide sequence\\", \\"USA\\", \\"Mojave Desert\\", \\"western\\", \\"North America\\", \\"Shoshone Ponds Natural Area\\", \\"regions\\", \\"desert\\", \\"morphological\\", \\"central\\", \\"Nevada\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma Cooperative Study Group . Alpha interferon has shown initial promise in the treatment of low-grade non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) , especially with the nodular form of the disease . The present study enrolled 70 NHL patients who received either chlorambucil ( CB ; 10 mg/day ) or CB plus interferon alfa-2b ( 5 million units ( MU ) /m2 subcutaneously three times a week ) . Among 63 evaluable patients , similar response rates ( 62.1 % and 64.7 % respectively ) were recorded for the treatment arms . In patients receiving no maintenance therapy , those who received interferon alfa-2b during the induction phase showed a favourable trend in terms of incidence of relapse compared to those who had received chlorambucil alone . During maintenance therapy with interferon alfa-2b , no significant differences in the occurrence of relapse have yet been seen compared to patients on no maintenance therapy . A longer observation period is needed to make a definitive conclusion about the usefulness of interferon maintenance therapy and to evaluate further the effects of the combined schedule of chlorambucil and interferon induction on the duration of remission .","answer":"{\\"Intervention\\": [\\"interferon\\", \\"CB\\", \\"chlorambucil\\", \\"CB plus interferon alfa-2b\\", \\"interferon alfa-2b\\", \\"Alpha interferon\\", \\"interferon maintenance therapy\\"], \\"Outcome\\": [\\"occurrence of relapse\\", \\"incidence of relapse\\"], \\"Participant\\": [\\"63\\", \\"70\\", \\"Non-Hodgkin u0027s Lymphoma\\", \\"no maintenance therapy\\", \\"non-Hodgkin u0027s lymphoma\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who progressed after IFL therapy were randomly assigned to bolus and infusional FU and leucovorin (LV5FU2), single-agent oxaliplatin, or the combination (FOLFOX4). This planned interim analysis evaluated objective response rate (RR), time to tumor progression (TTP), and alleviation of tumor-related symptoms (TRS) in an initial cohort of patients.                Between November 2000 and September 2001, 463 patients from 120 sites in North America were randomly assigned to treatment. FOLFOX4 proved superior to LV5FU2 in all measures of clinical efficacy. Objective RRs determined by an independent radiology panel were 9.9% for FOLFOX4 versus 0% for LV5FU2 (Fisher's exact test, P <.0001). Median TTP was 4.6 months for FOLFOX4 versus 2.7 months for LV5FU2 (two-sided, stratified log-rank test, P <.0001). Relief of TRS occurred in 33% of patients treated with FOLFOX4 versus 12% of patients treated with LVFU2 (chi2 test, P <.001). Single-agent oxaliplatin was not superior to LV5FU2 in any measure of efficacy. Patients treated with FOLFOX4 experienced a higher incidence of clinically significant toxicities than patients treated with LV5FU2, but these toxicities were predictable and did not result in a higher rate of treatment discontinuation or 60-day mortality rate.                For patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, second-line treatment with FOLFOX4 is superior to treatment with LVFU2 in terms of RR, TTP, and relief of TRS.Title 2:A phase III study of irinotecan (CPT-11) versus best supportive care in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have failed 5-fluorouracil therapy. V301 Study Group.Abstract 2:In a prospective multicenter trial, 279 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had failed 5-fluorouracil therapy were randomized 2:1 to receive either best supportive care (BSC) plus treatment with the topoisomerase I inhibitor, irinotecan (CPT-11; Rhône-Poulenc Rorer, Antony, France), at a dose of 350 mg/m2 every 3 weeks or BSC alone. Overall survival, the primary end point of the study, was significantly improved in patients receiving the irinotecan treatment. Only 14% of patients receiving BSC alone were alive at 1 year compared with 36% in the irinotecan group. After adjustment for prognostic factors such as performance status, the difference in survival favoring irinotecan remained highly significant (P = .001). The benefit of irinotecan was also observed through significantly longer survival without performance status deterioration, longer survival without more than 5% weight loss, and longer duration of pain-free survival. Appreciable deterioration in global quality of life (50% reduction from baseline) occurred significantly later in the irinotecan-treated patients than in the controls. Additionally, quality of life analyses of all symptoms, except diarrhea, mean scores were significantly in favor of patients assigned to irinotecan treatment than those assigned to BSC. This is the first time that the benefit of second-line chemotherapy has been demonstrated by a randomized controlled trial in advanced colorectal cancer.Title 3:Randomised trial of irinotecan versus fluorouracil by continuous infusion after fluorouracil failure in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.Abstract 3:In phase II trials, irinotecan is active in patients with advanced colorectal cancer, but the survival and clinical benefit of irinotecan compared with second-line fluorouracil by continuous infusion is not known.                267 patients who had failed to respond to first-line fluorouracil, or whose disease had progressed after treatment with first-line fluorouracil were randomly allocated irinotecan 300-350 mg/m2 infused once every 3 weeks or fluorouracil by continuous infusion. Treatment was given until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or the patient refused to continue treatment. The primary endpoint was survival, while progression-free survival, response rate, symptom-free survival, adverse events, and quality of life (QoL) were secondary endpoints.                133 patients were randomly allocated irinotecan and 134 were allocated fluorouracil by continuous infusion. Patients treated with irinotecan lived for significantly longer than patients on fluorouracil (p=0.035). Survival at 1 year was increased from 32% in the fluorouracil group to 45% in the irinotecan group. Median survival was 10.8 months in the irinotecan group and 8.5 months in the fluorouracil group. Median progression-free survival was longer with irinotecan (4.2 vs 2.9 months for irinotecan vs fluorouracil, respectively; p=0.030). The median pain-free survival was 10.3 months and 8.5 months (p=0.06) for irinotecan and fluorouracil, respectively. Both treatments were equally well tolerated. QoL was similar in both groups.                Compared with fluorouracil by continuous infusion second-line irinotecan significantly improved survival in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.Title 4:Phase III comparison of two irinotecan dosing regimens in second-line therapy of metastatic colorectal cancer.Abstract 4:Randomized trials in fluorouracil (FU)-refractory colorectal cancer demonstrate significant survival advantages for patients receiving irinotecan. We prospectively compared the efficacy and tolerability of two irinotecan regimens (once a week for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week rest period [weekly] v once every 3 weeks) in such patients.                This multicenter, open-label, phase III study randomly assigned patients in a 1:2 ratio to irinotecan given either weekly (125 mg/m(2)) or once every 3 weeks (350 mg/m(2), or 300 mg/m(2) in patients who were >/= 70 years of age, who had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status equal to 2, or who had prior pelvic irradiation).                With median follow-up of 15.8 months, there was no significant difference in 1-year survival (46% v 41%, respectively; P =.42), median survival (9.9 v 9.9 months, respectively; P =.43), or median time to progression (4.0 v 3.0 months, respectively; P =.54) between the two regimens. Grade 3/4 diarrhea occurred in 36% of patients treated weekly and in 19% of those treated once every 3 weeks (P =.002). Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 29% of patients treated weekly and 34% of those treated once every 3 weeks (P =.35). Treatment-related mortality occurred in five patients (5.3%) receiving irinotecan weekly and three patients (1.6%) given therapy once every 3 weeks (P =.12). Global quality of life was not statistically different between treatment groups.                Irinotecan schedules of weekly and of once every 3 weeks demonstrated similar efficacy and quality of life in patients with FU-refractory, metastatic colorectal cancer. The regimen of once every 3 weeks was associated with a significantly lower incidence of severe diarrhea.Title 5:A randomized trial comparing defined-duration with continuous irinotecan until disease progression in fluoropyrimidine and thymidylate synthase inhibitor-resistant advanced colorectal cancer.Abstract 5:Irinotecan given until disease progression is an accepted standard treatment for advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) resistant to fluoropyrimidines. It is not known whether a predefined period of irinotecan treatment would result in similar duration of disease control. We performed a multicenter phase III trial to compare the two policies of defined-duration versus continuous irinotecan treatment.                Three hundred thirty-three eligible patients with advanced CRC progressing on or within 24 weeks of completing fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy were prospectively registered. After receiving eight cycles of irinotecan given at 350 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks, 55 patients with responding or stable disease were randomly assigned to stop irinotecan (n = 30) or continue until disease progression (n = 25). Registered patients were not randomly assigned predominantly due to disease progression (n = 236) and intolerable toxicity (n = 38).                From the time of random assignment, there were no differences in failure-free survival (P = .999) or overall survival (P = .11) between the two arms. No difference was seen in mean global health status quality-of-life score between the two arms at 12 weeks after random assignment. No grade 3 diarrhea and febrile neutropenia was seen in the continue-irinotecan arm after random assignment.                For most patients, the decision to continue on irinotecan beyond 24 weeks is influenced by disease progression or treatment-related toxicity. However, for 17% of patients in whom this decision is clinically relevant, there seems to be little benefit from continuing irinotecan, though the drug was well tolerated without any deterioration in quality of life.

BACKGROUND Acute phase protein production is a hallmark of severe burns . We wondered whether anabolic treatment with oxandrolone would affect these proteins . METHODS Thirty-five children with > or =40 % total body surface area burns were randomized to receive either placebo or oxandrolone ( 0.1 mg/kg by mouth twice daily ) from postoperative day 5 to 1 year postburn . Levels of constitutive proteins and acute phase proteins were measured at admission ; at discharge ; and at 6 , 9 , and 12 months after burn . Total albumin supplementation and hepatic transaminases were also assessed . RESULTS Constitutive proteins such as albumin , prealbumin , and retinol-binding protein levels increased ( p < 0.05 ) , and acute phase proteins such as alpha 1-acid glycoprotein , C3 complement , alpha 2-macroglobulin , and fibrinogen levels significantly decreased in the oxandrolone group compared with placebo ( p < 0.05 ) . Albumin supplementation during the acute hospitalization was reduced in the oxandrolone group . Hepatic transaminases remained within normal levels .

We describe the isolation of human LH-2, a putative transcription factor containing two cysteine-rich regions (LIM domains) and a homeobox (Hox) DNA-binding domain. High levels of hLH-2 expression were observed in all cases of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) tested, regardless of disease status. hLH-2 was mapped to chromosome 9Q33-34. 1, in the same region as the reciprocal translocation that creates the BCR-ABL chimera of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph '), the hallmark of CML; hLH-2 was retained on the derivative 9 chromosome and is therefore centromeric of c-ABL. The proximity of hLH-2 to the breakpoint on chromosome 9 raises the possibility of cis-activation by the t (9;22) (q34;q11) translocation. In addition to finding hLH-2 expression in all cases of CML, expression was observed in lymphoid malignancies and myeloid cell lines, but not in primary cases of acute myelogenous leukaemia. The role of hLH-2 in the development or progression of leukaemia is not known. However, hLH-2 may prove useful as a marker of CML for monitoring residual disease.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"myeloid cell lines\\"], \\"CellType\\": [], \\"DNA\\": [\\"the same region\\", \\"c - ABL\\", \\"chromosome 9\\", \\"hLH - 2\\", \\"t (9;22) (q34;q11) translocation\\", \\"derivative 9 chromosome\\", \\"chromosome 9Q33 - 34 . 1\\", \\"human LIM - Hox gene\\", \\"9q33 - 34 . 1\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"LIM domains\\", \\"human LH - 2\\", \\"putative transcription factor\\", \\"homeobox (Hox) DNA - binding domain\\", \\"BCR - ABL chimera\\", \\"cysteine - rich regions\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

Studies have shown that cold - related excessive mortality is especially relevant with decreasing latitude or in regions with mild winter. However, only limited studies have been conducted in the southern U.S. The purpose of our study is to examine impacts of cold weather on mortality in 12 major Texas Metropolitan Areas (MSAs) for the 22- year period, 1990-2011. Our study used a two-stage approach to examine the cold - mortality association. We first applied distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) to 12 major MSAs to estimate cold effects for each area. A random effects meta-analysis was then used to estimate pooled effects. Age-stratified and cause - specific mortalities were modeled separately for each MSA. Most of the MSAs were associated with an increased risk in mortality ranging from 0.1% to 5.0% with a 1 °C decrease in temperature below the cold thresholds. Higher increased mortality risks were generally observed in MSAs with higher average daily mean temperatures and lower latitudes. Pooled effect estimate was 1.58% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) [0.81, 2.37]) increase in all- cause mortality risk with a 1 °C decrease in temperature. Cold wave effects in Texas were also examined, and several MSAs along the Texas Gulf Coast showed statistically significant cold wave - mortality associations. Effects of cold on all- cause mortality were highest among people over 75 years old (1.86%, 95% CI [1.09, 2.63]). Pooled estimates for cause - specific mortality were strongest in myocardial infarction (4.30%, 95% CI [1.18, 7.51]), followed by respiratory diseases (3.17%, 95% CI [0.26, 6.17]) and ischemic heart diseases (2.54%, 95% CI [1.08, 4.02]). In conclusion, cold weather generally increases mortality risk significantly in Texas, and the cold effects vary with MSAs, age groups, and cause - specific deaths.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"ischemic heart diseases\\", \\"respiratory diseases\\", \\"myocardial infarction\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"decreasing\\", \\"examined\\", \\"examine\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [\\"cold effects\\"], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"people\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"study\\", \\"meta-analysis\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"southern\\", \\"Texas\\", \\"U.S.\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The possibility of hypotensive effects with Lotensin can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with Lotensin. If this is not possible, the starting dose should be reduced. Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics Lotensin can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently. Oral Anticoagulants Interaction studies with warfarin and acenocoumarol failed to identify any clinically important effects on the serum concentrations or clinical effects of these anticoagulants. Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased. Other No clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred when Lotensin was administered concomitantly with hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, furosemide, digoxin, propranolol, atenolol, naproxen, or cimetidine. Lotensin has been used concomitantly with beta-adrenergic-blocking agents, calcium-channel-blocking agents, diuretics, digoxin, and hydralazine, without evidence of clinically important adverse interactions. Benazepril, like other ACE inhibitors, has had less than additive effects with beta-adrenergic blockers, presumably because both drugs lower blood pressure by inhibiting parts of the renin-angiotensin system .","answer":"{\\"Brand\\": [\\"Lotensin\\"], \\"Drug\\": [\\"potassium\\", \\"Benazepril\\", \\"acenocoumarol\\", \\"spironolactone\\", \\"chlorthalidone\\", \\"propranolol\\", \\"furosemide\\", \\"hydrochlorothiazide\\", \\"amiloride\\", \\"warfarin\\", \\"Potassium\\", \\"lithium\\", \\"triamterene\\", \\"digoxin\\", \\"naproxen\\", \\"Lithium\\", \\"atenolol\\", \\"hydralazine\\", \\"cimetidine\\"], \\"DrugGroup\\": [\\"thiazide diuretics\\", \\"diuretics\\", \\"calcium-channel-blocking agents\\", \\"beta-adrenergic-blocking agents\\", \\"diuretic\\", \\"Potassium-sparing diuretics\\", \\"anticoagulants\\", \\"ACE inhibitors\\", \\"Anticoagulants\\", \\"Diuretics\\", \\"Potassium-Sparing Diuretics\\", \\"beta-adrenergic blockers\\"], \\"UnapprovedDrug\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

CNEs exhibit unexplained extreme levels of sequence conservation, with many acting as developmental long-range enhancers. Clusters of CNEs define the span of regulatory inputs for many important developmental regulators and have been described previously as genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs). Their function and distribution around important regulatory genes raises the question of how they relate to 3D conformation of these loci. Here, we show that clusters of CNEs strongly coincide with topological organisation, predicting the boundaries of hundreds of topologically associating domains (TADs) in human and Drosophila. The set of TADs that are associated with high levels of noncoding conservation exhibit distinct properties compared to TADs devoid of extreme noncoding conservation. The close correspondence between extreme noncoding conservation and TADs suggests that these TADs are ancient, revealing a regulatory architecture conserved over hundreds of millions of years.Metazoan genomes contain many clusters of conserved noncoding elements.

old female with no past medical history who presented to the emergency department with complaints of intractable nausea , vomiting , hiccups and abdominal pain . around thanksgiving 2012 , she had had bronchitis and sinusitis .she had been treated with tylenol cold and cough , a z - pak , inhalers and tessalon perles .this had progressively worsened into intractable nausea and vomiting about 4 days following thanksgiving and lasted till presentation , which was about 2 weeks after onset .complete blood count revealed hemoglobin of 10.1 g / dl , a hematocrit of 31.2% , a platelet count of 225  103/l and white blood cell count of 6.9  10/l .serum electrolytes were as follows : na 136 mmol / l , k 3.6 mmol / l , cl 105mmol / l , hco3 23 mmol / l , bun 10 mg / dl and creatinine 1.3 mg / dl .she had a right upper quadrant ultrasound that showed some stones within the gallbladder , but no findings suggestive of acute cholecystitis .gastroenterology was consulted and she had an egd that showed mild esophagitis for which she was placed on a proton pump inhibitor .serial daily labs including complete blood count and basic metabolic profile did not reveal any abnormalities . while in the hospital , she was noticed to have a positive babinski 's test on daily physical examination , which was a new finding that had been absent on presentation . at this pointshe had an mri without contrast showing moderate diffuse atrophy , most particularly in the occipital area ( she denied any prior head trauma or problems at birth ) and very few scattered white matter hyperintensities ( she has a history of tobacco abuse ) .she went on to have a brain mri with and without contrast with results showing small foci of linear abnormal t2 signal with questionable associated vague enhancement at the posterior aspect of the brainstem , in the region that anatomically corresponds to the area postrema ( fig . 1 , figthis finding was suspicious for a variant presentation of nmo with intractable nausea / vomiting .following this finding , she was started on 1 g of iv solu - medrol daily .the day after her first dose of solu - medrol , she was symptom - free and asked for a diet , which she tolerated well .however , the patient started feeling better on solu - medrol and deferred the procedure , saying she would consider it if her symptoms recurred .after 5 days on iv solu - medrol and still symptom - free , she was transitioned to oral steroids and discharged with a taper . she was asked to follow up with the neurology clinic and her primary care doctor .other lab work done included tsh , rpr , heavy metals , uds and serum ace , which all came back negative or within normal range .at the clinic , she was started on rituximab and has remained symptom - free till the writing of this article .intractable nausea and vomiting is a commonly encountered problem in any general medicine or gastroenterology service .several causes from infection to chronic medical conditions , such as diabetic gastroparesis and gastroparesis due to multiple causes , can be listed .nmo , also known as devic 's disease , is a rare autoimmune disorder in which a patient 's immune system affects the optic nerves and spinal cord , leading to loss of vision and spinal cord dysfunction [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] .spinal cord dysfunction is mainly manifested as weakness , paralysis , numbness and possibly bowel and bladder incontinence . due to these symptoms , nmo can often be confused with ms . as rare a diseaseas nmo is , it is even rarer for intractable nausea and vomiting to be the only initial presenting symptoms , and this is sparsely mentioned in reviewed literature .nmo is caused by the development of autoantibodies ( nmo -

Here, we show that deletion of the ancient cell-fate regulator Numb( Nb) and its homologue Numblike( Nbl) depletes CPCs in second pharyngeal arches( PA2s) and is associated with an atrophic heart. With histological, flow cytometric and functional analyses, we find that CPCs remain undifferentiated and expansive in the PA2, but differentiate into cardiac cells as they exit the arch. Tracing of Nb- and Nbl-deficient CPCs by lineage-specific mosaicism reveals that the CPCs normally populate in the PA2, but lose their expansion potential in the PA2. These findings demonstrate that Nb and Nbl are intrinsic factors crucial for the renewal of CPCs in the PA2 and that the PA2 serves as a microenvironment for their expansion.Introduction:Embryonic cardiac progenitor cells( CPCs), identified from early embryos or differentiating pluripotent stem cells, hold tremendous regenerative potential with their unique capability to expand and differentiate into nearly all cell types of the heart( Parmacek and Epstein, 2005; Kattman et al., 2006; Moretti et al., 2006; Kwon et al., 2007). Over the past decade, significant progress in developmental cardiology led to the identification of CPC markers and lineages( Cai et al., 2003; Kattman et al., 2006; Moretti et al., 2006; Kwon et al., 2009). However, CPCs are highly heterogeneous and it is unknown if they can undergo self-renewal without differentiation. Consequently, understanding the precise mechanisms of CPC self-renewal and maintenance remains a fundamental challenge. Cardiogenesis initiates as the basic helix-loop-helix protein mesoderm posterior 1( Mesp1) is transiently expressed in the nascent mesoderm during gastrulation( Saga et al., 1996). Mesp1+ cells migrate anteriorly and form the first heart field( FHF) and second heart field( SHF)( Saga et al., 2000). The FHF gives rise to the atria and left ventricle( LV), whereas the outflow tract( OT), right ventricle( RV) and some of atria are derived from the SHF( Buckingham et al., 2005). Before myocardialization, subsets of Mesp1 progeny express CPC markers including Islet1( Isl1), fetal liver kinase 1( Flk1), Nkx2. 5, or myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2c( Mef2c) in precardiac mesoderm( Stanley et al., 2002; Cai et al., 2003; Verzi et al., 2005; Kattman et al., 2006). Isl1 and Flk1 expression is extinguished as CPCs adopt myocardial fates, but Nkx2. 5 and Mef2c are continually expressed in cardiomyocytes( Edmondson et al., 1994; Tanaka et al., 1999). While CPCs expressing these markers have similar differentiation potential in vitro( Kattman et al., 2006; Moretti et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2006), it is unknown if a discrete population of stem cell-like CPCs exist to supply cells for cardiac growth and morphogenesis during development. Numb and Numblike( Numbl)—mammalian Numb homologs sharing collinear topology and extensive sequence identity with functional redundancy—are evolutionarily conserved proteins that are required for the self-renewal of neural progenitors and mediate asymmetric cell divisions in various contexts of cell fate decisions( Zhong et al., 1997; Petersen et al., 2002, 2004; Roegiers and Jan, 2004), but their role in CPC development has not been explored. In the current study, we sought to identify and investigate CPCs affected by Numb and Numbl. By taking combinatorial approaches, we demonstrate that Mesp1+ progenitor-derived Isl1+ Nkx2. 5− cells renew and expand without cardiac differentiation in the second pharyngeal arch( PA2) and that PA2 serves as their microenvironment during mammalian heart development.Discussion:Through the use of mouse genetics, lineage-specific mosaicism, embryonic stem cell systems, and ex-vivo organ culture, we have shown the existence of an undifferentiated and expansive population of CPCs and their microenvironment during development( Figure 7), which may provide a stem cell-niche paradigm in cardiovascular biology. Given that the heart grows rapidly in size and cell number at E8. 5–10. 5, the CPCs may serve as a renewable source to supply the number of cardiac cells needed to sustain the ensuing heart growth. 10. 7554/eLife. 02164. 023Figure 7. Model for Renewal and Niche of Mesp1+ progenitor-derived CPCs. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 02164. 023 Although highly heterogeneous, CPCs are considered as multipotent cells that are destined to become heart cells. However, it remains unclear if they are capable to self-renew without differentiation. In mice, their precursors are identified as early as E5. 75 by expression of the T-box transcription factor Eomesodermin in the epiblast( Russ et al., 2000) and specified to Mesp1+ cells at the onset of gastrulation at E6. 5( Costello et al., 2011). Mesp1+ cells are further specified to CPCs, vascular progenitors and some of the head mesenchyme that contribute to the entire heart, vasculature and subsets of head muscle cells, respectively( Saga et al., 2000). CPCs giving rise to the RV migrate through the OT from the SHF and express the transcription factors Isl1, Mef2c or Nkx2. 5. These factors, however, are also expressed in neighboring cells including pharyngeal ectoderm and endoderm, foregut endoderm, neural progenitors and neural crest cells that are not originated from mesoderm( Lints et al., 1993; Edmondson et al., 1994; Cai et al., 2003), making it difficult to precisely discern CPCs. Moreover, it is unclear when and where CPCs are specified from Mesp1+ cells or their progeny. Thus, we traced Mesp1 lineages and examined the expression of CPC markers in Mesp1 progeny. Unexpectedly, heart cells rarely proliferated during early cardiogenesis, implying the existence of an alternate cell source for the ongoing growth of the heart. Indeed, we found a proliferative cluster of Mesp1+ cell-derived Isl1+ Nkx2. 5−cells in the PA2—directly linked to the Isl1+ Nkx2. 5+ OT of the growing heart—that migrated to the heart and became heart cells. The Isl1+ Nkx2. 5− CPCs continued to expand in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro without cardiac differentiation in the PA2, suggesting that the CPCs may serve as a renewable cell source for the developing heart. This cell renewal system may provide a parsimonious and efficient way to quickly generate a large number of cells used to build the heart during embryogenesis, which can be advantageous over local proliferation of differentiated cardiac cells. Further characterization of the CPCs will be necessary to provide quantitative information on their cellular contribution to the developing heart. Recent studies suggested that subsets of head and cardiac muscles share their progenitors( Lescroart et al., 2010). While the progenitor has not been identified, it will be interesting to investigate if this progenitor is derived from Isl1+ Nkx2. 5− cells. PAs are transient, segmented bulges that appear on the craniolateral side of developing embryos( Grevellec and Tucker, 2010). Each PA is composed of a mesodermal core and neural crest cell–derived mesenchymal cells that are surrounded by ectoderm outside and endoderm inside. At E8. 5, the PA1—positioned most cranially among PAs—is structurally distinct, while the PA2 becomes noticeable after E9. 0. Mesp1-derived Isl1+ Nkx2. 5− cells proliferate in PA2s and initiate expression of Nkx2. 5+ soon after exiting the arch. This suggests that PA2s function as a microenvironment to maintain the CPCs in an undifferentiated and expanding state and likely contain cells secreting paracrine factors that control the CPC number and fate. In fact, numerous signaling molecules are secreted from PA endoderm, ectoderm, and mesenchyme including Wnts, bone morphogenetic proteins, sonic hedgehog, and fibroblast growth factors( Rochais et al., 2009), and dysregulation of these signals is often associated with OT/RV defects( Frank et al., 2002; Stottmann et al., 2004; Washington Smoak et al., 2005; Kwon et al., 2007). Thus, it will be important to identify the extrinsic factors and cell types that provide key signals for the CPC maintenance and PA2 development. Although the heart phenotype( hypoplastic OT/RV) caused by Numb/Numbl DKO may not result entirely from CPC depletion in the PA2, our findings together with published literatures suggest that the CPCs in the PA2 might be a major source of cells contributing to the OT/RV. For instance, the SHF—giving rise to the entire OT/RV—is located in PAs( Kelly et al., 2001; Rochais et al., 2009) and we found that proliferating cells are present predominantly in the PA1 and PA2 and rarely detected in the rest of the PAs. Our ex-vivo culture further showed that PA2 cells robustly differentiate into cardiac cells, whereas PA1 cells appear to give rise to myotubes without cells expressing Nkx2. 5. It is also worth noting that nearly all, if not all, embryos showing severely hypoplastic OT/RV exhibit hypoplastic PA2s( Srivastava et al., 1997; Gottlieb et al., 2002; Cai et al., 2003; Kwon et al., 2007, 2009). Numb and Numbl are highly conserved proteins that participate in cell fate determination by mediating asymmetric division, endocytosis and recycling of specific proteins, ubiquitination and cell migration( Santolini et al., 2000; Cayouette and Raff, 2002). Classic studies of Drosophila demonstrated Numb's spatio-temporal segregation to one pole of the mitotic cell as the primary mechanism by which cell fate is determined in single organ precursors( Uemura et al., 1989). In mammals, Numb and Numbl are required for the self-renewal of neural progenitors to maintain their number during development; while in the other settings they promote a neuronal fate by neural progenitor specification( Petersen et al., 2002, 2004). Similarly, Numb and Numbl were required for the renewal of CPCs during cardiogenesis, suggesting a conserved role in progenitor maintenance. It is unlikely that disruption of the yolk sac or angiogenesis contributed to the restriction of cardiac growth because there was no discernable difference in the phenotype of embryos or yolk sacs at E8. 5. Furthermore, the results from somatic mosaicism demonstrated that Numb/Numbl DKO CPCs were unable to proliferate in normal PA2 environment, suggesting a cell-autonomous role of Numb and Numbl. Curiously, the deletion of Numb and Numbl in CPCs appears to affect the growth of neighboring PA2 cells as well. This suggests that Numb and Numbl may also influence CPC renewal and expansion by regulating PA2 development in a non-cell autonomous manner. Numb and Numbl may affect CPC renewal and expansion via Notch, a conserved transmembrane receptor, given that Numb and Notch are mutually antagonistic( Schweisguth, 2004). In fact, Notch1 deficiency causes CPC expansion in the OT( Kwon et al., 2009). The expansion of CPCs is at least in part mediated by accumulation of the Wnt signaling effector β-catenin that are negatively regulated by membrane Notch( Kwon et al., 2011). Membrane Notch appears to require Numb and Numbl for the negative regulation of β-catenin( Kwon et al., 2011; Andersen et al., 2012), suggesting Numb and Numbl may be essential regulators of Notch and Wnt signaling during CPC development. With our current study, it will be necessary to re-examine the roles of Notch and Wnt signals at the level of renewing CPCs in the PA2.","answer":"Human embryos contain cells called ‘cardiac progenitor cells’ that serve as the building blocks to make the heart .

They were hypothesized to originate from embryonic progenitor cells that acquire long-term self-renewal ability and multipotency at the end of organogenesis. The process through which this is achieved often remains unclear. Here, we discovered that long-term hair follicle stem cells arise from embryonic progenitor cells occupying a niche location that is defined by attenuated Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Hair follicle initiation is marked by placode formation, which depends on the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Soon afterwards, a region with attenuated Wnt/β-catenin signaling emerges in the upper follicle. Embryonic progenitor cells residing in this region gain expression of adult stem cell markers and become definitive long-term hair follicle stem cells at the end of organogenesis. Attenuation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a prerequisite for hair follicle stem cell specification because it suppresses Sox9, which is required for stem cell formation.Introduction:Long-term adult stem cells( SCs) are defined by their ability to continuously generate all downstream differentiated cell lineages as well as regenerate themselves throughout the lifetime of an organism( Fuchs and Chen, 2013). Although rudimentary tissue progenitor cells in embryos give rise to all cells in adult tissue, these cells are not SCs, because they are destined to change identity as development proceeds. It has been postulated that definitive tissue SCs originate from tissue embryonic progenitor cells that acquire the capacity for long-term self-renewal and multipotency at the end of organogenesis( Slack, 2008). However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of these processes remain unknown. Deciphering the process leading to localized SC emergence during normal embryonic development will likely reveal principles that can be used to acquire and maintain the long-term self-renewal and regenerative potentials that are prerequisites for SC-based therapies. Adult SCs in hair follicles( HFs) are located at the so-called ‘outer bulge region’. The bulge region constitutes the bottom of the permanent portion of a HF. It contains two layers of epithelial cells: the CD34- inner layer niche cells and the CD34+ outer layer stem cells. Although HFs begin to develop in the embryo, the bulge structure is only formed when HFs enter the first postnatal telogen( resting phase); this delineates the end of organogenesis and the emergence of the adult SC niche( Paus et al., 1999; Morris et al., 2004; Tumbar et al., 2004; Blanpain et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2009; Hsu et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2012). Initiation of HF organogenesis is marked by placode emergence. Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in basal epithelial cells by locally expressed Wnt ligands is both necessary and sufficient to induce placode formation( van Genderen et al., 1994; Gat et al., 1998; Huelsken et al., 2001; Andl et al., 2002; Jamora et al., 2003; Millar et al., 1999; Reddy et al., 2001; Fu and Hsu, 2013). Concomitant with Wnt ligand production, placode epithelial cells also express the Wnt inhibitor Dkk( Bazzi et al., 2007). The combination of the short-range activator Wnt and the long-range inhibitor DKK function in a reaction-diffusion mechanism to suppress Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cells surrounding existing placodes, thereby regulating HF spacing( Sick et al., 2006). Contrary to the required activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, inhibition of BMP signaling through the dermal BMP inhibitor Noggin is necessary for placode morphogenesis( Jamora et al., 2003; Botchkarev et al., 1999; Kobielak et al., 2003). After placode formation, signaling events downstream of Wnts/BMPs drive HF to further develop into the hair germ and then the hair peg. Shh is expressed by placode epithelial cells( Oro et al., 1997; St-Jacques et al., 1998; Morgan et al., 1998). In the absence of Shh, dermal condensate fails to aggregate and HF development arrests at the placode stage instead of developing into the hair germ. This implicates Shh in establishing proper epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk( St-Jacques et al., 1998; Oro and Higgins, 2003; Levy et al., 2007). Guard hairs, as the first HFs to appear in the embryonic backskin, are uniquely dependent on Eda/EdaR signaling( Laurikkala et al., 2002; Mustonen et al., 2004). Eda, which is itself a Wnt signaling target( Laurikkala et al., 2001), can induce the expression of BMP inhibitors and Shh in guard hair( Pummila et al., 2007). Placode progenitor cells generate all cells in adult HFs( Levy et al., 2007). Some of their progeny cease further development at a particular point and become definitive adult HFSCs. Previous studies using label-retaining methods demonstrated that putative HFSCs are present in postnatal developing HFs as slow cycling cells, and it was shown that their specification requires the transcription factor Sox9( Nowak et al., 2008). Intriguingly, placode cells already express adult HFSC markers such as Lhx2 and Sox9, although in a largely non-overlapping pattern. Another HFSC marker, Nfatc1, appears in the subsequent hair peg( Rhee et al., 2006; Horsley et al., 2008; Vidal et al., 2005). These dynamic expression patterns suggest that cells in the placode and hair peg are heterogeneous. However, whether or not HFSC fate is already pre-determined at these early developmental stages is not clear. Other critical unanswered questions include the following: Are adult HFSCs remnant of embryonic progenitor cells that maintain their embryonic developmental potential, or do they, alternatively, come from progenitor cells that gain long-term potential? What are the underlying mechanisms? What determines the niche location and where do HFSCs become localized? The current study addresses these key questions.Discussion:Our study elucidates the cascade of events that lead to long-term SC emergence in HFs during organogenesis( Figure 7). Wnt/β-catenin signaling is necessary for HF initiation( Andl et al., 2002; Ito et al., 2007). Early placode cells are Wnt/β-catenin signal responsive cells, and they generate all of the cells in adult HFs. At the hair peg stage, a localized Wnt/β-catenin signaling free zone emerges in upper HF. Progenitor cells residing in this embryonic niche position stop further development and become HFSCs at the end of organogenesis. These established HFSC precursor cells are not just remnants of embryonic progenitor cells, because they gain the expression of adult HFSC markers including Nfatc1. Embryonic cells residing in this Wnt/β-catenin signaling free zone, together with a few other cells located below them that have active Wnt/β-catenin signaling, give rise to the adult HFSC pool. However, only the HFSCs derived from Wnt/β-catenin signaling negative precursor cells have long-term self-renewal ability and can continuously support regeneration. The small portion of HFSCs that are derived from embryonic cells with active Wnt/β-catenin signaling are highly prone to differentiation as the hair cycle progresses and are soon exhausted after regeneration. So, in embryos, the attenuation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling not only defines the adult niche position and HFSC fate, but also has a long lasting effect on the subsequent fate choice and long-term potential of cells in adults. 10. 7554/eLife. 10567. 016Figure 7. Model illustrating that long-term hair follicle stem cell emergence results from progenitors occupying an embryonic niche location, which is defined by the absence of Wnt/β-catenin signaling that would otherwise block the expression of a key factor required for stem cell specification. DOI: http://dx. doi. org/10. 7554/eLife. 10567. 016 It’s noteworthy that we observed largely none overlapping labeling patterns of Lgr5+ and Axin2+ cells in hair peg( Figure 6B, Figure 6—figure supplement 1B). Also, Lgr5+ hair peg cells contributed HFSCs persist after multiple hair cycles instead of completely diminishing like Axin2+ cells contributed HFSCs( Figure 6—figure supplement 1). These results indicate it is possible that in hair follicle Lgr5 expression either reflects very low level of Wnt signaling, or it is induced by a different set of Wnt ligands than those induce Axin2. Although we were able to pinpoint the main mechanism through which Wnt/β-catenin signaling blocks long-term HFSC formation, i. e. the suppression of Sox9 expression, we suspect that this might not be the only mechanism involved in this process. It has been reported previously that Sox9 expression is induced by Shh signaling( Vidal et al., 2005). Given that we observed extended activity of Shh signaling throughout follicle epithelial cells and observed only localized activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in lower follicle cells, we can explain the mutually exclusive pattern of Sox9+ and Wnt/β-catenin signaling responsive cells. As development proceeds, the Sox9 expression pattern continues to expand and become wider than the actual future bulge region; for example, Sox9 is expressed in most of the ORS cells. So, following the emergence of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling free zone in the hair peg, there are probably other mechanisms that help maintain the restricted niche position. One observation further supporting this hypothesis is that, once initiated in hair peg, the expression of Nfatc1 is restricted to the upper HF where the future sebaceous gland and bulge will be; Nfatc1 expression does not expand to the broader ORS like Sox9 expression does. Nfatc1 was reported to be a target of BMP signaling in adult HFs( Horsley et al., 2008). However, we did not observe active BMP signaling at the hair peg niche location using a BMP reporter, a result similar to a published staining pattern of pSMAD1/5 in developing HFs( Kandyba et al., 2014). So, it remains to be determined which, if any, other mechanisms lead to the maintenance of a more restricted niche region that is reflected by the localized expression of stem cell markers. Since attenuated Wnt/β-catenin signaling defines the niche location and long-term HFSC fate, the process of exactly how the Wnt/β-catenin signaling free zone emerges is of great interest. We observed increased expression of Wnt inhibitors such as SFRPs in Nfatc1+ hair peg cells as compared to Shh+ hair peg cells. However, given that HFSC precursor cells can be replaced by embryonic cells occupying the same hair peg niche position, it is unlikely that Wnt inhibitors expressed by the precursor cells themselves are the main causes of attenuated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in that position. Our RNA seq analysis revealed enrichment of Wnt and Dkk expression in Wnt/β-catenin signal positive Shh+ hair peg cells as compared to Nfatc1+ hair peg cells. We hypothesize that the combination of the lack of Wnt ligands, which are short-range signal molecules, and the presence of Wnt inhibitors such as DKK4, which are long-range signal molecules, at the embryonic niche location is the main reason contributes to the emergence of a Wnt/β-catenin signaling free zone in upper hair peg. A similar model has been used to explain HF density determination and epidermal SC regulation( Sick et al., 2006; Lim et al., 2013). To directly test the suppositions of this hypothesis, the protein localization patterns of Wnt and DKK will need to be dissected.","answer":"Many tissues and organs in an adult’s body – including bone marrow , skin and intestines – contain a small number of cells called adult stem cells . These cells usually stay dormant within these tissues ( at a site called a ‘niche’ ) until they are required to repair damaged or lost cells . At this point , adult stem cells can specialize , or ‘differentiate’ , into the many different cell types that make up the tissue or organ where they reside . The cells that produce hairs are an example of adult stem cells . In mammals , hairs grow from structures called hair follicles that are found in the skin , and over the life of an animal , old hairs are shed and replaced . Previous research had suggested that certain embryonic cells are set to become hair follicle stem cells before the hair follicles emerge in the adult tissue . However it remained unclear how this decision is made , and which genes and molecules are involved in this process . Xu et al . have now found that , in mice , the fate of hair follicle stem cells is decided at an early stage in development , when the hair follicle is a simpler structure called a ‘hair peg’ . Cells near the upper part of the hair peg tend to become dormant and adopt an adult stem cell fate , while the ones in the lower part are more likely to differentiate straight away . This shows that the position , hence the niche environment , plays a key role in determining these different cells’ fates . Xu et al . went on to discover that the decision for a cell to become a hair follicle stem cell relies on reduced signaling through the so-called Wnt signal pathway . Understanding how adult stem cells become established during development may help future efforts to grow tissues and organs in the laboratory for research purposes or organ transplantation ."},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

Following exposure of Megalobrama amblycephala to ammonia (0.1 or 20 mg L(-1)), two cDNA libraries were constructed from the fish gills and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000. Over 90 million reads were generated and de novo assembled into 46, 615 unigenes, which were then extensively annotated by comparing to different protein databases, followed by biochemical pathway prediction. The expression of 2666 unigenes significantly differed; 1961 were up-regulated, while 975 were down-regulated. Among these, 250 unigenes were identified as the targets for 10 conserved and 4 putative novel miRNA families by miRNA target computational prediction. We examined expression of ssa-miRNA-21 and its target genes by real-time quantitative PCR and found agreement with the sequencing data. This study demonstrates the feasibility of identifying miRNA targets by transcriptome analysis. The transcriptome assembly data represent a substantial increase in the genomic resources available for Megalobrama amblycephala and will be useful for gene expression profile analysis and miRNA functional annotation.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"target genes\\", \\"fish gills\\", \\"gill\\", \\"genomes\\", \\"cDNA libraries\\", \\"ssa-miRNA-21\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"expression of 2666 unigenes\\", \\"expression\\", \\"down-regulated\\", \\"biochemical pathway\\", \\"up-regulated\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"microRNA\\", \\"miRNA\\", \\"miRNA target\\", \\"miRNA targets\\", \\"microRNAs\\", \\"miRNA families\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"blunt snout bream\\", \\"Megalobrama amblycephala\\"], \\"Finding\\": [], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"gene expression profile analysis\\", \\"transcriptome analysis\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"sequencing data\\", \\"protein databases\\", \\"Illumina HiSeq 2000\\", \\"unigenes\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"feasibility of identifying\\", \\"target gene prediction\\", \\"real-time quantitative PCR\\", \\"miRNA functional annotation\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"transcriptome assembly\\", \\"transcriptome\\", \\"assembly\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

M. Linehan et al., J. Am. Med. Assoc., 273  564-570, 1995; E. A. Maher and W. G. Kaelin, Jr., Medicine (Baltimore), 76  381-391, 1997; W. M. Linehan and R. D. Klausner, In  B. Vogelstein and K. Kinzler (eds.), The Genetic Basis of Human Cancer, pp. 455-473, McGraw-Hill, 1998]. The VHL gene was localized to chromosome 3p25-26 and cloned [F. Latif et al., Science (Washington DC), 260  1317-1320, 1993]. Germline mutations in the VHL gene have been detected in the majority of VHL kindreds. The reported frequency of detection of VHL germline mutations has varied from 39 to 80% (J. M. Whaley et al., Am. J. Hum. Genet., 55  1092-1102, 1994; Clinical Research Group for Japan, Hum. Mol.

Recently a quantitative Southern blotting procedure was found to improve this frequency (C. Stolle et al., Hum. Mutat., 12  417-423, 1998). In the present study, we report the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as a method to detect and characterize VHL germline deletions. We reexamined a group of VHL patients shown previously by single-strand conformation and sequencing analysis not to harbor point mutations in the VHL locus. We found constitutional deletions in 29 of 30 VHL patients in this group using cosmid and P1 probes that cover the VHL locus. We then tested six phenotypically normal offspring from four of these VHL families  two were found to carry the deletion and the other four were deletion-free. In addition, germline mosaicism of the VHL gene was identified in one family. In sum, FISH was found to be a simple and reliable method to detect VHL germline deletions and practically useful in cases where other methods of screening have failed to detect a VHL gene abnormality","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"endolymphatic sac tumors\\", \\"hemangioblastomas\\", \\"epididymal cystadenomas\\", \\"VHL gene abnormality\\", \\"pancreatic cysts and tumors\\", \\"VHL\\", \\"tumor\\", \\"von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease\\", \\"renal cell carcinomas\\", \\"autosomal dominantly inherited cancer syndrome\\", \\"pheochromocytomas\\", \\"von Hippel-Lindau\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers.

Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is an autosomal dominant disorder comprising cleft lip and/or cleft palate and lip pits. We reported previously a family whose underlying mutation is a 500-800 kb deletion localized to chromosome bands 1q32-q41 [Sander et al., 1994  Hum Mol Genet 3  576-578]. Along with cleft lip/palate and lip pits, affected relatives exhibit developmental delays, suggesting that the function of a gene nearby may also be disrupted. To further localize the VWS gene we searched for other deletions that cause VWS. An allele loss assay was performed using a novel highly polymorphic marker, D1S3753. From a panel of 37 unrelated individuals, we detected an allele loss in one family, indicating the presence of a deletion. In this family, the phenotype in three generations of affected individuals was confined to the cardinal signs of VWS. Surprisingly, mapping of the new deletion showed that it extended 0. 2-1 Mb beyond the proximal breakpoint for the deletion described previously. No deletions were detected in seven cases of popliteal pterygia syndrome, 76 cases of mixed syndromic forms of cleft lip and palate, and 178 cases of nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate.","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"lip pits\\", \\"developmental delays\\", \\"VWS\\", \\"cleft lip\\", \\"cleft lip/palate\\", \\"popliteal pterygia syndrome\\", \\"cleft palate\\", \\"nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate\\", \\"autosomal dominant disorder\\", \\"syndromic forms of cleft lip and palate\\", \\"Van der Woude syndrome\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

Inclusion or exclusion of these proteins defines many unique forms of SWI/SNF and has profound functional consequences. Often this complex is studied as a single entity within a particular cell type and we understand little about the functional relationship between these biochemically distinct forms of the remodeling complex. Here we examine the functional relationships among three complex-specific ARID( AT-Rich Interacting Domain) subunits using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation, transcriptome analysis, and transcription factor binding maps. We find widespread overlap in transcriptional regulation and the genomic binding of distinct SWI/SNF complexes. ARID1B and ARID2 participate in wide-spread cooperation to repress hundreds of genes. Additionally, we find numerous examples of competition between ARID1A and another ARID, and validate that gene expression changes following loss of one ARID are dependent on the function of an alternative ARID. These distinct regulatory modalities are correlated with differential occupancy by transcription factors. Together, these data suggest that distinct SWI/SNF complexes dictate gene-specific transcription through functional interactions between the different forms of the SWI/SNF complex and associated co-factors. Most genes regulated by SWI/SNF are controlled by multiple biochemically distinct forms of the complex, and the overall expression of a gene is the product of the interaction between these different SWI/SNF complexes. The three mutually exclusive ARID family members are among the most frequently mutated chromatin regulators in cancer, and understanding the functional interactions and their role in transcriptional regulation provides an important foundation to understand their role in cancer.Introduction:The SWI/SNF( SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable) family of chromatin remodeling proteins plays a critical role in developmental processes[1]. In mice and humans this complex is composed of 12–15 subunits and certain positions within the complex can be filled by distinct mutually exclusive proteins[2, 3]. The inclusion of different subunits gives rise to a functionally diverse set of complexes, capable of driving a cell into a specific lineage or critical for maintaining pluripotency[4–6]. There are a large number of possible forms of the SWI/SNF complex based on the inclusion of such mutually exclusive subunits, and despite the pivotal role for many of these in development and disease the functional relationships between mutually exclusive subunits remains under-explored. The ARID( AT-Rich Interacting Domain) domain containing proteins of the SWI/SNF complex are examples of three mutually exclusive subunits, and their inclusion distinguishes three biochemically distinct forms of SWI/SNF. ARID1A and ARID1B are found in the BAF-A and BAF-B( Brahma Associated Factor) complex respectively, while ARID2 is found in the PBAF( Polybromo BAF) complex. The functional interactions between distinct forms of this heterogeneous remodeling complex have not been studied genome-wide. All three ARID genes are mutated in a wide variety of tumors[7–15]. Of particular interest to our study, all three are recurrently mutated in hepatocellular carcinoma and mutations are mutually exclusive suggesting they function through related mechanisms[10–12]. A current focus of therapeutically targeting SWI/SNF mutant tumors is based on findings of synthetic lethality between subunits, yet we currently understand little about how these subunits functionally interact[16, 17]. In this paper we examine two questions related to the functional overlap of distinct forms of the SWI/SNF remodeling complex. First, do different SWI/SNF complexes extensively cooperate or compete to regulate transcription? Second, do distinct forms of the SWI/SNF complex interact with unique or common cis-regulatory modules to mediate their role in transcription? To address these questions we performed ChIP-seq and RNA-seq in HepG2 cells, a human liver cancer cell line for which extensive transcription factor binding data are available from the ENCODE project[18]. We present evidence that ARID1A, ARID1B, and ARID2 have a highly overlapping role in transcriptional regulation in HepG2 cells. Additionally, we provide the first genome-wide mapping of biochemically distinct SWI/SNF complexes and show a high degree of overlap between binding sites for the different ARID proteins. We identify putative regulatory modules specific for the different types of ARID mediated regulation. Using RNAi against combinations of ARIDs we show ARID1A and ARID2 have frequent competitive interactions, while ARID1B and ARID2 are both required for repression and are not redundant. Our study provides insight into how distinct forms of the SWI/SNF complex regulate transcription in an interdependent manner and provides mechanistic insight into recent observations of synthetic lethal interactions between SWI/SNF subunits[16, 17, 19].Discussion:Chromatin regulating proteins bind throughout the genome and play a critical role in transcriptional regulation. Studies have shown genomic co-localization for many chromatin regulators[26] as well as for different chromatin remodeling families[22]. Loss of appropriate chromatin remodeling can have genome-wide effects on transcription and chromatin structure[30]. Using three mutually exclusive subunits of the SWI/SNF complex we delineate several classes of functional relationships between biochemically distinct forms of this complex. Using RNA-seq and ChIP-seq we classified transcriptional regulation based on the whether a gene was regulated by a single ARID containing complex, or by multiple ARID complexes. Additionally, we classified shared regulatory function based on whether two ARID proteins act concordantly or discordantly to regulate transcription. Using our ChIP-seq data combined with the rich dataset provided by the ENCODE project[18] we were able to identify differences in each of these classes. ARID1B and ARID2 coordinately regulated transcription of a large set of genes. The majority of this overlap was seen in genes cooperatively repressed by ARID1B and ARID2. While SWI/SNF has been shown to function in repression[31–34], no study has previously shown repression mediated through a cooperative function of two distinct SWI/SNF complexes. Depletion of both ARID1B and ARID2 at the same time did not further enhance this de-repression suggesting they function in the same pathway. Many of these targets were also directly bound by ARID1B and ARID2. However, not all of these sites were occupied by both ARID1B and ARID2, which given their cooperative role in transcriptional regulation is surprising. One possibility is the cooperativity reflects a repressive role for each individually at distinct regulatory sites of a gene, and loss of a single ARID is enough to de-repress the locus. Consistent with this ARID1B peaks directly associated with repression tended to be more localized to introns, and non-overlapping with other ARIDs. Understanding how ARID1B and ARID2 mediate these cooperative activities is an important ongoing question. Our study suggests one possible mechanism involves the co-factors recruited to each class of sites. When ARID1B and ARID2 are activating gene expression, these sites appear more commonly located near the transcription start site. Additionally, these sites are occupied by transcriptional activators such as BRCA1 and MAX, both of which have previously been linked to SWI/SNF function[19, 35], but these interactions have not been linked to a specific form of the SWI/SNF complex( Fig 7D). When ARID1B is associated with repression, it either recruits or is recruited by factors such as TEAD4 or TCF7L2( Fig 7D). We cannot at this point determine whether the ARIDs drive recruitment of other factors to these sites or vice versa, although there is precedent for unique co-factors recruiting SWI/SNF to drive tissue specific gene activation[36]. Together this suggests that not only do ARID1B and ARID2 distinguish biochemically distinct forms of SWI/SNF( BAF-B vs PBAF complex), but the combinatorial assembly of SWI/SNF with other transcription factors and co-regulators defines functionally distinct complexes. We identified many examples of competitive interactions amongst the ARID subunits, and validated the mechanistic importance of this competition( Fig 5C). This supports several studies that have shown transcriptional changes at single genes following loss of a SWI/SNF member depend on the remaining complex. The broad overlap we observe in transcriptional regulation( Fig 1A) suggests direct competition is a general mechanism of SWI/SNF regulatory control[4, 5, 20, 37]. Using genes that were altered by both ARID1A and ARID2 depletion, as well as were bound by both ARIDs we identified co-factors mapped by the ENCODE project that were specifically enriched near sites associated with competitive interactions compared to cooperatively regulated genes. We found both transcriptional activators, such as the MYC interacting protein MAZ, as well as a negative regulators, such as COREST at competitively regulating genes. Given the dependence on ARID1A for expression following ARID2 loss, this suggests a mechanism where ARID1A recruits or stabilizes transcriptional activators to the promoter, while ARID2 is necessary for repression( Fig 7D). Our study did not reveal a direct replacement of ARID1A by ARID2 following knockdown. However, this may be related to the difficulty of ChIP for this factors and the broad enrichment peaks. Future work evaluating swapping of biochemically distinct SWI/SNF complexes genome wide using models which allow a complete loss of one complex will shed light on the mechanisms of the different types of regulation we observe. Evidence of a central role for SWI/SNF in oncogenesis comes from the increasing variety of tumors in which the complex is recurrently mutated[14, 38–40]. In some cases loss of specific types of the SWI/SNF complex can be important in the conjunction with misregulation of certain signaling pathways. For example, a synergistic oncogenic event triggered by ARID1A loss and PIK3CA activation leads to ovarian clear cell carcinoma in an animal model[41]. Additionally, in the background of NOTCH-dependent T-ALL, PBAF complexes are required for continued tumor proliferation[42]. Both cases demonstrate an interaction between signaling pathways and chromatin regulation, however in one example, the loss of a SWI/SNF complex is necessary for tumor formation, while in the second a specific SWI/SNF complex is required for continued tumor growth. Finally, some forms of the SWI/SNF complex have been shown to have direct oncogenic effects through their role in transcriptional regulation. In synovial sarcoma a fusion of a SWI/SNF subunit( SS18) to SSX leads to the eviction of SNF5 from the complex and mis-localization of SWI/SNF ultimately resulting in inappropriate activation of a proliferative transcriptional program[43]. These recent mechanistic insights into SWI/SNF mediated mis-regulation in cancer highlight the importance of understanding the functional relationships between the many possible forms of this complex. The idea of therapeutically targeting SWI/SNF, either in the context of other SWI/SNF mutations, or in tumors with specific genetic lesions, is beginning to gain traction[17, 19]. When considering how these synthetic lethalities manifest, it is important to consider how the remaining subunits of SWI/SNF contribute to the overall transcriptional program of a cell. We identify widespread functional interaction between distinct forms of the SWI/SNF complex that in many cases depends on the remaining SWI/SNF in the cell. Given the broad role of SWI/SNF in gene regulation( 21% of genes expressed in HepG2 cells), it is likely that these types of interactions are common to other cell types, and the discovery of more interactions will shed light on the functional relationships within the SWI/SNF complex. The existence of both competitive and cooperative interactions between distinct SWI/SNF complexes provides mechanistic clues into synthetic lethality involving SWI/SNF and is an intriguing opportunity to identify new therapeutic targets specific to mis-regulation of the complex[17, 19].","answer":"The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is made of multiple subunits , and the inclusion of different mutually exclusive subunits allows potentially many biochemically distinct forms of SWI/SNF .

To investigate the extrapolation of these findings to the clinical setting , we conducted a two-year study on 547 schoolchildren in Budapest , Hungary . Subjects in the \\" Gum \\" group were instructed to chew one stick of a commercially available sorbitol-sweetened chewing gum for 20 minutes after meals , three times daily . The \\" Control \\" group was not provided with chewing gum . After two years , the \\" Gum \\" group exhibited a 38.7 % reduction in incremental caries , excluding white spots , compared with the \\" Control \\" group . Including white spots , a corresponding 33.1 % reduction was indicated . These results clearly suggest that even in a moderate caries population practicing normal oral hygiene , including the use of fluoride dentifrices , an after-meal gum-chewing regimen can significantly reduce the rate of caries developmentTitle 2:Influence of Maternal Xylitol Consumption on Acquisition of Mutans Streptococci by InfantsAbstract 2:Xylitol is effective as a non-cariogenic sugar substitute . Habitual xylitol consumption appears to select for mutans streptococci ( MS ) with impaired adhesion properties , i.e. , they shed easily to saliva from plaque . One hundred sixty-nine mother-child pairs participated in a two-year study exploring whether the mothers ' xylitol consumption could be used to prevent mother-child transmission of mutans streptococci . All mothers showed high salivary levels of mutans streptococci during pregnancy . The mothers in the xylitol group ( n = 106 ) were requested to chew xylitol-sweetened gum ( 65 % w/w ) at least 2 or 3 times a day , starting three months after delivery . In the two control groups , the mothers received either chlorhexidine ( n = 30 ) or fluoride ( n = 33 ) varnish treatments at 6 , 12 , and 18 months after delivery . The children did not chew gum or receive varnish treatments . MS were assessed from the mothers ' saliva at half-year intervals and from the children 's plaque at the one- and two-year examinations . The MS were cultured on Mitis salivarius agars containing bacitracin . The salivary MS levels of the mothers remained high and not significantly different among the three study groups throughout the study . At two years of age , 9.7 % of the children in the xylitol , 28.6 % in the chlorhexidine , and 48.5 % in the fluoride varnish group showed a detectable level of MS . In conclusion , therefore , habitual xylitol  consumption by mothers was associated with a statistically significant reduction of the probability of mother-child transmission of MS assessed at two years of age . The effect was superior to that obtained with either chlorhexidine or fluoride varnish treatments performed as single applications at six-month intervals","answer":"Polyols like maltitol and sorbitol are by no means inert and are thus not valid controls for xylitol .Xylitol has beneficial effects on the oral flora not shared by other polyols .The evidence so far supports specific xylitol-effects on oral bacteria , but not on saliva .Xylitol can not be metabolized by plaque bacteria , contrary to sorbitol and other 6-carbon polyols , and may thus favour mineralization .Some authors have cl aim ed that the beneficial effects of xylitol are solely based on saliva stimulation and that all sugar-free gums are similar in this respect .In fact , in conditions where caries occurrence is high , even sorbitol gum can prevent caries.8 A recent study elegantly shows caries prevention with xylitol without any saliva stimulation .Though strict inclusion criteria prevent conclusions based on systematic review s of the literature , evidence -based treatment guidelines can still be given for the use of xylitol .Xylitol is a useful adjunct to traditional methods for caries control and prevention ."},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

The authors tested a population-based medical care management intervention designed to improve primary medical care in community mental health settings.                A total of 407 subjects with severe mental illness at an urban community mental health center were randomly assigned to either the medical care management intervention or usual care. For individuals in the intervention group, care managers provided communication and advocacy with medical providers, health education, and support in overcoming system-level fragmentation and barriers to primary medical care.                At a 12-month follow-up evaluation, the intervention group received an average of 58.7% of recommended preventive services compared with a rate of 21.8% in the usual care group. They also received a significantly higher proportion of evidence-based services for cardiometabolic conditions (34.9% versus 27.7%) and were more likely to have a primary care provider (71.2% versus 51.9%). The intervention group showed significant improvement on the SF-36 mental component summary (8.0% [versus a 1.1% decline in the usual care group]) and a nonsignificant improvement on the SF-36 physical component summary. Among subjects with available laboratory data, scores on the Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Index were significantly better in the intervention group (6.9%) than the usual care group (9.8%).                Medical care management was associated with significant improvements in the quality and outcomes of primary care. These findings suggest that care management is a promising approach for improving medical care for patients treated in community mental health settings.Title 2:Physical health--a cluster randomized controlled lifestyle intervention among persons with a psychiatric disability and their staff.Abstract 2:The objective was to explore the impact on physical health of a lifestyle programme among persons with psychiatric disabilities, and their caregivers. Their satisfaction with the intervention was also assessed. Somatic comorbidity and an increased mortality related to the lifestyle among persons with psychiatric disabilities are well known. Few randomized controlled trials have been aimed specifically at lifestyle issues among persons with a psychiatric disability. This trial includes clients with psychiatric disabilities living in supported housing and their staff. Forty-one persons with a DSM-?V diagnosis of severe mental illness from psychiatric disability from 10 supported housing facilities and 41 of their caregivers participated in this 12-month study during 2005-2006 in Sweden. The supported housing facilities with residents and staff were randomly assigned to either a health intervention programme or a control programme with an aesthetic content. The presence of metabolic syndrome and changes in the mean of physiological parameters such as Hba1c, P-glucose, P-insulin, lipids, blood pressure, physical working capacity, body mass index, Heart Score were investigated and participants' satisfaction assessed. There was a significant reduction in the mean of metabolic syndrome criteria in the intervention group compared with the control group at the follow-up. The participants expressed satisfaction with the programme. The results indicate that health interventions on lifestyle issues when involving carers are appreciated, feasible and could be successful in reducing some health-related risk factors among persons with psychiatric disabilities.Title 3:Clinical trial of wellness training: health promotion for severely mentally ill adults.Abstract 3:This randomized controlled trial examined benefits of adding active health promotion to basic primary care (BPC) services for SMI adults. It compared BPC with BPC plus wellness training (WT), a 12 months intervention promoting individual skills in self-management. Three hundred nine participants enrolled during short-term residential treatment completed baseline assessments and were assigned to treatment groups, before discharge. Outcomes of perceived health status (SF-36), global assessment of function, and ratings of self-efficacy were assessed at follow-up interviews at 6, 12, and 18 months. The intent-to-treat analysis employed multilevel regression to examine differences by group on outcomes across time, controlling for health related covariates. The WT group showed significantly better outcomes on the SF-36 physical functioning and general health scales. Findings affirm ability of SMI adults to benefit from active health promotion.","answer":"General physical health could lead to people with serious mental illness accessing more health services which, in turn, could mean they see longer term benefits such as reduced mortality or morbidity. On the other hand it is possible clinicians are expending much effort, time and financial expenditure on giving ineffective advice. This is an important area for good research reporting outcome of interest to carers and people with serious illnesses as well as researchers and fundholders.Note: the 43 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  To train a statistical spoken dialogue system (SDS) it is essential that an accurate method for measuring task success is available. To date training has relied on presenting a task to either simulated or paid users and inferring the dialogue's success by observing whether this presented task was achieved or not. Our aim however is to be able to learn from real users acting under their own volition, in which case it is non-trivial to rate the success as any prior knowledge of the task is simply unavailable. User feedback may be utilised but has been found to be inconsistent. Hence, here we present two neural network models that evaluate a sequence of turn-level features to rate the success of a dialogue. Importantly these models make no use of any prior knowledge of the user's task. The models are trained on dialogues generated by a simulated user and the best model is then used to train a policy on-line which is shown to perform at least as well as a baseline system using prior knowledge of the user's task. We note that the models should also be of interest for evaluating SDS and for monitoring a dialogue in rule-based SDS. 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  We investigate evaluation metrics for dialogue response generation systems where supervised labels, such as task completion, are not available. Recent works in response generation have adopted metrics from machine translation to compare a model's generated response to a single target response. We show that these metrics correlate very weakly with human judgements in the non-technical Twitter domain, and not at all in the technical Ubuntu domain. We provide quantitative and qualitative results highlighting specific weaknesses in existing metrics, and provide recommendations for future development of better automatic evaluation metrics for dialogue systems.Literature Review:","answer":"Evaluating the quality of the generated response is an important aspect of dialogue response generation systems BIB003 .

Human populations in the rapidly urbanizing cities of the developing world require access to vegetables, fruits, meat, etc. typically produced elsewhere. As theorized by von Thünen in 1826 [34] , much of this demand is met by farms near cities [35] , many in areas undergoing processes of peri-urbanization [26] . Due to the globalization of poultry trade, large-scale chicken farms raising thousands of birds have expanded rapidly in Southeast Asia and compete with existing small backyard farmers [36] . Large, enterprise-scale (15,000-100,000 birds) operations are still rare in Viet Nam (only 33 communes have such a facility). On the other hand, domestic and multinational companies frequently contract farmers to raise between 2,000 and 15,000 birds. Recent studies have examined the relative role of extensive (backyard) systems and intensive systems [15, [17] [18] [19] 37] . In much of Asia there is often a mix of commercial and backyard farming at any one location [36] . Experts have suggested that from a biosecurity perspective the co-location of extensive and intensive systems is a potential risk factor [38] . Intensive systems allow for virus evolution (e.g. Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza to HPAI) and transformation, while extensive systems allow for environmental persistence and circulation [39] . Previous studies of chicken populations as a risk factor have distinguished between production systems-native chickens, backyard chickens; flock density; commercial chickens, broilers and layers density, etc. [15, [17] [18] [19] 37] . In isolation, however, none of these number and/or density based poultry metrics adequately measures the extent of co-location of intensive and extensive systems in any given place. Intensive and extensive systems in Viet Nam have their own fairly well defined flock sizes. A diversity index of the relative number of intensive and extensive systems of poultry-raising can better estimate the effect of such co-location; this study attempts to link a livestock diversity index with the presence or absence of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks at the commune level. This study investigated for the 10,820 communes of Viet Nam a wide suite of socio-economic, agricultural, climatic and ecological variables relevant to poultry management and the transmission and persistence of the HPAI virus. Many of these variables were identified based on earlier studies of HPAI (as reviewed in Gilbert and Pfeiffer [40] ). Three novel variables were included based on hypotheses generated by this project. All variables were measured or aggregated to the commune level. The novel variables were:• Degree of urbanization: We used the urbanicity classification developed by Saksena et al. [9] to define the urban character of each commune. The classification framework is based on four characteristics: 1) percentage of households whose main income is from agriculture, aquaculture and forestry, 2) percentage of households with modern forms of toilets, 3) percentage of land under agriculture, aquaculture and forestry and 4) the Normalized Differentiated Vegetation Index (NDVI). The three-way classification enabled testing for non-linear and non-monotonous responses. • Land-use diversity: We measured land-use diversity using the Gini-Simpson Diversity Index [41] . The Gini-Simpson Diversity Index is given by 1-λ, where λ equals the probability that two entities taken at random from the dataset of interest represent the same type. In situations with only one class (complete homogeneity) the Gini-Simpson index would have a value equal to zero. Such diversity indices have been used to measure land-use diversity [42] . We used the following five land-use classes: annual crops, perennial crops, forests, aquaculture and built-up land (including miscellaneous uses) for which data were collected in the 2006 Agricultural Census. The area under the last class was calculated as the difference between the total area and the sum of the first four classes. The following variables are listed according to their role in disease introduction, transmission and persistence, though some of these factors may have multiple roles. • Human population related transmission. Human population density [11, 14-16, 18, 19, 44, 45] . • Poultry trade and market. Towns and cities were assumed to be active trading places [10, 18, 37, 44, 46] . So, the distance to the nearest town/city was used as indicator of poultry trade. Trade is facilitated by access to transportation infrastructure [37, 47, 48] . So, the distance to the nearest a) national highway and b) provincial highway was used as indicator of transportation infrastructure. • Disease introduction and amplification. The densities of chicken were calculated based on commune area [15, 19, 37, 49] . • Intermediate hosts. Duck and geese densities were calculated using total commune area [11, 19, 49] . As previous studies have shown a link between scavenging in rice fields by ducks and outbreaks, we also calculated duck density using only the area under rice. • Agro-ecological and environmental risk factors. Previous studies have shown that the extent of rice cultivation is a risk factor, mainly due its association with free ranging ducks acting as scavengers [10] . We used percentage of land under rice cultivation as a measure of extent. Rice cropping intensity is also a known risk factor [11, 17, 37] . We used the mean number of rice crops per year as a measure of intensity. The extent of aquaculture is a known risk factor [10] , possibly because water bodies offer routes for transmission and persistence of the virus. The percentage of land under aquaculture was used as a metric. Proximity to water bodies increases the risk of outbreaks [47, [50] [51] [52] , possibly by increasing the chance of contact between wild water birds and domestic poultry.  We measured the distance between the commune and the nearest: a) lake and b) river. Climatic variables-annual mean temperature and annual precipitation-have been associated with significant changes in risk [48, 53] . Elevation, which is associated with types of land cover and agriculture, has been shown to be a significant risk factor in Vietnam [10] . Compound Topographical Index (CTI, also known as Topographical Wetness Index) is a measure of the tendency for water to pool. Studies in Thailand and elsewhere [54] have shown that the extent of surface water is a strong risk factor, possibly due to the role of water in long-range transmission and persistence of the virus. In the absence of reliable and inexpensive data on the extent of surface water we used CTI as a proxy. CTI has been used in Ecological Niche Models (ENM) of HPAI H5N1 [55, 56] . However, given the nature of ENM studies, the effect of CTI as a risk factor has been unknown so far. CTI has been used as a risk factor in the study of other infectious and non-infectious diseases [57] . Some studies have shown that at local scales, the slope of the terrain (a component of CTI) was significantly correlated with reservoir species dominance [58] . CTI is a function of both the slope and the upstream contributing area per unit width orthogonal to the flow direction. CTI is computed as follows: CTI = ln (A s / (tan (β)) where; A s = Area Value calculated as ((flow accumulation + 1) Ã (pixel area in m 2 )) and β is the slope expressed in radians [59] . Though previous studies have indicated that Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a risk factor [10, 20, 55, 60, 61], we did not include it explicitly in our models, as the urban classification index we used included NDVI [9] . We obtained commune level data on HPAI H5N1 outbreaks from the publicly available database of the Department of Animal Health [10] . Viet Nam experienced its first major epidemic waves between December 2003 and February 2006 [10] . We chose to study the first wave (Wave 1) that ended in February 2004 and the second wave (Wave 2) that occurred between December 2004 and April 2005. In Wave 1, 21% of the communes and in Wave 2, 6% of the communes experienced outbreaks. We used data from the 1999 Population Census of Viet Nam to estimate human population per commune. We relied on data from two Agriculture Censuses of Viet Nam. This survey is conducted every five years covering all rural households and those peri-urban households that own farms. Thus about three-fourths of all of the country's households are included. The contents of the survey include number of households in major production activities, population, labor classified by sex, age, qualification, employment and major income source; agriculture, forestry and aquaculture land used by households classified by source, type, cultivation area for by crop type; and farming equipment by purpose. Commune level surveys include information on rural infrastructure, namely electricity, transportation, medical stations, schools; fresh water source, communication, markets, etc. Detailed economic data are collected for large farms. We used the 2006 Agriculture Census for most variables because the first three epidemic waves occurred between the Agricultural Censuses of 2001 and 2006 but were closer in time to the 2006 census [10] . However, for data on poultry numbers we used the 2001 Agriculture Census data set because between 1991 and 2003 the poultry population grew at an average rate of 7% annually. However, in 2004, after the first wave of the H5N1 epidemic, the poultry population fell 15%. Only by mid-2008 did the poultry population return close to pre-epidemic levels. Thus, we considered the poultry population data from the 2001 census to be more representative. We aggregated census household data to the commune level. A three-way classification of the rural-to-urban transition was based on a related study [9] . Raster data on annual mean temperature and precipitation were obtained from the World-Clim database and converted to commune level data. The bioclimatic variables were compiled from the monthly temperature and precipitation values and interpolated to surfaces at 90m spatial resolution [62] . This public database provides data on the average climatic conditions of the period 1950-2000. Elevation was generated from SRTM 90 meter Digital Elevation Models (DEM) acquired from the Consortium for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI). Compound Topographical Index (CTI) data were generated using the Geomorphometry and Gradient Metrics Toolbox for Arc-GIS 10.1. Prior to risk factor analysis we cleaned the data by identifying illogical values for all variables and then either assigning a missing value to them or adjusting the values. Illogical values occurred mainly (less than 1% of the cases) for land-related variables such as percentage of commune land under a particular type of land use. Next we tested each variable for normality using the BestFit software (Palisade Corporation). Most of the variables were found to follow a log-normal distribution and a log-transform was used on them. We then examined the bi-variate correlations between all the risk factors (or their log-transform, as the case may be). Correlations were analyzed separately for each place. Certain risk factors were then eliminated from consideration when |r| ! 0.5 (r is the Pearson correlation coefficient). When two risk factors were highly correlated, we chose to include the one which had not been adequately studied explicitly in previously published risk models. Notably, we excluded a) elevation (correlated with human population density, chicken density, duck density, percentage land under paddy, annual temperature and compound topographical index), b) human population density (correlated with elevation and CTI), c) chicken density (only at national level, correlated with CTI), d) duck and goose density (correlated with elevation, chicken density, percentage land under paddy, land use diversity index and CTI), e) annual temperature (correlated with elevation and CTI) and f) cropping intensity (correlated with percentage land under paddy). Considering the importance of spatial autocorrelation in such epidemics, we used two modeling approaches: 1) multi-level Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) and 2) Boosted Regression trees (BRT) [63, 64] with an autoregressive term [65] . GLMM is a 'place' oriented approach that is well suited to analyzing the effect of administrative groupings, while BRT is a 'space' oriented approach that accounts for the effects of physical proximity. We began by deriving an autoregressive term by averaging the presence/absence among a set of neighbors defined by the limit of autocorrelation, weighted by the inverse of the Euclidean distance [65] . The limit of the autocorrelation of the response variable was obtained from the range of the spatial correlogram ρ (h) [66] . To determine which predictor variables to include in the two models, we conducted logistic regression modeling separately for each of them one by one but included the autoregressive term each time. We finally included only those variables whose coefficient had a significance value p 0.2 (in at least one wave-place combination) and we noted the sign of the coefficient. This choice of p value for screening risk factors is common in similar studies [15, 18, 45, 67] . We used a two-level GLMM (communes nested under districts) to take account of random effects for an area influenced by its neighbors, and thus, we studied the effect of spatial autocorrelation. We used robust standard errors for tests of fixed effects. Boosted regression trees, also known as stochastic gradient boosting, was performed to predict the probability of HPAI H5N1 occurrence and determine the relative influence of each risk factor to the HPAI H5N1 occurrence. This method was developed recently and applied widely for distribution prediction in various fields of ecology [63, 64] . It is widely used for species distribution modeling where only the sites of occurrence of the species are known [68] . The method has been applied in numerous studies for predicting the distribution of HPAI H5N1 disease [16, 51, [69] [70] [71] . BRT utilizes regression trees and boosting algorithms to fit several models and combines them for improving prediction by performing iterative loop throughout the model [63, 64] . The advantage of BRT is that it applies stochastic processes that include probabilistic components to improve predictive performance. We used regression trees to select relevant predictor variables and boosting to improve accuracy in a single tree. The sequential process allows trees to be fitted iteratively through a forward stage-wise procedure in the boosting model. Two important parameters specified in the BRT model are learning rate (lr) and tree complexity (tc) to determine the number of trees for optimal prediction [63, 64] . In our model we used 10 sets of training and test points for cross-validation, a tree complexity of 5, a learning rate of 0.01, and a bag fraction of 0.5. Other advantages of BRT include its insensitivity to co-linearity and non-linear responses. However, for the sake of consistency with the GLMM method, we chose to eliminate predictors that were highly correlated with other predictors and to make log-transforms where needed. In the GLMM models we used p 0.05 to identify significant risk factors. The predictive performances of the models were assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curve.Question: What is the relationship between proximity ofwater bodies to agricultural lands and spread of H5N1 like diseases?","answer":"Proximity to water bodies increases the risk of outbreaks [47, [50] [51] [52] , possibly by increasing the chance of contact between wild water birds and domestic poultry."},{"question":"You will be shown sections from a scientific research paper, together with a question about the paper.

We argue that one of the main reasons that current approaches do not perform well, is that the information is represented sub-optimally. A natural way to describe what we observe, is through natural language. In this paper, we implement a natural language state representation to learn and complete tasks. Our experiments suggest that natural language based agents are more robust, converge faster and perform better than vision based agents, showing the benefit of using natural language representations for Reinforcement Learning.Preliminaries ::: Deep Learning for NLPA word embedding is a mapping from a word w to a vector mathbf {w} in mathbb {R}^d. A simple form of word embedding is the Bag of Words (BoW), a vector mathbf {w} in mathbb {N}^{|D|} (|D| is the dictionary size), in which each word receives a unique 1-hot vector representation. Recently, more efficient methods have been proposed, in which the embedding vector is smaller than the dictionary size, d ll |D|. These methods are also known as distributional embeddings.The distributional hypothesis in linguistics is derived from the semantic theory of language usage (i.e. words that are used and occur in the same contexts tend to have similar meanings). Distributional word representations are a fundamental building block for representing natural language sentences. Word embeddings such as Word2vec BIBREF20 and GloVe BIBREF21 build upon the distributional hypothesis, improving efficiency of state-of-the-art language models.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), originally invented for computer vision, have been shown to achieve strong performance on text classification tasks BIBREF22, BIBREF23, as well as other traditional NLP tasks BIBREF24. In this paper we consider a common architecture BIBREF25, in which each word in a sentence is represented as an embedding vector, a single convolutional layer with m filters is applied, producing an m-dimensional vector for each n-gram. The vectors are combined using max-pooling followed by a ReLU activation. The result is then passed through multiple hidden linear layers with ReLU activation, eventually generating the final output.Semantic State Representations in the Doom Environment ::: ExperimentsWe tested the natural language representation against the visual-based and feature representations on several tasks, with varying difficulty. In these tasks, the agent could navigate, shoot, and collect items such as weapons and medipacks. Often, enemies of different types attacked the agent, and a positive reward was given when an enemy was killed. Occasionally, the agent also suffered from health degeneration. The tasks included a basic scenario, a health gathering scenario, a scenario in which the agent must take cover from fireballs, a scenario in which the agent must defend itself from charging enemies, and a super scenario, where a mixture of the above scenarios was designed to challenge the agent.More specifically, in the basic scenario, a single monster is spawned in front of the agent. The purpose of this scenario is to teach the agent to aim at the enemy and shoot at it. In the health gathering scenario, the floor of the room is covered in toxin, causing the agent to gradually lose health. Medipacks are spawned randomly in the room and the agent's objective is to keep itself alive by collecting them. In the take cover scenario, multiple fireball shooting monsters are spawned in front of the agent. The goal of the agent is to stay alive as long as possible, dodging inbound fireballs. The difficulty of the task increases over time, as additional monsters are spawned. In the defend the center scenario, melee attacking monsters are randomly spawned in the room, and charge towards the agent. As opposed to other scenarios, the agent is incapable of moving, aside from turning left and right and shooting. In the defend the line scenario, both melee and fireball shooting monsters are spawned near the opposing wall. The agent can only step right, left or shoot. Finally, in the “super\\" scenario both melee and fireball shooting monsters are repeatably spawned all over the room. the room contains various items the agent can pick up and use, such as medipacks, shotguns, ammunition and armor. Furthermore, the room is filled with unusable objects, various types of trees, pillars and other decorations. The agent can freely move and turn in any direction, as well as shoot. This scenario combines elements from all of the previous scenarios.Our agent was implemented using a Convolutional Neural Network as described in Section SECREF4. We converted the parsed state into embedded representations of fixed length. We tested both a DQN and a PPO based agent, and compared the natural language representation to the other representation techniques, namely the raw image, feature vector, and semantic segmentation representations.In order to effectively compare the performance of the different representation methods, we conducted our experiments under similar conditions for all agents. The same hyper-parameters were used under all tested representations. Moreover, to rule out effects of architectural expressiveness, the number of weights in all neural networks was approximately matched, regardless of the input type. Finally, we ensured the “super\\" scenario was positively biased toward image-based representations. This was done by adding a large amount items to the game level, thereby filling the state with nuisances (these tests are denoted by \`nuisance' in the scenario name). This was especially evident in the NLP representations, as sentences became extensively longer (average of over 250 words). This is contrary to image-based representations, which did not change in dimension.Results of the DQN-based agent are presented in fig: scenario comparison. Each plot depicts the average reward (across 5 seeds) of all representations methods. It can be seen that the NLP representation outperforms the other methods. This is contrary to the fact that it contains the same information as the semantic segmentation maps. More interestingly, comparing the vision-based and feature-based representations render inconsistent conclusions with respect to their relative performance. NLP representations remain robust to changes in the environment as well as task-nuisances in the state. As depicted in fig: nuisance scenarios, inflating the state space with task-nuisances impairs the performance of all representations. There, a large amount of unnecessary objects were spawned in the level, increasing the state's description length to over 250 words, whilst retaining the same amount of useful information. Nevertheless, the NLP representation outperformed the vision and feature based representations, with high robustness to the applied noise.In order to verify the performance of the natural language representation was not due to extensive discretization of patches, we've conducted experiments increasing the number of horizontal patches - ranging from 3 to 31 patches in the extreme case. Our results, as depicted in fig: patch count, indicate that the amount of discretization of patches did not affect the performance of the NLP agent, remaining a superior representation compared to the rest.To conclude, our experiments suggest that NLP representations, though they describe the same raw information of the semantic segmentation maps, are more robust to task-nuisances, allow for better transfer, and achieve higher performance in complex tasks, even when their description is long and convoluted. While we've only presented results for DQN agents, we include plots for a PPO agent in the Appendix, showing similar trends and conclusions. We thus deduce that NLP-based semantic state representations are a preferable choice for training VizDoom agents.Related WorkWork on representation learning is concerned with finding an appropriate representation of data in order to perform a machine learning task BIBREF33. In particular, deep learning exploits this concept by its very nature BIBREF2. Work on representation learning include Predictive State Representations (PSR) BIBREF34, BIBREF35, which capture the state as a vector of predictions of future outcomes, and a Heuristic Embedding of Markov Processes (HEMP) BIBREF36, which learns to embed transition probabilities using an energy-based optimization problem.There has been extensive work attempting to use natural language in RL. Efforts that integrate language in RL develop tools, approaches, and insights that are valuable for improving the generalization and sample efficiency of learning agents. Previous work on language-conditioned RL has considered the use of natural language in the observation and action space. Environments such as Zork and TextWorld BIBREF37 have been the standard benchmarks for testing text-based games. Nevertheless, these environments do not search for semantic state representations, in which an RL algorithm can be better evaluated and controlled.BIBREF38 use high-level semantic abstractions of documents in a representation to facilitate relational learning using Inductive Logic Programming and a generative language model. BIBREF39 use high-level guidance expressed in text to enrich a stochastic agent, playing against the built-in AI of Civilization II. They train an agent with the Monte-Carlo search framework in order to jointly learn to identify text that is relevant to a given game state as well as game strategies based only on environment feedback. BIBREF40 utilize natural language in a model-based approach to describe the dynamics and rewards of an environment, showing these can facilitate transfer between different domains.More recently, the structure and compositionality of natural language has been used for representing policies in hierarchical RL. In a paper by BIBREF41, instructions given in natural language were used in order to break down complex problems into high-level plans and lower-level actions. Their suggested framework leverages the structure inherent to natural language, allowing for transfer to unfamiliar tasks and situations. This use of semantic structure has also been leveraged by BIBREF42, where abstract actions (not necessarily words) were recognized as symbols of a natural and expressive language, improving performance and transfer of RL agents.Outside the context of RL, previous work has also shown that high-quality linguistic representations can assist in cross-modal transfer, such as using semantic relationships between labels for zero-shot transfer in image classification BIBREF43, BIBREF44.Appendix ::: Natural language State SpaceA semantic representation using natural language should contain information which can be deduced by a human playing the game. For example, even though a human does not know the exact distance between objects, it can classify them as \\"close\\" or \\"far\\". However, objects that are outside the player's field of vision can not be a part of the state. Furthermore, a human would most likely refer to an object's location relative to itself, using directions such as \\"right\\" or \\"left\\".Appendix ::: Model implementationAll of our models were implemented using PyTorch. The DQN agents used a single network that outputs the Q-Values of the available actions. The PPO agents used an Actor-Critic model with two networks; the first outputs the policy distribution for the input state, and the second network outputs it's value. As mentioned earlier, we used three common neural network architectures:used for the raw image and semantic segmentation based agents. VizDoom's raw output image resolution is 640X480X3 RGB image. We experimented with both the original image and its down-sampled version. The semantic segmentation image was of resolution 640X480X1, where the pixel value represents the object's class, generated using the VizDoom label API. the network consisted of two convolutional layers, two hidden linear layers and an output layer. The first convolutional layer has 8 6X6 filters with stride 3 and ReLU activation. The second convolutional layer has 16 3X3 filters with stride 2 and ReLU activation. The fully connected layers has 32 and 16 units, both of them are followed by ReLU activation. The output layer's size is the amount of actions the agent has available in the trained scenario.Used in the feature vector based agent. Naturally, some discretization is needed in order to build a feature vector, so some of the state data is lost. the feature vector was made using features we extracted from the VizDoom API, and its dimensions was 90 X 1. The network is made up of two fully connected layers, each of them followed by a ReLU activation. The first layer has 32 units, and the second one one has 16 units. The output layer's size was the amount of actions available to the agent.Used in the natural language based agent. As previously mentioned, each word in the natural language state is transformed into a 200X50X1 matrix. The first layers of the TextCNN are convolutional layers with 8 filter which are designed to scan input sentence, and return convolution outputs of sequences of varying lengths. The filters vary in width, such that each of them learns to identify different lengths of sequences in words. Longer filters have higher capability of extracting features from longer word sequences. The filters we have chosen have the following dimensions: 3X50X1, 4X50X1, 5X50X1, 8X50X1,11X50X1. Following the convolution layer there is a ReLU activation and a max pool layer. Finally, there are two fully connected layers; The first layer has 32 units, and second one has 16 units. Both of them are followed by ReLU activation.All architectures have the same output, regardless of the input type. The DQN network is a regression network, with its output size the number of available actions. The PPO agent has 2 networks; actor and critic. The actor network has a Softmax activation with size equal to the available amount of actions. The critic network is a regression model with a single output representing the state's value. Reward plots for the PPO agent can be found in Figure FIGREF47.Figure 1: Example of Semantic Segmentation [Kundu et al., 2016].Figure 2: Left: Raw visual inputs and their corresponding semantic segmentation in the VizDoom enviornment.

CONCLUSION: A nasal spray containing carrageenan and Zanamivir should therefore be tested for prevention and treatment of uncomplicated influenza in clinical trials. Text: The periodic appearance of new influenza variants poses a worldwide pandemic threat. Since the emergence of the new A(H7N9) virus, more than 400 human cases were reported to the WHO with a mortality rate of more than 35%. Most patients with A(H7N9) infections had contact with poultry or visited live animal markets. However, some sporadic cases seemed to be a result of human to human transmissions [1, 2] . In contrast to pandemic viruses which fulminantly enter the human population and cause high mortality rates, seasonal influenza viruses generally cause uncomplicated and transient infections in humans, with virus replication localized to the upper respiratory tract [3, 4] . However, in its fully developed form influenza is an acute respiratory disease resulting in hospitalizations and deaths mainly among high-risk groups. Worldwide, annual epidemics result in about three to five million cases of severe illness, and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths [5] . For this reason WHO [6] and CDC [7] recommend antiviral treatment for any patient with suspected influenza who is at risk for influenza complications without previous laboratory confirmation. It is known that influenza virus infections are often accompanied by other viral pathogens [8] . Depending on the detection method (qRT-PCR or immunofluorescence) different ratios of co-infections have been found. Analysis by qRT-PCR revealed that 54.5-83.3% of influenza A or B positive patients were found to have at least one concomitant respiratory viral infection [9] [10] [11] [12] . The detection frequency with immunofluorescence was found to be even higher (90-100%) [13, 14] . Potential concomitant viral pathogens of influenza virus infections include human rhinovirus (hRV), respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, human coronavirus, human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus [14, 15] . As a result of the multiple infections, a specific anti-influenza mono-therapy treats the influenza virus infection only, but not the infection with the concomitant viral pathogen. Hence, the therapy often fails to sufficiently resolve symptoms. This is also reflected by the fact that neuraminidase inhibitors (NI) are highly efficacious in animal models investigating influenza mono-infections [16, 17] but show lower efficacy against influenza symptoms in clinical trials in adults with natural infections [18] . Therefore, there is a high medical need for a broadly acting antiviral therapy in combination with a specific anti-influenza therapy for treatment of patients suffering from upper respiratory tract symptoms. Ideally, the substances present in the combination complement each other by different modes of action, leading to a treatment that provides full protection against a broad range of different respiratory viruses as well as different influenza strains with a low probability to induce escape mutations. One approach for a broad antiviral therapy is the creation of a protective physical barrier in the nasal cavity using carrageenan. Carrageenan is a high molecular weight sulfated polymer derived from red seaweed (Rhodophyceae) that has been extensively used in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry and is generally recognized as safe by the FDA (GRAS) (reviewed in [19] ). Three main forms of carrageenans are commercially used: kappa, iota and lambda. They differ from each other in the degree of sulfation, solubility and gelling properties [20] . The antiviral mechanism of carrageenan is based on the interference with viral attachment; as a consequence, viral entry is inhibited [21, 22] . Its antiviral activity is dependent on the type of polymer as well as the virus and the host cells [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] and has been reviewed in [33] [34] [35] . We published that iota-carrageenan is a potent inhibitor of hRV [36] and influenza A [37] replication and demonstrated the antiviral efficacy of iota-carrageenan against common cold viruses by intranasal application in several randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled clinical trials [38] [39] [40] . The pooled analysis of two studies conducted in 153 children and 203 adults revealed that patients infected with any respiratory virus, who were intranasally treated with iota-carrageenan showed a 1.9 day faster recovery from common cold symptoms than placebo treated patients in the intention-to-treat population [41, 42] . The anti-influenza activity was shown by subgroup analysis of 49 influenza infected patients who benefited from a 3.3 days faster recovery from symptoms. The use of carrageenan nasal spray was associated with a significant reduction of the influenza viral load in nasal fluids and a significant increase in the number of virus free patients within the treatment period of 7 days. In good accordance Prieschl-Grassauer are co-founders of Marinomed Biotechnologie GmbH. Marinomed Biotechnologie GmbH had a role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, preparation of the manuscript and is financing the processing charge of the manuscript. with the literature [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] we observed that the majority of influenza virus infected patients suffered from a concomitant respiratory viral infection (66%) as determined by real-time PCR. Carrageenan containing nasal sprays are already marketed for the treatment of respiratory viral infections under different brand names in 18 countries. At present the only available effective drugs for treatment and post exposure prevention of influenza are the NI (Oseltamivir and Zanamivir worldwide; Peramivir in Japan and South Korea). Since the large-scale use of M2 blockers for prophylaxis and treatment in humans [43] and farming [44] , the currently circulating influenza viruses already lack sensitivity to this drug group [45] . We have already shown an additive therapeutic effect of a combination therapy with intranasally applied iota-carrageenan and orally administered Oseltamivir in lethally H1N1 A/PR/ 8/34 infected mice and a treatment start 48 hours post infection (hpi) [37] . Due to these very promising results we further developed the concept of combining carrageenan with an NI therapy. In contrast to Oseltamivir, which needs to be activated by metabolic conversion, Zanamivir is directly applied as active drug and can also be administered intranasally [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . The potential of an intranasal administration of Zanamivir was investigated by GlaxoSmithKline. In seven clinical challenge trials 66 volunteers were infected with influenza B/Yamagata/16/88 and 213 with influenza A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1). 156 of these participants got intranasally applied Zanamivir at different doses (daily dose levels from 6.4 mg to 96 mg) for prophylaxis or therapy [46, 47, 53, 54] . These challenge trials showed that treatment starting before and up to 36 hours post virus inoculation was associated with prevention of laboratory confirmed influenza and febrile illness as well as a reduction in viral titers, duration of shedding and symptoms. In total, safety data from 1092 patients after intranasal application of Zanamivir were published and no evidence for Zanamivir induced adverse events or increased frequencies of local nasal intolerance in comparison to placebo groups was found [46, 49, 52] . Taken together, the combination of a carrageenan nasal spray that provides broad antiviral activity against upper respiratory infections-including influenza-with Zanamivir, a specific anti-influenza drug, meets the existing medical need to treat multiple viral infections. In the present work we investigate the therapeutic effect of a combination of carrageenan and Zanamivir in-vitro and in an animal model. Kappa-carrageenan and iota-carrageenan were purchased from FMC Biopolymers (Philadelphia, PA). The identity, purity (>95%) of carrageenan subtypes and the molecular weight (>100,000) was confirmed by NMR analysis as described elsewhere [55] and the presence of lambda-carrageenan was below the detection limit of 3%. The dry polymer powders were dissolved in aqua bidest (Fresenius Kabi, Austria) to a final concentration of 2.4 mg/ml iota-and 0.8 mg/ml kappa-carrageenan. This 2x stock solution was sterile filtered through a 0.22 μm filter (PAA, Switzerland) and stored at room temperature until use. For further testing the stock solution was diluted to a mixture containing 1.2 mg/ml iota-carrageenan and 0.4 mg/ml kappa-carrageenan (hereinafter referred to as \\"carrageenan\\"). Zanamivir was purchased as powder (Haosun Pharma, China) and the identity and purity was confirmed by NMR analysis. Zanamivir was either dissolved in carrageenan or placebo solutions, followed by sterile filtration through a 0.22 μm filter (Sarstedt, Germany). For in-vivo studies all Zanamivir containing solutions were freshly prepared. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and cultivated in a 37°C incubator (Sanyo, Japan; CO 2 : 5%, relative humidity: >95%). MDCK cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential (DMEM) high glucose medium (PAA, Austria) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAA, Austria; heat inactivated). Influenza virus A/Hansa Hamburg/01/09 (H1N1(09)pdm) was kindly provided by Peter Staeheli Department of Virology, University of Freiburg, Germany and previously described in [56] ; A/Teal/Germany/Wv632/05 (H5N1) previously published in [57] (accession numbers CY061882-9) and A/Turkey/Germany/R11/01 (H7N7) (taxonomy ID 278191, accession number AEZ68716) were supplied by courtesy of Martin Beer, Institute of Diagnostic Virology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, Riems, Germany; A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) was purchased from the ATCC. All influenza viruses were propagated in MDCK cells at 37°C and 5% CO 2 in influenza medium [Opti-Pro serum free medium (Gibco, Austria) supplemented with 4 mM L-glutamine (PAA, Austria), 1% antibiotic-antimycotic mix (PAA, Austria) and 5 μg/ml trypsin (Sigma Aldrich, Austria)]. To determine the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) and the combination effect of carrageenan and Zanamivir, a semi-liquid plaque assay was developed. Into 96 well tissue culture plates 1.7x10 4 MDCK cells/well were seeded and infected at 90% confluence (24-28 hours later). Serial dilutions of carrageenan and Zanamivir were prepared in assay medium (influenza medium without trypsin). For infection, viruses were diluted to an MOI of 0.003 (H1N1(09)pdm and H3N2 Aichi), 0.015 (H5N1) or 0.004 (H7N7), respectively, in assay medium and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 10 min with the serial dilutions of carrageenan and/or Zanamivir, respectively. For evaluation of the combination effect of carrageenan and Zanamivir, viruses were diluted in assay medium containing constant concentrations of either carrageenan or Zanamivir. The other substance was serially diluted and used for virus incubation. Cells were infected in 6 replicates/compound dilution, respectively, and incubated at RT for 45 min before inoculum removal. Cells were further incubated with the respective concentration of the investigated substances present in the overlay [influenza medium with 2.25% Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC, Fluka, Austria)] for 30-42 hours at 37°C. Evolving plaques were evaluated after methanol/acetone cell fixation by immune staining with antibodies either directed against the influenza A nucleoprotein (AbD Serotec, Germany) (for H1N1(09)pdm, H5N1 and H7N7) or the hemagglutinin (AbD Serotec, Germany) (for H3N2). Analysis was done with a HRP labeled detection antibody (Thermo Scientific, Germany) using TMB (Biolegend, Germany) as substrate and a microplate reader at 450 nm. The reduction of detected signal represents a reduction in the number and size of plaques and indicates suppression of viral replication during infection and cultivation. After the immunostaining cells were stained with 0.005% crystal violet solution to assess the condition of the cell layer and the toxicity of the compounds. IC 50 values and standard deviations were calculated for a sigmoidal dose response model using XLfit Excel add-in version 5.3.1.3. All animal experiments were carried out according to the guidelines of the \\"European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes\\" and the Austrian law for animal experiments. All animal experiments were approved by the Veterinary University of Vienna institutional ethics committee and performed under the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science and Research experimental animal license numbers BMWF-68.205/0262-II/3b/2011 and BMWF-68.205/0142-II/3b2012. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Janvier Labs, France and maintained under standard laboratory conditions in the animal facilities of the Veterinary University of Vienna. For euthanasia and anesthesia asphyxiation through CO 2 was used and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.Question: What is the optimal window for initiating treatment with carageenan and Zanamivir?","answer":"72 hours post infection"},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2019 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

with the median age of 25.5 years ( range 15 - 52 years ) [ table 1 ] .comparison of demographic , clinical and para - clinical manifestations in survival and non - survival groups in all of the patients , the route of exposure was oral ingestion . only 9 ( 30% ) of the patients had the history of chronic misuse of alcohol . in 24 ( 80% ) of the patients ,the type of alcohol was illegal hand - made alcoholic beverages . only 3 ( 10% ) of the patients had a history of consumption of industrial alcohol ( a kind of alcoholic product that used only as a household cleaner and not for a drink ) , and in 3 ( 10% ) of the patients the type of alcohol source was unknown .the median time between intake of alcohol to admission on a hospital was 24 h ( range 4 - 96 h ) [ table 1 ] .visual disturbances , respiratory manifestations , and loss of consciousness were the most common clinical manifestations 64% ( 95% confidence interval [ ci ] : 0.44 - 0.80 ) , 47% ( 95% ci : 0.28 - 0.66 ) and 47% ( 95% ci : 0.28 - 0.66 ) respectively on admission time .13 patients ( 43% ) had mydriasis . in 5 ( 17% ) of the patients , the pupils were unresponsive to light [ table 2 ] .distribution of patients according to clinical manifestations on admission time the median of blood methanol level was 20 mg / dl ( range 7 - 75 mg / dl ) [ table 1 ] .a total of 11 patients ( 37% ) had methanol level 20 mg / dl to < 50 mg / dl and seven patients ( 23% ) had methanol level more than 50 mg / dl , one of them survived and the other six ones died . only three patients ( 10% ) had methanol level 5 mg / dl to < 10 mg / dl and in others , methanol level was 10 mg / dl to < 20 mg / dl .analyze of venous blood gas on admission showed that the median of ph was 7.15 with a range of 6.73 - 7.32 [ table 1 ] .most of the patients ( 60% ) had ph 7 < to 7.20 , 12 of them survived and six others died . furthermore from seven patients who had ph 7.20all of the three patients who had the ph above 7.30 , survived and two patients who had the ph less than 7 died .the median of paco2 was 22.35 mmhg ( range of 2.70 - 46.60 mmhg ) [ table 1 ] .in most of the patients ( 80% ) , paco2 was less than 35 mmhg .only two patients ( 7% ) had paco2 35 mmhg to < 45 mmhg , one of them survived and the other died [ figure 1 ] .figure 2 shows the relationship between ph and paco2 in survivors and non - survivors .distribution of patients regarding to their paco2 and outcome relationship of ph with paco2 in survivors and non - survivors the median of hco3 was 7.2meq / l [ table 1 ] . in most of the patients ( 47% ) , hco3 level was 5 < meq / l to 10 meq / l .none of them had hco3 level more than 20 meq / l , and only five patients ( 17% ) had hco3 level 15 < meq / l to 20most of the patients ( 60% ) had leukocytosis , and in others the numbers of white blood cells ( wbc ) were within normal range .40% of the patients showed hyperkalemia and in others the level of potassium was in the normal range .hyperglycemia was also observed in 21 ( 70% ) of the patients and in others , the blood glucose level was in the normal range .the median of blood sugar was 184.5 mg / dl with the range of 70 - 540 mg / dl [ table 1 ] .the median of total dose of sodium bicarbonate , which was administered in patients , was 425the median duration of ethanol therapy was 1 day with the range of 0 - 4 days . in 14 ( 46% ) of the patients hemodialysisthe median time interval between hospital admission and beginning of hemodialysis was 4 h with the range of 0 - 17 h [ table 1 ] .a total of 8 ( 27% ) of the patients were admitted in intensive care unit .the median duration of hospitalization was 48 h ( range 3 - 240 h ) [ table 1 ] .total 9 ( 30% ) of the patients died ; while two of the remaining survivors became blind .mortality rate in comatose and non - comatose cases was 50% versus 12.5% , respectively with odds ratio 7 ( 1.14 - 42.97 , 95% ci ) .the mortality rate in patients with respiratory depression was 80% in compare to 20% in patients without depression of respiration , with odds ratio 16 ( 1.45 - 176.45 , 95% ci ) .there was a correlation between methanol level ( r = 0.44 , p = 0.01 ) , paco2 ( r = 0.43 , p = 0.02 ) , leukocytosis ( r = 0.41 , p = 0.03 ) , blood sugar ( r = 0.60 , p = 0.000 ) and death .the present study shows that the oral ingestion of illegal hand - made spirits is a most common cause of acute methanol poisoning in tehran .this result is similar to our previous finding and other researchers . in iran , according to national regulations , selling , buying , and consumption of alcoholic drinks is a punishable crime .therefore , the use of homemade , illegal and non - standard alcoholic beverages can cause acute methanol intoxication .the present results show that the young men are the major patients suffer from methanol poisoning .this is in concordance with our previous studies about general pattern of acute chemical and pharmaceutical poisoning in tehran . in this study ,the median time interval between methanol intakes to admission on a hospital was 24 h. it can be due to this fact that methanol is not toxic by itself and it must be metabolized to toxic metabolites like as formate .methanol is oxidized by alcohol dehydrogenase to formaldehyde , which is oxidized to formic acid by formaldehyde dehydrogenase . thenthis process is time consuming and from this view , the clinical presentations in methanol poisoning appear after a latent period .it is similar to our previous finding about mortality in acute methanol poisoning and other researchers .the ophthalmic , respiratory , and central nervous system involvements were the most common clinical manifestations .these results supported by previous studies . although , in the present study , the mean blood methanol level in our patients is lower than other studies , but it is similar to our previous result .this may be related to the delay of admission of the patients in the hospital .the treatment , including duration of ethanol therapy , total dose of bicarbonate and time interval between hospital admission and beginning of hemodialysis was similar in both survivor and non - survivor groups ; so the difference in the outcome of the patients could be related to their clinical and paraclinical status on admission time . in the present study , we found a significant difference between survivors and non - survivors with regard to coma grade , depression of respiration , paco2 , blood methanol level , leukocytosis , and blood sugar .furthermore , there was a correlation between coma grade , depression of respiration , paco2 , blood methanol level , leukocytosis , blood sugar and death , which is the same as previous published data . respiratory arrest and increased paco2 in the severely acidotic methanol - intoxicated casesthe current study confirms earlier studies showing mortality correlating with the lack of compensatory hyperventilation in spite of and only when there is a profound metabolic acidosis .hyperglycemia is recently shown as a prognostic marker and the same finding in this study is thus very interesting .the exact mechanism of hyperglycemia is not clear but it has been supposed that methanol poisoning can be associated with acute pancreatitis and this can be suggestive in creating hyperglycemia .furthermore increased counter regulatory hormones from the acute stress of methanol poisoning could be another suggestive mechanism . in spite of the results of previous studies , which showed a correlation between blood ph and poor prognosis, we did not find any significant difference in blood ph between survivor and non - survivor groups .one of the explanations is that the blood h + concentration is regulated by pco2 and level of blood hco3 , so it will not necessarily be found in all patient populations depending on the their compensatory situations .the other reasons could be the fact that this study is retrospective and the number of patients is relatively small , which could be considered as a limitation of this study .according to the results of this study , it could be concluded that coma , respiratory depression , paco2 and hyperglycemia are strong predictors of poor outcome .furthermore , hyperglycemia might be a new prognostic factor in methanol poisoning , but further studies are needed to determine whether controlling hyperglycemia has therapeutic consequences .","answer":"background : methanol poisoning is one of the most important poisoning due to drinking of illegal and non - standard alcoholic beverage in some countries .  relatively limited studies have been carried out to identify the prognostic factors in methanol poisoning.materials and methods : we performed a retrospective study on acute methanol - intoxicated patients , which were admitted on the loghman hakim hospital poison center ( tehran , iran ) over a 24-month period .  the demographic data , clinical manifestations and paraclinical findings , therapeutic interventions and outcome ( survivors with or without complications and non - survivors ) were extracted.results:we evaluated 30 patients with methanol poisoning during 2 years .  all of the patients were male ;

In particular, for any @math , we obtain an efficient dimension-preserving reduction from @math -SVP to @math -GapSVP and an efficient dimension-preserving reduction from @math -CVP to @math -GapCVP. These results generalize the known equivalences of the search and decision versions of these problems in the exact case when @math . For SVP, we actually obtain something slightly stronger than a search-to-decision reduction---we reduce @math -SVP to @math -unique SVP, a potentially easier problem than @math -GapSVP.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Our main result is a reduction from worst-case lattice problems such as GapSVP and SIVP to a certain learning problem. This learning problem is a natural extension of the “learning from parity with error” problem to higher moduli. It can also be viewed as the problem of decoding from a random linear code. This, we believe, gives a strong indication that these problems are hard. Our reduction, however, is quantum. Hence, an efficient solution to the learning problem implies a quantum algorithm for GapSVP and SIVP. A main open question is whether this reduction can be made classical (i.e., nonquantum). We also present a (classical) public-key cryptosystem whose security is based on the hardness of the learning problem. By the main result, its security is also based on the worst-case quantum hardness of GapSVP and SIVP. The new cryptosystem is much more efficient than previous lattice-based cryptosystems: the public key is of size O(n2) and encrypting a message increases its size by a factor of O(n) (in previous cryptosystems these values are O(n4) and O(n2), respectively). In fact, under the assumption that all parties share a random bit string of length O(n2), the size of the public key can be reduced to O(n).[2]: We prove the equivalence, up to a small polynomial approximation factor @math , of the lattice problems uSVP (unique Shortest Vector Problem), BDD (Bounded Distance Decoding) and GapSVP (the decision version of the Shortest Vector Problem). This resolves a long-standing open problem about the relationship between uSVP and the more standard GapSVP, as well the BDD problem commonly used in coding theory. The main cryptographic application of our work is the proof that the Ajtai-Dwork ([2]) and the Regev ([33]) cryptosystems, which were previously only known to be based on the hardness of uSVP, can be equivalently based on the hardness of worst-case GapSVP @math and GapSVP @math , respectively. Also, in the case of uSVP and BDD, our connection is very tight, establishing the equivalence (within a small constant approximation factor) between the two most central problems used in lattice based public key cryptography and coding theory.[3]: [4]: We give several improvements on the known hardness of the unique shortest vector problem. - We give a deterministic reduction from the shortest vector problem to the unique shortest vector problem. As a byproduct, we get deterministic NP-hardness for unique shortest vector problem in the @math norm. - We give a randomized reduction from SAT to uSVP_ 1+1 poly(n) . This shows that uSVP_ 1+1 poly(n) is NP-hard under randomized reductions. - We show that if GapSVP_ coNP (or coAM) then uSVP_ coNP (coAM respectively). This simplifies previously known uSVP_ n^ 1 4 coAM proof by Cai Cai98 to uSVP_ (n n)^ 1 4 coAM, and additionally generalizes it to uSVP_ n^ 1 4 coNP. - We give a deterministic reduction from search-uSVP_ to the decision-uSVP_ 2 . We also show that the decision-uSVP is NP -hard for randomized reductions, which does not follow from Kumar-Sivakumar KS01 .","answer":"Some efficient dimension-preserving search-to-decision reductions were known for other lattice problems prior to this work. For example, Regev showed such a reduction for Learning with Errors, an important average-case lattice problem with widespread applications in cryptography [1] . (Both the search and decision versions of LWE are average-case problems.) And, Liu, Lyubashevsky, and Micciancio implicitly use a search-to-decision reduction for Bounded Distance Decoding in their work [3] . Finally, Aggarwal and Dubey showed how to use some of the ideas from [2] to obtain a search-to-decision reduction for unique SVP [4] . While all of these works are quite interesting, they are concerned with promise problems, and not the two most important and natural lattice problems, SVP and CVP."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

METHODS: We compared relevant time metrics between patients with acute ischemic stroke receiving intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and/or endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) before and after the declared restrictions and state of emergency imposed in our region (March 17, 2020). RESULTS: We identified a significant increase in the median door-to-CT times for patients receiving intravenous tPA (19 min, interquartile range (IQR): 14-27 min vs. 13 min, IQR: 9-17 min, p = 0.008) and/or EVT (20 min, IQR: 15-33 min vs. 11 min, IQR: 5-20 min, p = 0.035) after the start of social and healthcare restrictions in our region compared to the previous 12 months. For patients receiving intravenous tPA treatment, we also found a significant increase (p = 0.005) in the median door-to-needle time (61 min, IQR: 46-72 min vs. 37 min, IQR: 30-50 min). No delays in the time from symptom onset to hospital presentation were uncovered for patients receiving tPA and/or endovascular reperfusion treatments in the first 1.5 months after the establishment of regional and institutional restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

We also introduce a new data set that can be used to test lemmatization accuracy, and an efficient lemmatization algorithm that outperforms state-of-the-art Arabic lemmatization in terms of accuracy and speed. We share the data set and the code for public.IntroductionLemmatization is the process of finding the base form (or lemma) of a word by considering its inflected forms. Lemma is also called dictionary form, or citation form, and it refers to all words having the same meaning.Lemmatization is an important preprocessing step for many applications of text mining and question-answering systems, and researches in Arabic Information Retrieval (IR) systems show the need for representing Arabic words at lemma level for many applications, including keyphrase extraction BIBREF0 and machine translation BIBREF1 . In addition, lemmatization provides a productive way to generate generic keywords for search engines (SE) or labels for concept maps BIBREF2 .Word stem is that core part of the word that never changes even with morphological inflections; the part that remains after prefix and suffix removal. Sometimes the stem of the word is different than its lemma, for example the words: believe, believed, believing, and unbelievable share the stem (believ-), and have the normalized word form (believe) standing for the infinitive of the verb (believe).While stemming tries to remove prefixes and suffixes from words that appear with inflections in free text, lemmatization tries to replace word suffixes with (typically) different suffix to get its lemma.This extended abstract is organized as follows: Section SECREF2 shows some complexities in building Arabic lemmatization, and surveys prior work on Arabic stemming and lemmatization; Section SECREF3 introduces the dataset that we created to test lemmatization accuracy; Section SECREF4 describes the algorithm of the system that we built and report results and error analysis in section SECREF5 ; and Section SECREF6 discusses the results and concludes the abstract.BackgroundArabic is the largest Semitic language spoken by more than 400 million people. It's one of the six official languages in the United Nations, and the fifth most widely spoken language after Chinese, Spanish, English, and Hindi. Arabic has a very rich morphology, both derivational and inflectional. Generally, Arabic words are derived from a root that uses three or more consonants to define a broad meaning or concept, and they follow some templatic morphological patterns. By adding vowels, prefixes and suffixes to the root, word inflections are generated. For instance, the word ÙØ³ÙÙØªØ­ÙÙ> (wsyftHwn) “and they will open” has the triliteral root ÙØªØ­> (ftH), which has the basic meaning of opening, has prefixes ÙØ³> (ws) “and will”, suffixes ÙÙ> (wn) “they”, stem ÙÙØªØ­> (yftH) “open”, and lemma ÙØªØ­> (ftH) “the concept of opening”.IR systems typically cluster words together into groups according to three main levels: root, stem, or lemma. The root level is considered by many researchers in the IR field which leads to high recall but low precision due to language complexity, for example words ÙØªØ¨Ø Ù ÙØªØ¨Ø©Ø ÙØªØ§Ø¨> (ktb, mktbp, ktAb) “wrote, library, book” have the same root ÙØªØ¨> (ktb) with the basic meaning of writing, so searching for any of these words by root, yields getting the other words which may not be desirable for many users.Other researchers show the importance of using stem level for improving retrieval precision and recall as they capture semantic similarity between inflected words. However, in Arabic, stem patterns may not capture similar words having the same semantic meaning. For example, stem patterns for broken plurals are different from their singular patterns, e.g. the plural Ø£ÙÙØ§Ù > (AqlAm) “pens” will not match the stem of its singular form ÙÙÙ > (qlm) “pen”. The same applies to many imperfect verbs that have different stem patterns than their perfect verbs, e.g. the verbs Ø§Ø³ØªØ·Ø§Ø¹Ø ÙØ³ØªØ·ÙØ¹> (AstTAE, ystTyE) “he could, he can” will not match because they have different stems. Indexing using lemmatization can enhance the performance of Arabic IR systems.A lot of work has been done in word stemming and lemmatization in different languages, for example the famous Porter stemmer for English, but for Arabic, there are few work has been done especially in lemmatization, and there is no open-source code and new testing data that can be used by other researchers for word lemmatization. Xerox Arabic Morphological Analysis and Generation BIBREF3 is one of the early Arabic stemmers, and it uses morphological rules to obtain stems for nouns and verbs by looking into a table of thousands of roots.Khoja's stemmer BIBREF4 and Buckwalter morphological analyzer BIBREF5 are other root-based analyzers and stemmers which use tables of valid combinations between prefixes and suffixes, prefixes and stems, and stems and suffixes. Recently, MADAMIRA BIBREF6 system has been evaluated using a blind testset (25K words for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) selected from Penn Arabic Tree bank (PATB)), and the reported accuracy was 96.2% as the percentage of words where the chosen analysis (provided by SAMA morphological analyzer BIBREF7 ) has the correct lemma.In this paper, we present an open-source Java code to extract Arabic word lemmas, and a new publicly available testset for lemmatization allowing researches to evaluate using the same dataset that we used, and reproduce same experiments.Data DescriptionTo make the annotated data publicly available, we selected 70 news articles from Arabic WikiNews site https://ar.wikinews.org/wiki. These articles cover recent news from year 2013 to year 2015 in multiple genres (politics, economics, health, science and technology, sports, arts, and culture.) Articles contain 18,300 words, and they are evenly distributed among these 7 genres with 10 articles per each.Word are white-space and punctuation separated, and some spelling errors are corrected (1.33% of the total words) to have very clean test cases. Lemmatization is done by an expert Arabic linguist where spelling corrections are marked, and lemmas are provided with full diacritization as shown in Figure FIGREF2 .As MSA is usually written without diacritics and IR systems normally remove all diacritics from search queries and indexed data as a basic preprocessing step, so another column for undiacritized lemma is added and it's used for evaluating our lemmatizer and comparing with state-of-the-art system for lemmatization; MADAMIRA.system DescriptionWe were inspired by the work done by BIBREF8 for segmenting Arabic words out of context. They achieved an accuracy of almost 99%; slightly better than state-of-the-art system for segmentation (MADAMIRA) which considers surrounding context and many linguistic features. This system shows enhancements in both Machine Translation, and Information Retrieval tasks BIBREF9 . This work can be considered as an extension to word segmentation.From a large diacritized corpus, we constructed a dictionary of words and their possible diacritizations ordered by number of occurrences of each diacritized form. This diacritized corpus was created by a commercial vendor and contains 9.7 million words with almost 200K unique surface words. About 73% of the corpus is in MSA and covers variety of genres like politics, economy, sports, society, etc. and the remaining part is mostly religious texts written in classical Arabic (CA). The effectiveness of using this corpus in building state-of-the-art diacritizer was proven in BIBREF10 .For example, the word ÙØ¨ÙÙØ¯> (wbnwd) “and items” is found 4 times in this corpus with two full diacritization forms ÙÙØ¨ÙÙÙÙØ¯ÙØ ÙÙØ¨ÙÙÙÙØ¯Ù> (wabunudi, wabunudK) “items, with different grammatical case endings” which appeared 3 times and once respectively. All unique undiacritized words in this corpus were analyzed using Buckwalter morphological analyzer which gives all possible word diacritizations, and their segmentation, POS tag and lemma as shown in Figure FIGREF3 .The idea is to take the most frequent diacritized form for words appear in this corpus, and find the morphological analysis with highest matching score between its diacritized form and the corpus word. This means that we search for the most common diacritization of the word regardless of its surrounding context. In the above example, the first solution is preferred and hence its lemma Ø¨ÙØ¯> (banod, bnd after diacritics removal) “item”.While comparing two diacritized forms from the corpus and Buckwalter analysis, special cases were applied to solve inconsistencies between the two diacritization schemas, for example while words are fully diacritized in the corpus, Buckwalter analysis gives diacritics without case ending (i.e. without context), and removes short vowels in some cases, for example before long vowels, and after the definite article Ø§Ù> (Al) “the”, etc.It worths mentioning that there are many cases in Buckwalter analysis where for the input word, there are two or more identical diacritizations with different lemmas, and the analyses of such words are provided without any meaningful order. For example the word Ø³ÙØ§Ø±Ø©> (syArp) “car” has two morphological analyses with different lemmas, namely Ø³ÙØ§Ø±> (syAr) “walker”, and Ø³ÙØ§Ø±Ø©> (syArp) “car” in this order while the second lemma is the most common one. To solve tis problem, all these words are reported and the top frequent words are revised and order of lemmas were changed according to actual usage in modern language.The lemmatization algorithm can be summarized in Figure FIGREF4 , and the online system can be tested through the site http://alt.qcri.org/farasa/segmenter.htmlEvaluationData was formatted in a plain text format where sentences are written in separate lines and words are separated by spaces, and the outputs of MADAMIRA and our system are compared against the undiacritized lemma for each word. For accurate results, all differences were revised manually to accept cases that should not be counted as errors (different writings of foreign names entities for example as in ÙÙÙØº ÙÙÙØºØ ÙÙÙØ¬ ÙÙÙØ¬> (hwng kwng, hwnj kwnj) “Hong Kong”, or more than one accepted lemma for some function words, e.g the lemmas ÙÙØ ÙÙÙ Ø§> (fy, fymA) are both valid for the function word ÙÙÙ Ø§> (fymA) “while”).Table TABREF5 shows results of testing our system and MADAMIRA on the WikiNews testset (for undiacritized lemmas). Our approach gives +7% relative gain above MADAMIRA in lemmatization task.In terms of speed, our system was able to lemmatize 7.4 million words on a personal laptop in almost 2 minutes compared to 2.5 hours for MADAMIRA, i.e. 75 times faster. The code is written entirely in Java without any external dependency which makes its integration in other systems quite simple.Error AnalysisMost of the lemmatization errors in our system are due to fact that we use the most common diacritization of words without considering their contexts which cannot solve the ambiguity in cases like nouns and adjectives that share the same diacritization forms, for example the word Ø£ÙØ§Ø¯ÙÙ ÙØ©> (AkAdymyp) can be either a noun and its lemma is Ø£ÙØ§Ø¯ÙÙ ÙØ©> (AkAdymyp) “academy”, or an adjective and its lemma is Ø£ÙØ§Ø¯ÙÙ Ù> (AkAdymy) “academic”. Also for MADAMIRA, errors in selecting the correct Part-of-Speech (POS) for ambiguous words, and foreign named entities.In the full paper, we will quantify error cases in our lemmatizer and MADAMIRA and give examples for each case which can help in enhancing both systems.DiscussionIn this paper, we introduce a new dataset for Arabic lemmatization and a very fast and accurate lemmatization algorithm that performs better than state-of-the art system; MADAMIRA. Both the dataset and the code will be publicly available. We show that to build an effective IR system for complex derivational languages like Arabic, there is a a big need for very fast and accurate lemmatization algorithms, and we show that this can be achieved by considering only the most frequent diacritized form for words and matching this form with the morphological analysis with highest similarity score. We plan to study the performance if the algorithm was modified to provide diacritized lemmas which can be useful for other applications.Table 1: Examples of complex verb lemmatization casesTable 2: Examples of complex noun lemmatization casesFigure 2: Buckwalter analysis (diacritization forms and lemmas are highlighted)Figure 1: Lemmatization of WikiNews corpusTable 3: Lemmatization accuracy using WikiNews testsetFigure 4: Lemmatization online demo (part of Farasa Arabic NLP tools)Question: How was the dataset annotated?","answer":"{\\"answer\\": [\\"Lemmatization is done by an expert Arabic linguist where spelling corrections are marked, and lemmas are provided with full diacritization\\"], \\"evidence\\": [\\"To make the annotated data publicly available, we selected 70 news articles from Arabic WikiNews site https://ar.wikinews.org/wiki.

Text: Flavonoids are a class of plant secondary metabolites, which are chemically characterized by a 15-carbon backbone that consists of two phenyl rings and a heterocyclic ring. To date, over 10,000 flavonoids have been characterized from various plants, which are classified according to their chemical structure, i.e., the number and presence of hydroxyl groups and further functional group modifications into various subgroups, such as anthoxanthins, flavanones, and flavanonols [1, 2] . In recent years flavonoids have garnered much attention from various application domains because of the various beneficial effects on human health that have been attributed to them, such as anticancer [3] and antioxidant [4] to anti-inflammatory [5] , antimicrobial [6] and antiviral [6, 7] effects. As final step in their biosynthesis, flavonoids are often glycosylated which has a profound effect on their solubility, stability and bio-activity [8, 9] . For example, the best studied flavonol quercetin, which makes up to 75 % of our daily flavonoid intake, predominantly occurs as different glycosides. Over 350 different quercetin glycoforms have been reported to date with varying pharmacological properties [10, 11] . In this context, hyperoside (quercetin 3-O-galactoside) and quercitrin (quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside) ( Fig. 1) have gained a lot of attention as valuable products for the pharmaceutical industry e.g., as powerful antioxidants with cytoprotective effects [12] [13] [14] [15] and as promising antiviral agents that block replication of the influenza virus [16] or inhibit the viruses hepatitis B [17] and SARS [18] . Furthermore, they have been attributed with anti-inflammatory [19, 20] , antidepressant [21, 22] , apoptotic [23] and antifungal [24] activities, rendering them interesting therapeutics resulting in a steadily increasing market demand. To date, the majority of quercetin and its glycosides are extracted from plant material, which is generally a laborious and low-yielding process requiring many purification steps [25] . In vitro plant cell cultures or engineered plants can be used to overcome the low yields and improve production [26] [27] [28] , however since metabolic engineering of plants is both very controversial and still in its infancy [29] , this approach is often restricted to small-scale production. Although chemical synthesis of quercetin (glycosides) has proven to be feasible [30] [31] [32] , stereoselective formation of glycosidic linkages is often hampered by the presence of various reactive groups [33] , which requires many protecting and deprotecting steps [34] . In addition, the generation of toxic waste and a low atomefficiency [35] render these production processes neither sustainable nor economically viable. As a result, in the last two decades enormous efforts have been invested in the development of alternative production methods for these specialized (secondary) plant metabolites [36] . Advances in the fields of protein engineering, systems and synthetic biology have accelerated these efforts to transform model organisms like Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in real microbial cell factories for the sustainable production of flavonoids [37] [38] [39] . Subsequently, strategies for the in vivo glycosylation of flavonoids have also been developed. These are typically based on both the overexpression of specific glycosyltransferases, which transfer a sugar residue from an activated nucleotide sugar to an aglycon in a stereoand regioselective way, and the engineering or introduction of the targeted nucleotide sugar pathway. In this way, Fig. 1 Transformation of E. coli W into a sucrose-based galactosylation and rhamnosylation platform. The metabolic engineering strategy applied makes use of several gene deletions (indicated in red) and overexpressions of genes (indicated in green). The rational of a split metabolism is applied, whereby sucrose is divided by sucrose phosphorylase (BaSP) in fructose to be used for growth and a glucose 1-phosphate as activated precursor for UDP-glucose. The latter is a universal pivot molecule for the formation of UDP-galactose and UDP-rhamnose, interconversions catalyzed by the enzymes GalE and MUM4, respectively. To ensure growth-coupled production, various genes, involved in the metabolization of these UDPsugars and their precursors, were knocked out (shown in red). The production of the bioactive quercetin glycosides hyperoside and quercitrin was chosen to evaluate the versatility of the engineered production platform. Finally, the introduction of either the glycosyltransferase F3GT or RhaGT ensures efficient galactosylation or rhamnosylation, respectively various quercetin glycosides have already been produced in E. coli such as the naturally occurring 3-O-glucoside [40] , 3-O-xyloside [41] and 3,7-O-bisrhamnoside [42] , or the new-to-nature quercetin 3-O-(6-deoxytalose) [43] . However, despite these engineering efforts, the reported product rates and titers are still in the milligram range, rendering these microbial production hosts unsuitable for industrial applications. The developed production processes are typically biphasic bioconversion processes using resting cells, which makes it difficult to improve production rates [44] . Furthermore, such systems often entail expensive growth media or the addition of enzyme inducers, making the overall process very costly. To tackle these problems, we previously developed an efficient platform for the glucosylation of small molecules in E. coli W [45] . Through metabolic engineering, a mutant was created which couples the production of glucosides to growth, using sucrose as a cheap and sustainable carbon source. By introducing the sucrose phosphorylase from Bifidobacterium adolescentis (BaSP) sucrose can be split into fructose to be used for growth purposes and glucose 1-phosphate (glc1P) to be used as precursor for UDP-glucose (UDP-glc) formation ( Fig. 1) . To impede the conversion of glc1P into biomass precursors, several endogenous genes involved in its metabolization such as phosphoglucomutase (pgm) and glucose-1-phosphatase (agp) were knocked out. Subsequently, glc1P can efficiently be channeled towards UDP-glc by overexpressing the uridylyltransferase from Bifidobacterium bifidum (ugpA). Metabolization of UDP-glc is prevented by knocking out the UDP-sugar hydrolase (ushA) and the galactose operon (galETKM). However, in view of the pivotal role of UDP-glc in the production of a large variety of UDP-sugars, this glucosylation system can easily be extended towards other UDP-sugars, such as UDP-galactose (UDP-gal), UDPrhamnose (UDP-rha) and UDP-glucuronate. In the present contribution, this previously developed E. coli W-based glucosylation platform is transformed into a platform for galactosylation and rhamnosylation ( Fig. 1) , whose potential is demonstrated using the galactosylation and rhamnosylation of exogenously fed quercetin yielding hyperoside and quercitrin, respectively, as case study. Escherichia coli W is a fast-growing non-pathogenic strain which tolerates osmotic stress, acidic conditions, and can be cultured to high cell densities, making it an attractive host for industrial fermentations [46] . Moreover, E. coli W is able to grow on sucrose as sole carbon source [46] , which is an emerging feedstock for the production of bio-products. Hence, E. coli W was selected as host for sucrose-based in vivo glycosylation. Prior to the production of the glycosides hyperoside and quercitrin in E. coli W, the toxicity of their aglycon quercetin was investigated. To this end, the wild type (WT) strain was grown on minimal sucrose medium containing different concentrations of quercetin (0, 0.15 and 1.5 g/L). The specific growth rates (h −1 ) (0.96 ± 0.06, 0.92 ± 0.05 and 0.87 ± 0.06, respectively) were not significantly different (p ANOVA = 0.12) nor from the one previously determined for the WT [45] (p = 0.69, p = 0.98 and p = 0.68, respectively). On the other hand, the optical density at 600 nm after 24 h incubation (6.36 ± 0.12, 5.18 ± 0.16 and 4.77 ± 0.20, respectively) was lower (about 20 %) when quercetin was added (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.0001). No significant difference in optical density could be observed between 0.15 and 1.5 g/L quercetin (p = 0.14). In view of the above, it was opted to add 1.5 g/L quercetin to evaluate the potential of the developed glycosylation platform. To evaluate the in vivo glycosylation potential, strains sGAL1 and sRHA1, which constitutively express the flavonol 3-O-galactosyltransferase from Petunia hybrida and the flavonol 3-O-rhamnosyltransferase from A. thaliana, respectively, were cultured in minimal medium with 1.5 g/L of quercetin for 16 h. TLC analysis of the supernatants of both cultures yielded two new yellow product spots. The TLC spot obtained from the sGAL1 culture, which had the same retention time as the hyperoside standard (R f = 0.5), was subsequently purified and analyzed. Both NMR and MS analysis confirmed the production of quercetin 3-O-galactoside. However, the product spot obtained from the sRHA1 culture had a different retention factor (R f = 0.55) than the quercitrin standard (R f = 0.74), and was identified as isoquercitrin (quercetin 3-O-glucoside). As opposed to other reports on wild type E. coli strains expressing RhaGT, which simultaneously produced quercitrin (quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside) and isoquercitrin [47, 48] , no rhamnoside could be detected. Examination of the E. coli W genome revealed that the gene cluster responsible for the endogenous production of dTDP-rhamnose, which functions as an alternative rhamnosyldonor for RhaGT in E. coli B and K12 derivatives [47] , was not present [46, 49] . In a follow-up experiment, sGAL1 and sRHA1 were grown on minimal medium with two different concentrations (0.15 and 1.5 g/L) of quercetin. Growth and glycoside formation were monitored during 30 h. The final titers (C p ) and specific productivities (q p ) are shown in Fig. 2 . Remarkably, an increase in quercetin concentration resulted in a two to threefold increase in productivity and titer, indicating that quercetin supply is rate-limiting and crucial for efficient in vivo glycosylation. However, while sGAL1 continuously produced hyperoside during the exponential phase, which is also reflected in the relatively high specific productivity, sRHA1 only started to accumulate significant amounts of isoquercitrin at the end of the exponential phase. This production start coincides with a reduction in specific growth rate, which dropped from 0.35 ± 0.04 to 0.06 ± 0.01 h −1 . As described in detail in the Background section, we previously metabolically engineered E. coli W to create a platform for in vivo glucosylation of small molecules [45] . In the original base glucosylation strain, sucrose phosphorylase encoded by BaSP was located on a mediumcopy plasmid and transcribed from a medium-strong constitutive promoter (P22) [50] . For reasons of comparison and flexibility, it was opted to integrate BaSP in the genome of E. coli W. In addition, chromosomal integration is advantageous because of a significant increase in gene stability. Since the level of gene expression can considerably be impacted by the genome integration site [51] due to structural differences such as supercoiling DNA regions, two different DNA sites were assessed for BaSP integration, i.e., melA and glgC, which encode an α-galactosidase and a glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase, respectively. To this end, an adapted knockin-knockout procedure for large DNA fragments was applied, which is schematically shown in Additional file 1: Figure S2 . BaSP under control of promoter P22 was knocked in at the two different loci in E. coli W ΔcscAR, which resulted in the E. coli W strains ΔcscAR ΔmelA::L4-P22-BaSP-L5 and ΔcscAR ΔglgC::L4-P22-BaSP-L5. Their maximal specific growth rate (µ max ) on minimal sucrose medium, which is shown in Fig. 3 , was compared to the original strain ΔcscAR + pBaSP. The influence of the knockin locus on the maximal specific growth rate is clear. Interestingly, integration at the melA locus resulted in a strain with a µ max which was not significantly different from the reference strain ΔcscAR + pBaSP.Question: What are the implications of the novel fermentation-based glycosylation strategy described in this study?","answer":"the economically viable production of various glycosides"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The present work involved the administration of both ethynyl estradiol and levonorgestrel to groups of rats, followed by determination of the homocysteine excretion rate in urine. The results indicate that a statistically significant difference exists between the excreted levels of homocysteine in the urine of both control and levonorgestrel-treated rats and the levels shown by rats treated with ethynyl estradiol. The implications of these results are discussed, especially with respect to observations which indicate that homocysteine may be a precipitating factor in the development of thrombosis. Also included in this paper is a study which confirms the identity of the HPLC peak as being homocysteine by forming a radioactive derivative of this particular sulphydryl-containing amino acid, and then analysing the resulting mixture by TLC.","answer":"{\\"Brand\\": [], \\"Drug\\": [\\"levonorgestrel\\", \\"ethynyl estradiol\\"], \\"DrugGroup\\": [\\"synthetic steroidal estrogen\\", \\"synthetic steroidal progestogen\\"], \\"UnapprovedDrug\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

This study aimed to identify risk factors associated with common chronic diseases among people aged 50 years and over in India. Data from Wave 1 of the 2007/2008 Indian Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) was used to investigate the association between lifestyle choices and chronic diseases using logistic regression. The fully adjusted model showed that significant independent risk factors for angina included area of residence, being diagnosed with diabetes, chronic lung disease (CLD) [highest odds ratio (OR) 4.77, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.95-7.70] and arthritis. For arthritis, risk factors included having underlying diabetes, CLD diagnosis, or angina (highest OR 2.32, 95% CI: 1.63-3.31). Risk factors associated with CLD included arthritis, angina (highest OR 4.76, 95% CI: 2.94-7.72), alcohol use, and tobacco use. Risk factors associated with diabetes included level of education, area of residence, socioeconomic status, angina (highest OR 3.59, 95% CI: 2.44-5.29), CLD, arthritis, stroke, and vegetable consumption. Finally, risk factors associated with stroke included diabetes and angina (highest OR 3.34, 95% CI: 1.72-6.50). The presence of any other comorbidity was significantly associated with all five chronic diseases studied. The results show that within the older population, the contribution of lifestyle risk factors to the common chronic diseases investigated in this study was limited. Our findings showed that the major health issue within the study population was multimorbidity.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"CLD\\", \\"chronic lung disease\\", \\"arthritis\\", \\"chronic diseases\\", \\"Chronic Diseases\\", \\"stroke\\", \\"diabetes\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"diagnosed\\", \\"level of education\\", \\"Risk factors\\", \\"Investigation\\", \\"issue\\", \\"diagnosis\\", \\"presence\\", \\"Risk Factors\\", \\"risk factors\\", \\"cause of death\\", \\"angina\\"], \\"Food\\": [\\"vegetable\\"], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [\\"model\\"], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [\\"people\\", \\"study population\\", \\"Older Population\\", \\"older population\\"], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health\\", \\"SAGE\\", \\"logistic regression\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"area\\", \\"Indian\\", \\"residence\\", \\"India\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

RATIONALE: There is substantial evidence that lisuride can produce effects linked to 5-HT (1A) receptor occupancy. Nevertheless, this action has generally been ignored in the mechanism of action of lisuride, in favor of an exclusive role for dopamine receptors in considering its antiparkinsonian effects, or an exclusive role of 5-HT (2A/2C) receptor activation in hallucinogenesis. These conclusions are surprising when one considers that the potent interaction of lisuride with 5-HT (1A) receptors has been demonstrated in several different laboratories and that activation of 5-HT (1A) and 5-HT (1B) receptors can modulate dopaminergically mediated responses. OBJECTIVE: The lack of full substitution of lisuride for lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in drug discrimination experiments and induction of a pronounced 5-HT syndrome by this compound at relatively low doses convinced us to execute two series of experiments that might explain the primary mechanism responsible for lisuride-mediated biological effects and its paradoxical classification as a dopamine agonist in the literature. RESULTS: In drug discrimination studies, lisuride fully mimicked the 5-HT (1A) agonist LY 293284, only partially substituted for LSD and DOI, and failed to substitute for (+) -amphetamine. Lisuride produced a significant dose-related increase in flat body posture, forepaw treading, and lower-lip retraction which reflect a modulation of behavior by action at central 5-HT (1A) receptors. Only pMPPI [ 4-iodo-N-[2-[4- (methoxyphenyl) -1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridynyl-benzamide hydrochloride ], a selective 5-HT (1A) antagonist, was effective in inhibiting all 5-HT syndrome behaviors produced by lisuride, whereas pMPPI was without effect on any behavior induced by LSD. Lisuride dose dependently decreased body temperature in rats with a potency similar to that of the selective 5-HT (1A) agonist LY 293284. The hypothermic effect of lisuride was prevented by pre-injection of pMPPI, but not by ketanserin or haloperidol. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that the behavioral effects of low doses of lisuride are clearly mediated by stimulation of 5-HT (1A) receptors.","answer":"[[\\"Lisuride\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"5-HT (1A\\"], [\\"lisuride\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"dopamine receptors\\"], [\\"4-iodo-N-[2-[4- (methoxyphenyl) -1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridynyl-benzamide hydrochloride\\", \\"ANTAGONIST\\", \\"5-HT (1A\\"], [\\"LY 293284\\", \\"AGONIST\\", \\"5-HT (1A\\"], [\\"lisuride\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"5-HT (1A\\"], [\\"lisuride\\", \\"REGULATOR\\", \\"5-HT (1A\\"], [\\"lisuride\\", \\"AGONIST\\", \\"5-HT (1A\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

We investigated the influence of SLCO1B1 polymorphism on cholesterol synthesis and absorption during baseline, and as affected by statins. In a crossover study, 32 healthy volunteers with different SLCO1B1 genotypes ingested a single dose of fluvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, and atorvastatin. Plasma total cholesterol, and cholesterol synthesis and absorption markers were measured before statin administration and up to 12 h thereafter. The mean fasting baseline plasma desmosterol to cholesterol ratio was 40% higher in participants with the SLCO1B1 c.521CC variant genotype than in those with the c.521TT genotype (P=0.043). The genotype had no significant effect on cholesterol absorption markers. All statins decreased lathosterol and avenasterol to cholesterol ratios, but no significant differences in the response existed between SLCO1B1 genotypes. In conclusion, the low activity SLCO1B1 c.521CC genotype is associated with an increased cholesterol synthesis rate.

The interaction of the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (-)-reboxetine with the human α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in different conformational states was studied by several functional and structural approaches. Patch-clamp and Ca(2+)-influx results indicate that (-)-reboxetine does not activate hα4β2 nAChRs via interaction with the orthosteric sites, but inhibits agonist-induced hα4β2 activation by a noncompetitive mechanism. Consistently, the results from the electrophysiology-based functional approach suggest that (-)-reboxetine may act via open channel block; therefore, it is capable of producing a use-dependent type of inhibition of the hα4β2 nAChR function. We tested whether (-)-reboxetine binds to the luminal [(3)H]imipramine site. The results indicate that, although (-)-reboxetine binds with low affinity to this site, it discriminates between the resting and desensitized hα4β2 nAChR ion channels. Patch-clamp results also indicate that (-)-reboxetine progressively inhibits the hα4β2 nAChR with two-fold higher potency at the end of one-second application of agonist, compared with the peak current. The molecular docking studies show that (-)-reboxetine blocks the ion channel at the level of the imipramine locus, between M2 rings 6' and 14'. In addition, we found a (-)-reboxetine conformer that docks in the helix bundle of the α4 subunit, near the middle region. According to molecular dynamics simulations, (-)-reboxetine binding is stable for both sites, albeit less stable than imipramine. The interaction of these drugs with the helix bundle might alter allostericaly the functionality of the channel. In conclusion, the clinical action of (-)-reboxetine may be produced (at least partially) by its inhibitory action on hα4β2 nAChRs.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"[(3)H]imipramine\\", \\"imipramine\\", \\"(-)-reboxetine\\", \\"acetylcholine\\", \\"norepinephrine\\", \\"Ca(2+)\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research article.

This study is a systematic literature review, evaluating exemestane in different clinical settings. The Ovid Medline (1948-2012), Embase (1980-2012), and Web of Science (1899-2012) databases were searched. Forty-two relevant articles covering randomized controlled trials were reviewed for efficacy and safety, and three for adherence. With regard to efficacy in metastatic disease , exemestane is superior to megestrol acetate after progression on tamoxifen . There is evidence for noninferiority to fulvestrant (following a prior aromatase inhibitor) and to nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors in the first-line setting. Combined use with everolimus is shown to be more efficacious than exemestane alone following previous aromatase inhibitor use. In the adjuvant setting, a switch to exemestane after 2-3 years of tamoxifen is superior to 5 years of tamoxifen. exemestane is noninferior to 5 years of tamoxifen as upfront therapy, and may have a role as an extended adjuvant therapy. Used as neoadjuvant therapy, increased breast conservation is achievable. As chemoprevention, exemestane significantly reduces the incidence of breast cancer in \\"at-risk\\" postmenopausal women. exemestane is associated with myalgias and arthralgias, as well as reduced bone mineral density and increased risk of fracture, which do not appear to persist at follow-up, with subsequent return to pretreatment values. Compared with tamoxifen, there is a reduced incidence of endometrial changes, thromboembolic events, and hot flashes. Limited evidence shows nonadherence in 23%-32% of patients. Evidence is growing in support of exemestane in all clinical settings. It is generally more efficacious and has a better safety profile than tamoxifen. How it compares with the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors remains to be established. Further studies are required on adherence to ensure that maximum benefit is obtained.sentence: With regard to efficacy in metastatic disease , exemestane is superior to megestrol acetate after progression on tamoxifen .","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Among these subsets, Th1 cells are known to activate cellular immunity resulting in inflammatory response, whereas Th2 cells induce humoral and allergic responses and suppress inflammation. Th1 and Th2 effector functions and their development are attributable to their distinct cytokine expression patterns. Recent reports have demonstrated that differential expression of cell surface molecules, such as adhesion molecule and chemokine receptor, is involved in their recruitment into target tissues. It is, therefore, suggested that clarification of the mechanisms of differential gene expression in Th1 / Th2 should lead to rational strategies for manipulating pathological immune responses. Activation of helper T cells mediated by the T cell receptor induces a series of biochemical events. Among them, both the activation of PKC / Ras-and CaM / CN-mediated pathways play a central role in the signal transduction of cytokine gene expression. Closer examination using non-transformed murine Th1 and Th2 clones suggested that a balance between the activities of the two signaling pathways contributes to cytokine gene expression. We propose that one of the targets of PGE2, whose effect distinguishes Th1 from Th2, resides in the downstream PKC / Ras-mediated pathway.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"Th2 cells\\", \\"non - transformed murine Th1 and Th2 clones\\", \\"Th1\\", \\"Th2\\", \\"Th1 / Th2\\", \\"Th1 cells\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"helper T cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"cytokine gene\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"antigens\\", \\"PKC / Ras\\", \\"adhesion molecule\\", \\"cytokine\\", \\"chemokine receptor\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

( [ eq : model ] ) represents global ( all - to - all ) coupling with equal coupling strength @xmath8 .  the sine coupling form is the most general representation of the coupling in the lowest order of the complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) description@xcite , and its periodic nature is generic in limit - cycle oscillator systems .  we consider the ferromagnetic coupling ( @xmath9 ) , so the neighboring oscillators favor their phase difference being minimized .  the scattered natural frequencies and the coupling of the oscillators compete with each other .  when the coupling becomes strong enough to overcome the dispersion of natural frequencies , macroscopic regions in which the oscillators are synchronized by sharing a coupling - modified common frequency @xmath10 may emerge .     collective phase synchronization is conveniently described by the complex order parameter defined by @xmath11 where the amplitude @xmath12 measures the phase synchronization and @xmath13 indicates the average phase .  when the coupling is weak , each oscillator tends to evolve with its own natural frequency , resulting in the fully random desynchronized phase ( @xmath14 ) . as the coupling increases  , some oscillators with @xmath15 become synchronized , and their phases @xmath16 start to show some ordering ( @xmath17 ) .     equation  ( [ eq : model ] ) can be simplified to @xmath18 decoupled equations @xmath19 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are to be determined by imposing self - consistency . in the steady state ( @xmath20 ) , the self - consistency equation reads @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23  @xcite .  this equation has a nontrivial solution only when @xmath24 : @xmath25 with @xmath26 .  we note that the exponent @xmath26 corresponds to the mean field ( mf ) value for systems of locally coupled oscillators  @xcite .     now , we perform numerical integrations of eq .   ( [ eq : model ] ) by using heun s method  @xcite for various system sizes of @xmath27 to @xmath28 . for a given distribution of disorder @xmath29  , we average over time in the steady state after some transient time . after the time average  , we also average over disorder .  typically , we take the time step @xmath30 , the maximum number of time steps @xmath31 , and the number of samples @xmath32 . for convenience ,  we set @xmath33 ( unit variance ) ; then , the corresponding critical parameter value is @xmath34 .     figure  [ fig : gl_m ] shows the behavior of the phase synchronization order parameter @xmath12 against the coupling strength @xmath35 for various system sizes @xmath18 . in the weak coupling region ( @xmath36 )  , we find that the order parameter approaches zero as @xmath37 , which is a characteristic of the fully random phase . in the strong coupling region @xmath38 ,  @xmath12 saturates to a finite value , indicating a phase transition at @xmath39 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath40 , which is consistent with the analytic result .    to pin down the transition point @xmath41  precisely , we use the binder cumulant method  @xcite .  the fourth - order cumulant of the order parameter , the binder cumulant ( bc ) , is defined in thermal systems as @xmath42}{3[langle delta^2   rangle]^2 } b_{delta } =   1-frac{langle delta^4 rangle } { 3langle delta^2   rangle^2 } , label{eq : gl_bm} ] ] where @xmath43 represents the thermal ( time ) average . in systems with quenched disorder ,  on the other hand , we should consider the disorder average besides the thermal one .  we may first consider the bc as the disorder - averaged moment ratio  @xcite @xmath44}{3[langle delta^2 rangle]^2 } , label{eq : gl_bm_old} ] ] where @xmath45  ] denotes the disorder average , i.e. , the average over different realizations of @xmath29 .     figure  [ fig : gl_bm_old ] displays @xmath46 as a function of the coupling strength @xmath35 for various system sizes @xmath18 . in the region of weak coupling @xmath47 , we expect the random nature of the oscillator phases @xmath48 to yield an asymmetric poisson - like probability distribution function ( pdf ) characterized by @xmath49 with a constant @xmath50 , which leads to @xmath51 . on the other hand , in the strong - coupling region ,  the pdf becomes a @xmath52-like function with a very narrow variance , which leads to @xmath53 .  the numerical data in fig .   2 are consistent with our predictions  .    however , near the transition , the @xmath46 shows a big anomalous _  dip \\" _ on the desynchronized side . as the system size increases , the dip develops initially with a broad width and then becomes sharper and also deeper .  the dip s position moves toward the transition point .  the crossing points seem to nicely converge to the critical point @xmath54 . however , as the system size increases , the presence of the dip starts to hinder us in locating the critical point accurately .    in this letter , we explain why the dip develops in this system and propose alternative definitions of the binder cumulant that do not show any dip in the same system .  we measure the disorder ( sample - to - sample ) fluctuations defined as @xmath55}{[langle{cal o}rangle]^2}-1 , label{eq : a} ] ] where @xmath56 is any observable , such as @xmath12 and @xmath57 , in a system .  this quantity is positive definite and is supposed to vanish in the thermodynamic limit in _ self - averaging _ systems and to remain finite in non - self - averaging systems  @xcite . as one can see in fig .   [ fig : gl_a ] , the disorder fluctuation @xmath58 is quite sizable in the range of @xmath35 where the dip appears ( @xmath59 shows a similar behavior ) .  in other words , the @xmath46 shows a dip where the system is not well self - averaged .  a careful finite - size analysis on @xmath58 reveals that it vanishes as @xmath60 away from criticality , but saturates to a finite value at criticality .  the non - self - averageness at criticality is not surprising because the quenched randomness in natural frequencies should be relevant at this transition .     strong disorder fluctuations may cause non - negligible spreading of the _ effective _ coupling constants over different realizations of disorder  @xcite .  figure  [ fig : pdf ] shows for 20 independent samples , the pdf of @xmath12 just below the transition and obtained from the time series of @xmath12 after the system had reached the steady state .  indeed , a large part of the sample - to - sample variations can be interpreted as a shift in the @xmath41 of individual samples .  the two quantities @xmath61} ] and @xmath62  ] in eq .  ( [ eq : gl_bm_old ] ) can be considered as the second and the fourth moments of the disorder - averaged pdf , which is much broader than the individual pdfs near the transition .  one can easily see that broadening yields a larger value for the ratio @xmath62/[langledelta^2rangle]^2  ] and , hence , a smaller bc .  the effect is particularly pronounced on the small @xmath35 side of the transition , where @xmath12 itself is small , in which case a shift in @xmath41 has a stronger influence on the moments .     an alternative definition for the binder cumulant for systems with quenched disorder ( especially non - diminishing disorder fluctuations ) is@xcite @xmath63 .  label{eq : gl_bm_new} ] ] we note that the disorder average is performed over the ratio of the time - averaged moments .  the moment ratio is calculated for each sample first and , is then averaged over disorder .  it is clear that this definition of the binder cumulant should eliminate the most dominant contribution from the disorder fluctuations , i.e. ,  the anomaly caused by the spreading of the effective coupling constants .  this definition has been adopted mostly in quantum disorder systems , where strong disorder fluctuations are anticipated  @xcite .  figure  [ fig : gl_bm_new ] displays @xmath64 versus @xmath35 .  we note that the dip shown in fig .   [ fig : gl_bm_old ] disappears and that the crossing points nicely converge to @xmath41 , implying that @xmath64 should serve better for locating the transition point than the conventional one , which is confirmed numerically ( not shown here ) .     yet another definition of the binder cumulant is @xmath65}{3[langle delta^2 rangle^2]}. label{eq : gl_bm_newer} ] ] we expect that @xmath66 may also behave smoothly near the transition because it does not involve disorder fluctuation terms such as @xmath45 ^ 2  ] included in @xmath46 .  figure  [ fig : gl_bm_newer ] displays @xmath67 versus @xmath35 .  as expected , we find no anomalous behavior in @xmath66 .  we can directly relate @xmath46 and @xmath66 through the disorder fluctuation @xmath58 .  simple algebra leads to @xmath68 as the disorder fluctuation @xmath58 becomes larger , @xmath69 shows a bigger dip .  this explains quantitatively the size and the location of the dip in @xmath69 .  the critical value of @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) provides additional information on the temporal variations of @xmath12 .  one can show that @xmath72/[langledelta^2rangle^2] ] , where @xmath73 .  our numerical result indicates that the relative temporal fluctuations are almost negligible even at criticality . in this case  , @xmath70 is not practically useful in locating the transition point accurately .    in summary , we studied binder cumulants in the quenched disorder system . for the kuramoto model  , we found that the conventionally defined bc shows a big anomalous dip near the transition .  this dip is shown to be directly related to the disorder fluctuation ( non - self - averageness ) .  alternative definitions of the bc , which did not show any anomalous behavior were proposed and may be useful in locating the transition point accurately in general systems with quenched disorder ."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

IL-10 affects monocytes and T cells by driving the progression of immune responsiveness such that Th2 lymphocyte-mediated effects predominate. In this report, we show that in monocytes and T cells IL-10 stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription, STAT1 alpha and STAT3, in a differential manner such that the relative formation of homo-and hetero dimers varies between the two cell types. Moreover, monocytes express a novel IL-10-stimulated STAT protein with an M (r) of 70 kDa that is recognized by the anti-STAT3 Ab but is not observed in T cells. IL-10 treatment of both T cells and monocytes results in the ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of tyk2 and Jak1, but not Jak2 or Jak3. Selective modulation of immune responsiveness by IL-10 in cells such as monocytes and T cells may result in part from the differential activation of STAT protein pairs.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [], \\"CellType\\": [\\"human T cells\\", \\"monocytes\\", \\"T cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [], \\"Protein\\": [\\"homo - and hetero dimers\\", \\"tyk2\\", \\"STAT3 complexes\\", \\"STAT3\\", \\"IL - 10 - stimulated STAT protein\\", \\"signal transducers\\", \\"STAT1 alpha\\", \\"Jak1\\", \\"IL - 10\\", \\"70 kDa\\", \\"Jak3\\", \\"activators of transcription\\", \\"Jak2\\", \\"anti - STAT3 Ab\\", \\"STAT protein pairs\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

Enveloped viruses are most commonly known to cause emerging and recurring infectious diseases. Viral and cell membrane fusion is the major key event in case of enveloped viruses that required for their entry into the cell. Viral fusion proteins are playing important role in fusion process and in infection establishment. Because of this, fusion process targeting antivirals become an interest to fight against viral diseases caused by enveloped virus. Lower respiratory tract infections casing viruses like influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) are examples of such enveloped viruses that are at top in public health issues. Here, we summarized the viral fusion protein targeted antiviral peptides along with their mechanism and specific design to combat viral fusion process. The pandemic COVID-19, severe respiratory syndrome disease is outbreak worldwide. There are no definitive drugs yet but few are in on-going trial. Here, an approach of fragment based drug design (FBDD) methodology was used to identify the broad spectrum agent target to the conserved region of fusion protein of SARS CoV-2. Three dipeptides (DL, LQ and ID) were chosen from the library and designed by the systematic combination along with their possible modifications of amino acids to the target sites. Designed peptides were docked with targeted fusion protein after energy minimization. Results show strong and significant binding affinity (DL = -60.1 kcal/mol; LQ = -62.8 kcal/mol; ID= -71.5 kcal/mol) during interaction. Any one of the active peptides from the developed libraries may help to block competitively the target sites to successfully control COVID-19.","answer":"[\\"Treatment\\", \\"Mechanism\\"]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

fabian this volume ) .the low energy ( below 10 kev ) xrb spectrum has been measured with the imaging detectors onboard rosat , asca , and bepposax and a summary of the results is given in figure 1 together with a compilation of recent re  analysis of the heao1 a2 and a4 experiments data .the comparison between the different datasets in the overlapping @xmath0 18 kev energy range points to a systematic difference in the normalization of the xrb flux while the average spectrum is similar among all the observations .the largest deviation is of the order of @xmath0 40 % between the heao1 a2 and bepposax data ( see vecchi et al .1999 for a more detailed discussion ) .such a discrepancy could be due to residual , not fully understood , cross  calibration errors among the different detectors and/or to field  to  field fluctuations .these findings cast shadows on the intensity and the location of the xrb peak as measured by heao1 a2 ( @xmath0 43 kev @xmath1 s@xmath2 sr@xmath2 at 30 kev ; gruber et al .indeed a simple extrapolation of the bepposax and heao1 a4 med best fit spectra imply that the xrb spectrum peaks at @xmath0 23 kev with a much higher intensity introducing an extra  degree of freedom in agn models parameter space . a new measurement of the 10100 kev spectrum would be extremely important .unfortunately such observations are not foreseen in the near future .as far as the model of the xrb is concerned , the most important parameters to deal with are a good estimate of the average continuum slope and of the absorption column density .the broad  band energy range exploited by bepposax turned out to be extremely useful to probe column densities as high as 10@xmath3 @xmath1 , to assess the strength of the reflection component which peaks around 2030 kev , and the shape of the low  energy soft  excess emission below @xmath0 1 kev .in addition asca observations of sizeable samples of relatively faint agns have allowed to probe the spectral properties of high  luminosity high redshift objects .the most important new results emerging from these observations can be summarized as follows :    -1 cm    @xmath4 the fraction of heavily obscured ( 24 @xmath5 log @xmath6 @xmath5 25 ) and compton thick ( log @xmath7 25 ) sources in the local universe is much higher than previously thought ( risaliti , maiolino & salvati 1999 ) and a fraction as high as 50% of the seyfert 2 in the local universe could be obscured by these large column densities .@xmath4 soft excess emission is uncommon among bright seyfert 1 galaxies ( matt this volume ) and nearby quasars ( george et al .2000 ) and estimated to be present in less than @xmath0 30 % of agn .@xmath4 first observations of high redshift quasars suggest a flattening of the power law slope which can not be ascribed to the reflection component ( vignali et al .1999 ) .@xmath4 despite intensive searches for high luminosity highly absorbed objects ( the so  called type 2 quasars ) these sources appear to be elusive and only a few bona  fide examples have been reported in the literature ( i.e. barcons et al .1998 ; georgantopoulos et al . 1999 ) .the evolution of the agn xlf has been extensively studied mainly in the soft x rays and usually parametrized with a pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) model ( i.e. boyle et al 1994 ) . a major step forward in the determination of the soft xlf has been recently achieved by miyaji et al .( 2000 ) . combining the results of several rosat surveys it has been possible to explore the low - luminosity high - redshift tail of the xlf in much greater detail than before .the results favour a luminosity dependent density evolution ( ldde ) as the best description of the available data . in agreement with previous studies ,x - ray selected agn undergo strong evolution up to a redshift @xmath8 = 1.52.0 and a levelling  off or a weak negative evolution up to @xmath9 45 .two parametric descriptions ( ldde1 and ldde2 ) encompassing the statistically acceptable fits to the soft xlf have been worked out by miyaji and collaborators .the integration of the ldde1 and ldde2 xlf up to @xmath10 5 accounts for about 60 % and 90 % of the soft xrb respectively .before discussing and comparing the various models , it is important to stress the strong coupling between the input spectral parameters and those describing the xlf evolution , which instead are often uncorrectly considered to be independent in the models . indeedthe x  ray luminosities are usually computed converting count rates into fluxes assuming a single valued ( relatively steep ) slope .this procedure might easily lead to a wrong estimate of the intrinsic luminosity for a very hard absorbed spectrum or if the soft x  ray flux is due to a component not directly related to the obscured nucleus ( as in the case of a thermal spectrum from a starburst or scattered emission ) . according with the xrb baseline model ,absorbed agn become progressively more important towards faint fluxes and thus an additional spurious density evolution term can be introduced in the derivation of the xlf .it turns out that not only the evolution and the space density of obscured agn are highly uncertain , but also the common practice to consider the soft xlf as representative of the properties of type 1 objects is likely to contain major uncertainties especially when extrapolated to higher energies .unfortunately our present knowledge of the agn spectral and evolutive properties does not allow to disentangle the spectral and evolutionary parameters , leaving this ambiguity in all the xrb synthesis models .the baseline model ( cfr @xmath11 1 ) has been recently extended , taking into account some of the new observational findings described in @xmath112 , by several authors : gilli , risaliti & salvati 1999 ( grs99 ) ; miyaji , hasinger & schmidt 1999 ( mhs99 ) ; wilman & fabian 1999 ( wf99 ) ; pompilio , la franca & matt 2000 ( plm00 ) .a good agreement among the various models has been reached on the high energy cut  off in the input spectrum ( 300500 kev ) , which is basically fixed by the xrb shape above 40 kev ( comastri 1999 ) , and on the @xmath8 and @xmath12 values .grs99 and mhs99 adopted the ldde model for the evolution of the xlf and also introduced a cut  off in the luminosity distribution of absorbed agn for @xmath13 10@xmath14 erg s@xmath2 to cope with the lack of type 2 qso .the absorption distribution has been fixed according to the recent bepposax results only in the grs99 model . plm00 and wf99 both stressed that a proper treatement of the high energy spectrum of heavily obscured ( 24 @xmath5 log@xmath6 @xmath5 25 ) objects has important consequences for the modelling .in particular the evolution of the obscured to unobscured ratio as a function of redshift ( plm00 ) or the need of super  solar abundances to better fit the xrb peak at 30 kev ( wf99 ; but see @xmath11 2.1 ) have been invoked .         the expected contribution of agn to the 210 kev xrbis reported in table 2 as a function of flux .the model parameters are such to account for an intensity of @xmath0 7 @xmath15 10@xmath16 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 sr@xmath2 ( in between the asca and bepposax measurements ) at @xmath0 10@xmath17 cgs .the predictions are model dependent and should be considered as indicative .nevertheless it is clear that at the fluxes sampled by the foreseen chandra and xmm medium deep surveys most of the xrb will be resolved allowing to unveil the nature of the sources making the bulk of its energy density .the most important challenge for xrb models will be the study of x  ray absorption and luminosity distribution for 210 kev fluxes @xmath5 10@xmath18 cgs , the search for heavily obscured agn which according to the predictions are expected to show up in a substantial fraction below @xmath5 10@xmath19 cgs ( cfr . fig .3 ) , and the optical  infrared follow  up of x  ray obscured sources .","answer":"the origin of the hard x  ray background ( xrb ) as a superposition of unabsorbed and absorbed active galactic nuclei is now widely accepted as the standard model .  the identification of faint x   ray sources in rosat , asca , and bepposax medium  deep surveys and their average spectral properties are in broad agreement with the model predictions .  however , agn models , at least in their simplified version , seem to be at odds with some of the most recent findings calling for substantial revisions .  i will review the recent xrb  best fit \\" models and discuss how the foreseen xmm and chandra surveys will be able to constrain the allowed parameter space ."},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

In 1997, 150 women were randomized to either retaining their entire antenatal record through pregnancy (women-held group) or to holding a small, abbreviated card, as was standard practice (control group). A questionnaire was distributed to women to measure sense of control, involvement in care and levels of communication. Availability of records at antenatal visits was also measured. Women in both groups were satisfied with their allocated method of record keeping, however, those in the women-held group were significantly more likely to report feeling in 'control' during pregnancy. Women in the control group were more likely to feel anxious and helpless and less likely to have information on their records explained to them by their caregiver. The number of records available at each clinic was similar in both groups.Title 2:The Newbury Maternity Care Study: a randomized controlled trial to assess a policy of women holding their own obstetric records.Abstract 2:To assess a policy of women holding and thus having constant access to their own obstetric records, 290 women attending a peripheral consultant clinic in Newbury, West Berkshire, were randomly allocated to hold either their full case notes, or the more usual co-operation card. Women holding their full records were significantly more likely to feel in control of their antenatal care (rate ratio 1.45; 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.95) and to feel it was easier to talk to doctors and midwives (rate ratio 1.73; 95% confidence interval 1.16-2.59). No other beneficial effects were detected. Asked about their preferences for any subsequent pregnancies, women holding their own records in the index pregnancy were more likely to say they would prefer to hold the same kind of record again in a subsequent pregnancy than were women holding a co-operation card (rate ratio 1.56; 95% confidence interval 1.34-1.81). There was no evidence of negative effects. In particular, women holding their case notes did not feel more anxious than co-operation card holders. The policy of women holding their notes resulted in savings in clerical time, without evidence of an increase in the rate of lost notes.","answer":"The three trials are small, and not all of them reported on all outcomes. The results suggest that there are both potential benefits (increased maternal control and satisfaction during pregnancy, increased availability of antenatal records during hospital attendance) and harms (more operative deliveries). Importantly, all of the trials report that more women in the case notes group would prefer to hold their antenatal records in another pregnancy. There is insufficient evidence on health related behaviours (smoking and breastfeeding) and clinical outcomes. It is important to emphasise that this review shows a lack of evidence of benefit rather than evidence of no benefit."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

up after 1 month .in the event of a traumatic acute intracranial bleed , the highest priority is to evacuate the accumulating hematoma and achieve hemostasis while maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion .this is because rising icp reduces cerebral blood flow and leads to irreversible brain damage and even death .there was a need to match the diuresis with an unanticipated amount of isotonic fluid ( 400 ml of hartmann 's in this case ) to maintain a favorable cardiovascular physiology under anesthesia .irrespective of the advocated reduced crystalloid use in head trauma , the proactive use of hartmann 's solution was prudent retrospectively in this child as it was isosmotic and countered the excessive loss of potassium expected with the subsequent diuresis .isotonic hartmann 's solution also prevented worsening of cerebral edema through a reverse osmotic process .its treatment includes bicarbonate . in this context too , hartmann 's solution as a replacement fluid was more appropriate , as in the presence of normal liver function , its lactate would be converted to hco3 ., we noted that the overdose of hs occurred following infusion of a 300 ml 3% solution bag directly connected to the patient without an intervening mechanism such as a burette or a programed pump to limit it at 30 ml .a clinical status with blue - mottled skin and cold peripheries simulates septic shock even with normal blood pressure and core temperature . in this child , this clinical feature may have resulted from hyperosmolar circulation leading to reduced extravascular fluids and  shrunk  skin .the end result was a sluggish skin circulation leading to a pale , mottled , blue skin .osmotherapy constitutes the cornerstone of medical therapy of cerebral edema irrespective of the etiology of brain injury , and hs is superior to mannitol .hs , in combination with colloid , has been used in europe for trauma resuscitation for many years .even small amounts of hs induce a relevant fluid shift from the extravascular space into the intravascular space .this was the principle of  small -

Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: The pooled analysis of two studies conducted in 153 children and 203 adults revealed that patients infected with any respiratory virus, who were intranasally treated with iota-carrageenan showed a 1.9 day faster recovery from common cold symptoms than placebo treated patients in the intention-to-treat population  [41, 42] . The anti-influenza activity was shown by subgroup analysis of 49 influenza infected patients who benefited from a 3.3 days faster recovery from symptoms. The use of carrageenan nasal spray was associated with a significant reduction of the influenza viral load in nasal fluids and a significant increase in the number of virus free patients within the treatment period of 7 days. In good accordance Prieschl-Grassauer are co-founders of Marinomed Biotechnologie GmbH. Marinomed Biotechnologie GmbH had a role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, preparation of the manuscript and is financing the processing charge of the manuscript. with the literature [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] we observed that the majority of influenza virus infected patients suffered from a concomitant respiratory viral infection (66%) as determined by real-time PCR. Carrageenan containing nasal sprays are already marketed for the treatment of respiratory viral infections under different brand names in 18 countries. At present the only available effective drugs for treatment and post exposure prevention of influenza are the NI (Oseltamivir and Zanamivir worldwide; Peramivir in Japan and South Korea). Since the large-scale use of M2 blockers for prophylaxis and treatment in humans [43] and farming [44] , the currently circulating influenza viruses already lack sensitivity to this drug group [45] . We have already shown an additive therapeutic effect of a combination therapy with intranasally applied iota-carrageenan and orally administered Oseltamivir in lethally H1N1 A/PR/ 8/34 infected mice and a treatment start 48 hours post infection (hpi) [37] . Due to these very promising results we further developed the concept of combining carrageenan with an NI therapy. In contrast to Oseltamivir, which needs to be activated by metabolic conversion, Zanamivir is directly applied as active drug and can also be administered intranasally [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . The potential of an intranasal administration of Zanamivir was investigated by GlaxoSmithKline. In seven clinical challenge trials 66 volunteers were infected with influenza B/Yamagata/16/88 and 213 with influenza A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1). 156 of these participants got intranasally applied Zanamivir at different doses (daily dose levels from 6.4 mg to 96 mg) for prophylaxis or therapy [46, 47, 53, 54] . These challenge trials showed that treatment starting before and up to 36 hours post virus inoculation was associated with prevention of laboratory confirmed influenza and febrile illness as well as a reduction in viral titers, duration of shedding and symptoms. In total, safety data from 1092 patients after intranasal application of Zanamivir were published and no evidence for Zanamivir induced adverse events or increased frequencies of local nasal intolerance in comparison to placebo groups was found [46, 49, 52] . Taken together, the combination of a carrageenan nasal spray that provides broad antiviral activity against upper respiratory infections-including influenza-with Zanamivir, a specific anti-influenza drug, meets the existing medical need to treat multiple viral infections. In the present work we investigate the therapeutic effect of a combination of carrageenan and Zanamivir in-vitro and in an animal model. Kappa-carrageenan and iota-carrageenan were purchased from FMC Biopolymers (Philadelphia, PA). The identity, purity (>95%) of carrageenan subtypes and the molecular weight (>100,000) was confirmed by NMR analysis as described elsewhere [55] and the presence of lambda-carrageenan was below the detection limit of 3%. The dry polymer powders were dissolved in aqua bidest (Fresenius Kabi, Austria) to a final concentration of 2.4 mg/ml iota-and 0.8 mg/ml kappa-carrageenan. This 2x stock solution was sterile filtered through a 0.22 μm filter (PAA, Switzerland) and stored at room temperature until use. For further testing the stock solution was diluted to a mixture containing 1.2 mg/ml iota-carrageenan and 0.4 mg/ml kappa-carrageenan (hereinafter referred to as \\"carrageenan\\"). Zanamivir was purchased as powder (Haosun Pharma, China) and the identity and purity was confirmed by NMR analysis. Zanamivir was either dissolved in carrageenan or placebo solutions, followed by sterile filtration through a 0.22 μm filter (Sarstedt, Germany). For in-vivo studies all Zanamivir containing solutions were freshly prepared. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and cultivated in a 37°C incubator (Sanyo, Japan; CO 2 : 5%, relative humidity: >95%). MDCK cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential (DMEM) high glucose medium (PAA, Austria) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAA, Austria; heat inactivated). Influenza virus A/Hansa Hamburg/01/09 (H1N1(09)pdm) was kindly provided by Peter Staeheli Department of Virology, University of Freiburg, Germany and previously described in [56] ; A/Teal/Germany/Wv632/05 (H5N1) previously published in [57] (accession numbers CY061882-9) and A/Turkey/Germany/R11/01 (H7N7) (taxonomy ID 278191, accession number AEZ68716) were supplied by courtesy of Martin Beer, Institute of Diagnostic Virology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, Riems, Germany; A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) was purchased from the ATCC. All influenza viruses were propagated in MDCK cells at 37°C and 5% CO 2 in influenza medium [Opti-Pro serum free medium (Gibco, Austria) supplemented with 4 mM L-glutamine (PAA, Austria), 1% antibiotic-antimycotic mix (PAA, Austria) and 5 μg/ml trypsin (Sigma Aldrich, Austria)]. To determine the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) and the combination effect of carrageenan and Zanamivir, a semi-liquid plaque assay was developed. Into 96 well tissue culture plates 1.7x10 4 MDCK cells/well were seeded and infected at 90% confluence (24-28 hours later). Serial dilutions of carrageenan and Zanamivir were prepared in assay medium (influenza medium without trypsin). For infection, viruses were diluted to an MOI of 0.003 (H1N1(09)pdm and H3N2 Aichi), 0.015 (H5N1) or 0.004 (H7N7), respectively, in assay medium and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 10 min with the serial dilutions of carrageenan and/or Zanamivir, respectively. For evaluation of the combination effect of carrageenan and Zanamivir, viruses were diluted in assay medium containing constant concentrations of either carrageenan or Zanamivir. The other substance was serially diluted and used for virus incubation. Cells were infected in 6 replicates/compound dilution, respectively, and incubated at RT for 45 min before inoculum removal. Cells were further incubated with the respective concentration of the investigated substances present in the overlay [influenza medium with 2.25% Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC, Fluka, Austria)] for 30-42 hours at 37°C. Evolving plaques were evaluated after methanol/acetone cell fixation by immune staining with antibodies either directed against the influenza A nucleoprotein (AbD Serotec, Germany) (for H1N1(09)pdm, H5N1 and H7N7) or the hemagglutinin (AbD Serotec, Germany) (for H3N2). Analysis was done with a HRP labeled detection antibody (Thermo Scientific, Germany) using TMB (Biolegend, Germany) as substrate and a microplate reader at 450 nm. The reduction of detected signal represents a reduction in the number and size of plaques and indicates suppression of viral replication during infection and cultivation. After the immunostaining cells were stained with 0.005% crystal violet solution to assess the condition of the cell layer and the toxicity of the compounds. IC 50 values and standard deviations were calculated for a sigmoidal dose response model using XLfit Excel add-in version 5.3.1.3. All animal experiments were carried out according to the guidelines of the \\"European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes\\" and the Austrian law for animal experiments. All animal experiments were approved by the Veterinary University of Vienna institutional ethics committee and performed under the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science and Research experimental animal license numbers BMWF-68.205/0262-II/3b/2011 and BMWF-68.205/0142-II/3b2012. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Janvier Labs, France and maintained under standard laboratory conditions in the animal facilities of the Veterinary University of Vienna. For euthanasia and anesthesia asphyxiation through CO 2 was used and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. For infection experiments, 3-5 weeks old female mice were intranasally inoculated with 50 μl influenza virus solution (25 μl/nostril) containing 2.27x10 3 or 1.65x10 3 plaque-forming unit of H1N1(09)pdm or H7N7, respectively. Subsequently, treatment started 24, 48 or 72 hpi, as indicated for the different experiments. Treatment was performed intranasally either with 50 μl therapeutic solution or placebo twice per day for 5 days. As therapy either carrageenan (containing 1.2 mg/ml iota-carrageenan and 0.4 mg/ml kappa-carrageenan to provide a daily dose of 12 mg/kg body weight (BW)), Zanamivir (containing either 130 μg/ml or 390 μg/ml Zanamivir, to provide a daily dose of 1 or 3 mg/kg BW, respectively) or a combination of carrageenan and Zanamivir were used. Carrageenan and Zanamivir are used at non-toxic concentrations as shown by [58] and [59] . Mice were monitored twice daily for 15 days for survival and weight loss. Mortality also includes mice that were sacrificed for ethical considerations when they had lost more than 25% of their initial body weight. We confirm the viral infection in these animals by necropsy and scoring of the lung inflammation. As the mechanisms underlying the antiviral activity of NI and carrageenans are fundamentally distinct, they are likely to exhibit different activities towards the individual influenza virus strains. As a result, in combination they could complement each other to provide protection against a broader spectrum of influenza virus strains than the individual compounds. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the sensitivity of various influenza virus strains to Zanamivir and carrageenan in an adapted plaque reduction assay with semi-liquid overlay in MDCK cells [60, 61] . Using this method, we determined the IC 50 of Zanamivir and carrageenan against influenza A viruses of human and animal origin, namely H1N1(09)pdm (A/Hansa Hamburg/01/09), H3N2 (A/Aichi/2/68), low pathogenic (LP) H5N1 (A/Teal/Germany/ Wv632/05) and LP H7N7 (A/Turkey/Germany/R11/01) ( Table 1) . Both substances were nontoxic at the highest tested concentration (400 μM Zanamivir and 533 μg/ml carrageenan), neither was their combination. Furthermore, CMC in the overlay did not show any virus inhibitory effect (data not shown). Inhibition of viral replication of all tested influenza strains was achieved with both substances. However, the IC 50 values varied widely depending on the influenza virus strain. The IC 50 values of Zanamivir ranged between 0.18 μM for H5N1 and 22.97 μM for H7N7 and that of carrageenan from 0.39 μg/ml to 118.48 μg/ml for H1N1(09)pdm and H7N7, respectively (see Table 1 ). These results demonstrate that carrageenan and Zanamivir target individual influenza strains to different extents so that they may complement each other to provide broader anti-influenza activity. The type of compound interaction was characterized by employing isobolograms (Fig 1) . As described in [62] , isobolograms graphically compare the doses of two compounds needed to reach 50% inhibition to the predicted doses calculated based on a model of drug additivity. A curve linearity of~1 is expected for an additive compound interaction whereas a curve progression <1 argue for synergistic and >1 for an antagonistic compound interaction. Two virus strains were selected for those experiments, one being the most sensitive to carrageenan (H1N1(09)pdm) and one being the least sensitive (H7N7). In both cases the isobolograms show a synergistic interaction of carrageenan and Zanamivir (Fig 1) . Thus, it was shown that Zanamivir and carrageenan target individual influenza viruses with different efficiencies, most probably due to their different antiviral strategies. As a result, the combination provides synergistic activity with higher protection against a broader spectrum of influenza virus strains than the individual compounds. In the influenza animal model, C57Bl/6 mice are challenged with a lethal dose of the respective virus and treated with different regimens in comparison to a vehicle control (placebo). Infection and treatment (twice a day for 5 days) are done intranasally without anesthesia.Question: What is the recovery benefit of carageenan in patients with any respiratory virus?","answer":"1.9 day faster recovery from common cold symptoms than placebo treated patients in the intention-to-treat population"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

In this work we give a new combinatorial formulation to the data splitting problem. We see the data splitting problem as a purely combinatorial problem, in which we have to split data attributes into different fragments in a way that satisfies certain combinatorial properties derived from processing and privacy constraints. Using this formulation, we develop new combinatorial and algebraic techniques to obtain solutions to the data splitting problem. We present an algebraic method which builds an optimal data splitting solution by using Gr \\" o bner bases. Since this method is not efficient in general, we also develop a greedy algorithm for finding solutions that are not necessarily minimal sized.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: We introduce the notion of covering complexity of a verifier for probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs). Such a verifier is given an input, a claimed theorem, and an oracle, representing a purported proof of the theorem. The verifier is also given a random string and decides whether to accept the proof or not, based on the given random string. We define the covering complexity of such a verifier, on a given input, to be the minimum number of proofs needed to \\"satisfy\\" the verifier on every random string; i.e., on every random string, at least one of the given proofs must be accepted by the verifier. The covering complexity of PCP verifiers offers a promising route to getting stronger inapproximability results for some minimization problems and, in particular, (hyper)graph coloring problems. We present a PCP verifier for NP statements that queries only four bits and yet has a covering complexity of one for true statements and a superconstant covering complexity for statements not in the language. Moreover, the acceptance predicate of this verifier is a simple not-all-equal check on the four bits it reads. This enables us to prove that, for any constant c, it is NP-hard to color a 2-colorable 4-uniform hypergraph using just c colors and also yields a superconstant inapproximability result under a stronger hardness assumption.[2]: Recent trends towards database outsourcing, as well as concerns and laws governing data privacy, have led to great interest in enabling secure database services. Previous approaches to enabling such a service have been based on data encryption, causing a large overhead in query processing. We propose a new, distributed architecture that allows an organization to outsource its data management to two untrusted servers while preserving data privacy. We show how the presence of two servers enables efficient partitioning of data so that the contents at any one server are guaranteed not to breach data privacy. We show how to optimize and execute queries in this architecture, and discuss new challenges that emerge in designing the database schema.","answer":"The optimal decomposition problem described in [2] is hard to solve even if vertex deletion is not allowed. In fact, [1] proved that it is NP-hard to color a 2-colorable, 4-uniform hypergraph using only @math colors for any constant @math . This means that, in the case that all 4-tuples of attributes are sensitive, it is NP-hard to find a partition of attributes into two sets that satisfies all privacy constraints, even knowing that it exists.

A new human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was quickly identified, and the associated disease is now referred to as coronavirus disease discovered in 2019 (COVID-19) (https://globalbiodefense. com/novel-coronavirus-covid-19-portal/). According to what has been reported [1] [2] [3] , COVID-2019 seems to have similar clinical manifestations to that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV. The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence also has ∼80% identity with SARS-CoV, but it is most similar to some bat beta-coronaviruses, with the highest being >96% identity [4, 5] . Currently, there are speculations, rumours and conspiracy theories that SARS-CoV-2 is of laboratory origin. Some people have alleged that the human SARS-CoV-2 was leaked directly from a laboratory in Wuhan where a bat CoV (RaTG13) was recently reported, which shared ∼96% homology with the SARS-CoV-2 [4] . However, as we know, the human SARS-CoV and intermediate host palm civet SARSlike CoV shared 99.8% homology, with a total of 202 single-nucleotide (nt) variations (SNVs) identified across the genome [6] . Given that there are greater than 1,100 nt differences between the human SARS-CoV-2 and the bat RaTG13-CoV [4] , which are distributed throughout the genome in a naturally occurring pattern following the evolutionary characteristics typical of CoVs, it is highly unlikely that RaTG13 CoV is the immediate source of SARS-CoV-2. The absence of a logical targeted pattern in the new viral sequences and a close relative in a wildlife species (bats) are the most revealing signs that SARS-CoV-2 evolved by natural evolution. A search for an intermediate animal host between bats and humans is needed to identify animal CoVs more closely related to human SARS-CoV-2. There is speculation that pangolins might carry CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2, but the data to substantiate this is not yet published (https:// www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00364-2). Another claim in Chinese social media points to a Nature Medicine paper published in 2015 [7] , which reports the construction of a chimeric CoV with a bat CoV S gene (SHC014) in the backbone of a SARS CoV that has adapted to infect mice (MA15) and is capable of infecting human cells [8] . However, this claim lacks any scientific basis and must be discounted because of significant divergence in the genetic sequence of this construct with the new SARS-CoV-2 (>5,000 nucleotides). The mouse-adapted SARS virus (MA15) [9] was generated by serial passage of an infectious wildtype SARS CoV clone in the respiratory tract of BALB/c mice. After 15 passages in mice, the SARS-CoV gained elevated replication and lung pathogenesis in aged mice (hence M15), due to six coding genetic mutations associated with mouse adaptation. It is likely that MA15 is highly attenuated to replicate in human cells or patients due to the mouse adaptation. It was proposed that the S gene from bat-derived CoV, unlike that from human patients-or civetsderived viruses, was unable to use human ACE2 as a receptor for entry into human cells [10, 11] . Civets were proposed to be an intermediate host of the bat-CoVs, capable of spreading SARS CoV to humans [6, 12] . However, in 2013 several novel bat coronaviruses were isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats and the bat SARS-like or SL-CoV-WIV1 was able to use ACE2 from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats for entry [8] . Combined with evolutionary evidence that the bat ACE2 gene has been positively selected at the same contact sites as the human ACE2 gene for interacting with SARS CoV [13] , it was proposed that an intermediate host may not be necessary and that some bat SL-CoVs may be able to directly infect human hosts. To directly address this possibility, the exact S gene from bat coronavirus SL-SHC014 was synthesized and used to generate a chimeric virus in the mouse adapted MA15 SARS-CoV backbone. The resultant SL-SHC014-MA15 virus could indeed efficiently use human ACE2 and replicate in primary human airway cells to similar titres as epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. While SL-SHC014-MA15 can replicate efficiently in young and aged mouse lungs, infection was attenuated, and less virus antigen was present in the airway epithelium as compared to SARS MA15, which causes lethal outcomes in aged mice [7] . Due to the elevated pathogenic activity of the SHC014-MA15 chimeric virus relative to MA15 chimeric virus with the original human SARS S gene in mice, such experiments with SL-SHC014-MA15 chimeric virus were later restricted as gain of function (GOF) studies under the US government-mandated pause policy (https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-weare/nih-director/statements/nih-lifts-funding-pausegain-function-research). The current COVID-2019 epidemic has restarted the debate over the risks of constructing such viruses that could have pandemic potential, irrespective of the finding that these bat CoVs already exist in nature. Regardless, upon careful phylogenetic analyses by multiple international groups [5, 14] , the SARS-CoV-2 is undoubtedly distinct from SL-SHC014-MA15, with >6,000 nucleotide differences across the whole genome. Therefore, once again there is no credible evidence to support the claim that the SARS-CoV-2 is derived from the chimeric SL-SHC014-MA15 virus. There are also rumours that the SARS-CoV-2 was artificially, or intentionally, made by humans in the lab, and this is highlighted in one manuscript submitted to BioRxiv (a manuscript sharing site prior to any peer review), claiming that SARS-CoV-2 has HIV sequence in it and was thus likely generated in the laboratory. In a rebuttal paper led by an HIV-1 virologist Dr. Feng Gao, they used careful bioinformatics analyses to demonstrate that the original claim of multiple HIV insertions into the SARS-CoV-2 is not HIV-1 specific but random [15] . Because of the many concerns raised by the international community, the authors who made the initial claim have already withdrawn this report. Evolution is stepwise and accrues mutations gradually over time, whereas synthetic constructs would typically use a known backbone and introduce logical or targeted changes instead of the randomly occurring mutations that are present in naturally isolated viruses such as bat CoV RaTG13. In our view, there is currently no credible evidence to support the claim that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a laboratory-engineered CoV. It is more likely that SARS-CoV-2 is a recombinant CoV generated in nature between a bat CoV and another coronavirus in an intermediate animal host. More studies are needed to explore this possibility and resolve the natural origin of SARS-CoV-2. We should emphasize that, although SARS-CoV-2 shows no evidence of laboratory origin, viruses with such great public health threats must be handled properly in the laboratory and also properly regulated by the scientific community and governments.

From the stems of Croton cascarilloides, eight new diterpenoids, named crotocascarins A-H (1-8), having a crotofolane skeleton were isolated along with two new nor-diterpenoids (9 and 10), named crotocascarins α and β, derived through rearrangement of the crotofolane skeleton. The structures of these compounds were elucidated by means of extensive one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopic analyses. The absolute structures of the diterpene moiety were determined by application of the circular dichroism (CD) rule for the γ-lactone ring. The relative structures of the two crotofolanes (1 and 2) and one rearranged compound (9) were confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analyses. Compounds 1, 2 and 9 possessed 2-methylbutyric acid in their molecules, the absolute configuration of which was found to be 2S by comparison of its HPLC behavior with that of an authentic sample. Therefore, the absolute structures of these crotocascarins (1, 2 and 9) were unambiguously determined. The absolute structures of crotofolanes are reported for the first time in this paper.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"crotocascarins A-H\\", \\"crotofolane\\", \\"Nor-Diterpenoids\\", \\"crotocascarins\\", \\"diterpene\\", \\"2-methylbutyric acid\\", \\"diterpenoids\\", \\"u03b3-lactone\\", \\"nor-diterpenoids\\", \\"crotofolanes\\", \\"Diterpenoids\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown sections from a scientific research paper, together with a question about the paper.

Unfortunately, it has been proved to be worse than conventional alignment models in aligment accuracy. In this paper, we analyze and explain this issue from the point view of re- ordering, and propose a supervised attention which is learned with guidance from conventional alignment models. Experiments on two Chinese-to-English translation tasks show that the super- vised attention mechanism yields better alignments leading to substantial gains over the standard attention based NMT.IntroductionNeural Machine Translation (NMT) has achieved great successes on machine translation tasks recently BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 . Generally, it relies on a recurrent neural network under the Encode-Decode framework: it firstly encodes a source sentence into context vectors and then generates its translation token-by-token, selecting from the target vocabulary. Among different variants of NMT, attention based NMT, which is the focus of this paper, is attracting increasing interests in the community BIBREF0 , BIBREF2 . One of its advantages is that it is able to dynamically make use of the encoded context through an attention mechanism thereby allowing the use of fewer hidden layers while still maintaining high levels of translation performance.An attention mechanism is designed to predict the alignment of a target word with respect to source words. In order to facilitate incremental decoding, it tries to make this alignment prediction without any information about the target word itself, and thus this attention can be considered to be a form of a reordering model (see § SECREF2 for more details). However, it differs from conventional alignment models that are able to use the target word to infer its alignments BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , and as a result there is a substantial gap in quality between the alignments derived by this attention based NMT and conventional alignment models (54 VS 30 in terms of AER for Chinese-to-English as reported in BIBREF6 ). This discrepancy might be an indication that the potential of NMT is limited. In addition, the attention in NMT is learned in an unsupervised manner without explicit prior knowledge about alignment. In contrast, in conventional statistical machine translation (SMT), it is standard practice to learn reordering models in a supervised manner with the guidance from conventional alignment models.Inspired by the supervised reordering in conventional SMT, in this paper, we propose a Supervised Attention based NMT (SA-NMT) model. Specifically, similar to conventional SMT, we first run off-the-shelf aligners (GIZA++ BIBREF3 or fast_align BIBREF4 etc.) to obtain the alignment of the bilingual training corpus in advance. Then, treating this alignment result as the supervision of attention, we jointly learn attention and translation, both in supervised manners. Since the conventional aligners delivers higher quality alignment, it is expected that the alignment in the supervised attention NMT will be improved leading to better end-to-end translation performance. One advantage of the proposed SA-NMT is that it implements the supervision of attention as a regularization in the joint training objective (§3.2). Furthermore, since the supervision of attention lies in the middle of the entire network architecture rather than the top ( as in the supervision of translation (see Figure 1(b)), it serves to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem during the back-propagation BIBREF7 .This paper makes the following contributions:Revisiting Neural Machine TranslationSuppose INLINEFORM0 denotes a source sentence, INLINEFORM1 a target sentence. In addition, let INLINEFORM2 denote a prefix of INLINEFORM3 . Neural Machine Translation (NMT) directly maps a source sentence into a target under an encode-decode framework. In the encoding stage, it uses two bidirectional recurrent neural networks to encode INLINEFORM4 into a sequence of vectors INLINEFORM5 , with INLINEFORM6 representing the concatenation of two vectors for INLINEFORM7 source word from two directional RNNs. In the decoding stage, it generates the target translation from the conditional probability over the pair of sequences INLINEFORM8 and INLINEFORM9 via a recurrent neural network parametrized by INLINEFORM10 as follows: DISPLAYFORM0 where INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 respectively denote an RNN hidden state (i.e. a vector) and a context vector at timestep INLINEFORM2 ; INLINEFORM3 is a transformation function mapping into a vector with dimension of the target vocabulary size; and INLINEFORM4 denotes the INLINEFORM5 component of a vector. Furthermore, INLINEFORM7 is defined by an activation function, i.e. a Gated Recurrent Unit BIBREF8 ; and the context vector INLINEFORM8 is a dynamical source representation at timestep INLINEFORM9 , and calculated as the weighted sum of source encodings INLINEFORM10 , i.e. INLINEFORM11 . Here the weight INLINEFORM12 implements an attention mechanism, and INLINEFORM13 is the alignment probability of INLINEFORM14 being aligned to INLINEFORM15 . INLINEFORM16 is derived through a feedforward neural network INLINEFORM17 as follows: DISPLAYFORM0 where INLINEFORM0 consists of two layers, the top one being a softmax layer. We skip the detailed definitions of INLINEFORM1 together with INLINEFORM2 , INLINEFORM3 and INLINEFORM4 , and refer the readers to BIBREF0 instead. Figure 1(a) shows one slice of computational graph for NMT definition at time step INLINEFORM9 .To train NMT, the following negative log-likelyhood is minimized: DISPLAYFORM0 where INLINEFORM0 is a bilingual sentence pair from a given training corpus, INLINEFORM1 is as defined in Eq.( EQREF5 ). Note that even though the training is conducted in a supervised manner with respect to translation, i.e., INLINEFORM2 are observable in Figure 1(a), the attention is learned in a unsupervised manner, since INLINEFORM3 is hidden.In Figure 1(a), INLINEFORM0 can not be dependent on INLINEFORM1 , as the target word INLINEFORM2 is unknown at the timestep INLINEFORM3 during the testing. Therefore, at timestep INLINEFORM4 , NMT firstly tries to calculate INLINEFORM5 , through which NMT figures out those source words will be translated next, even though the next target word INLINEFORM6 is unavailable. From this point of view, the attention mechanism plays a role in reordering and thus can be considered as a reordering model. Unlike this attention model, conventional alignment models define the alignment INLINEFORM7 directly over INLINEFORM8 and INLINEFORM9 as follows: INLINEFORM10 where INLINEFORM0 denotes either a log-probability INLINEFORM1 for a generative model like IBM models BIBREF9 or a feature function for discriminative models BIBREF5 . In order to infer INLINEFORM2 , alignment models can readily use the entire INLINEFORM3 , of course including INLINEFORM4 as well, thereby they can model the alignment between INLINEFORM5 and INLINEFORM6 more sufficiently. As a result, the attention based NMT might not deliver satisfying alignments, as reported in BIBREF6 , compared to conventional alignment models. This may be a sign that the potential of NMT is limited in end-to-end translation.Supervised AttentionIn this section, we introduce supervised attention to improve the alignment, which consequently leads to better translation performance for NMT. Our basic idea is simple: similar to conventional SMT, it firstly uses a conventional aligner to obtain the alignment on the training corpus; then it employs these alignment results as supervision to train the NMT. During testing, decoding proceeds in exactly the same manner as standard NMT, since there is no alignment supervision available for unseen test sentences.Jointly Supervising Translation and AttentionWe propose a soft constraint method to jointly supervise the translation and attention as follows: DISPLAYFORM0 where INLINEFORM0 is as defined in Eq. ( EQREF5 ), INLINEFORM1 is a loss function that penalizes the disagreement between INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 , and INLINEFORM4 is a hyper-parameter that balances the preference between likelihood and disagreement. In this way, we treat the attention variable INLINEFORM5 as an observable variable as shown in Figure 1(b), and this is different from the standard NMT as shown in Figure 1(a) in essence. Note that this training objective resembles to that in multi-task learning BIBREF11 . Our supervised attention method has two further advantages: firstly, it is able to alleviate overfitting by means of the INLINEFORM6 ; and secondly it is capable of addressing the vanishing gradient problem because the supervision of INLINEFORM7 is more close to INLINEFORM8 than INLINEFORM9 as in Figure 1(b).In order to quantify the disagreement between INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 , three different methods are investigated in our experiments:Mean Squared Error (MSE) INLINEFORM0 MSE is widely used as a loss for regression tasks BIBREF12 , and it directly encourages INLINEFORM0 to be equal to INLINEFORM1 .Multiplication (MUL) INLINEFORM0 MUL is particularly designed for agreement in word alignment and it has been shown to be effective BIBREF13 , BIBREF6 . Note that different from those in BIBREF6 , INLINEFORM0 is not a parametrized variable but a constant in this paper.Cross Entropy (CE) INLINEFORM0 Since for each INLINEFORM0 , INLINEFORM1 is a distribution, it is natural to use CE as the metric to evaluate the disagreement BIBREF14 .Results on the Low Resource Translation TaskFor the low resource translation task, we used the BTEC corpus as the training data, which consists of 30k sentence pairs with 0.27M Chinese words and 0.33M English words. As development and test sets, we used the CSTAR03 and IWSLT04 held out sets, respectively. We trained a 4-gram language model on the target side of training corpus for running Moses. For training all NMT systems, we employed the same settings as those in the large scale task, except that vocabulary size is 6000, batch size is 16, and the hyper-parameter INLINEFORM0 for SA-NMT.Table TABREF32 reports the final results. Firstly, we can see that both standard neural machine translation systems NMT1 and NMT2 are much worse than Moses with a substantial gap. This result is not difficult to understand: neural network systems typically require sufficient data to boost their performance, and thus low resource translation tasks are very challenging for them. Secondly, the proposed SA-NMT gains much over NMT2 similar to the case in the large scale task, and the gap towards Moses is narrowed substantially.While our SA-NMT does not advance the state-of-the-art Moses as in large scale translation, this is a strong result if we consider that previous works on low resource translation tasks: arthur+:2016 gained over Moses on the Japanese-to-English BTEC corpus, but they resorted to a corpus consisting of 464k sentence pairs; luong+manning:2015 revealed the comparable performance to Moses on English-to-Vietnamese with 133k sentences pairs, which is more than 4 times of our corprus size. Our method is possible to advance Moses by using reranking as in BIBREF20 , BIBREF21 , but it is beyond the scope of this paper and instead we remain it as future work.Related WorkMany recent works have led to notable improvements in the attention mechanism for neural machine translation. tu+:2016 introduced an explicit coverage vector into the attention mechanism to address the over-translation and under-translation inherent in NMT. feng+:2016 proposed an additional recurrent structure for attention to capture long-term dependencies. cheng+:2016 proposed an agreement-based bidirectional NMT model for symmetrizing alignment. cohn+:2016 incorporated multiple structural alignment biases into attention learning for better alignment. All of them improved the attention models that were learned in an unsupervised manner. While we do not modify the attention model itself, we learn it in a supervised manner, therefore our approach is orthogonal to theirs.It has always been standard practice to learn reordering models from alignments for conventional SMT either at the phrase level or word level. At the phrase level, koehn+:2007 proposed a lexicalized MSD model for phrasal reordering; xiong+:2006 proposed a feature-rich model to learn phrase reordering for BTG; and li+:2014 proposed a neural network method to learn a BTG reordering model. At the word level, bisazza+federico:2016 surveyed many word reordering models learned from alignment models for SMT, and in particular there are some neural network based reordering models, such as BIBREF22 . Our work is inspired by these works in spirit, and it can be considered to be a recurrent neural network based word-level reordering model. The main difference is that in our approach the reordering model and translation model are trained jointly rather than separately as theirs.ConclusionIt has been shown that attention mechanism in NMT is worse than conventional word alignment models in its alignment accuracy. This paper firstly provides an explanation for this by viewing the atten- tion mechanism from the point view of reordering. Then it proposes a supervised attention for NMT with guidance from external conventional alignment models, inspired by the supervised reordering models in conventional SMT. Experiments on two Chinese-to-English translation tasks show that the proposed approach achieves better alignment results leading to significant gains relative to standard attention based NMT.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank Xugang Lu for invaluable discussions on this work.Figure 2: Learning curves of NMT2 and SA-NMT on the development set.Table 4: Results on word alignment task for the large scale data.

We report the prospect i ve discovery of ErbB2 mutations that confer resistance to the small-molecule inhibitor lapatinib . Experimental Design : We did in vitro screening using a r and omly mutagenized ErbB2 expression library in Ba/F3 cells , which were dependent on ErbB2 activity for survival and growth . Results : Lapatinib resistance screens identified mutations at 16 different ErbB2 amino acid residues , with 12 mutated amino acids mapping to the kinase domain . Mutations conferring the greatest lapatinib resistance cluster in the NH2-terminal kinase lobe and hinge region . Structural computer modeling studies suggest that lapatinib resistance is caused by multiple mechanisms ; including direct steric interference and restriction of conformational flexibility ( the inactive state required for lapatinib binding is energetically unfavorable ) . ErbB2 T798I imparts the strongest lapatinib resistance effect and is analogous to the epidermal growth factor receptor T790 M , ABL T315I , and cKIT T670I gatekeeper mutations that are associated with clinical drug resistance . ErbB2 mutants associated with lapatinib resistance transformed NIH-3T3 cells , including L755S and T733I mutations known to occur in human breast and gastric carcinomas , supporting a direct mechanism for lapatinib resistance in ErbB2-driven human cancers . The epidermal growth factor receptor/ErbB2/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor EXEL-7647 was found to inhibit almost all lapatinib resistance-associated mutations . Furthermore , no ErbB2 mutations were found to be associated with EXEL-7647 resistance and lapatinib sensitivity . Conclusions : Taken together , these data suggest potential target-based mechanisms of resistance to lapatinib and suggest that EXEL-7647 may be able to circumvent these effectsTitle 2:Trastuzumab after adjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-positive breast cancer.Abstract 2:BACKGROUND Trastuzumab , a recombinant monoclonal antibody against HER2 , has clinical activity in advanced breast cancer that overexpresses HER2 . We investigated its efficacy and safety after excision of early-stage breast cancer and completion of chemotherapy . METHODS This international , multicenter , r and omized trial compared one or two years of trastuzumab given every three weeks with observation in patients with HER2-positive and either node-negative or node-positive breast cancer who had completed locoregional therapy and at least four cycles of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy .  RESULTS Data were available for 1694 women r and omly assigned to two years of treatment with trastuzumab , 1694 women assigned to one year of trastuzumab , and 1693 women assigned to observation .  We report here the results only of treatment with trastuzumab for one year or observation . At the first planned interim analysis ( median follow-up of one year ) , 347 events ( recurrence of breast cancer , contralateral breast cancer , second nonbreast malignant disease , or death ) were observed : 127 events in the trastuzumab group and 220 in the observation group . The unadjusted hazard ratio for an event in the trastuzumab group , as compared with the observation group , was 0.54 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0.43 to 0.67 ; P<0.0001 by the log-rank test , crossing the interim analysis boundary ) , representing an absolute benefit in terms of disease-free survival at two years of 8.4 percentage points . Overall survival in the two groups was not significantly different ( 29 deaths with trastuzumab vs. 37 with observation ) . Severe cardiotoxicity developed in 0.5 percent of the women who were treated with trastuzumab .

However, the clinical difficulty in using this approach lies in determining which type II SCHFs can be managed successfully without a surgical intervention.(METHODS) We reviewed clinical and radiographic information on 259 pediatric type II SCHFs that were enrolled in a prospective registry of elbow fractures. The characteristics of the patients who were treated without surgery were compared with those of patients who were treated surgically. Treatment outcomes, as assessed by the final clinical and radiographic alignment, range of motion of the elbow, and complications, were compared between the groups to define clinical and radiographic features that related to success or failure of nonoperative management.(RESULTS) During the course of treatment, 39 fractures were found to have unsatisfactory alignment with nonoperative management and were taken for surgery. Ultimately, 150 fractures (57.9%) were treated nonoperatively, and 109 fractures (42.1%) were treated surgically. At final follow-up, outcome measures of change in carrying angle, range of motion, and complications did not show clinically significant differences between treatment groups. Fractures without rotational deformity or coronal angulation and with a shaft-condylar angle of>15 degrees were more likely to be associated with successful nonsurgical treatment. A scoring system was developed using these features to stratify the severity of the injury. Patients with isolated extension deformity, but none of the other features, were more likely to complete successful nonoperative management.Question:Type II supracondylar humerus fractures: can some be treated nonoperatively?Answer:","answer":"YES"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

However, the relationship between the perceived value of a reward, the latent value of a reward, and the behavioral response remains unclear. Here we report that, given a choice between two sweet and chemically similar sugars—L- and D-arabinose—Drosophila melanogaster prefers D- over L- arabinose, but forms long-term memories of L-arabinose more reliably. Behavioral assays indicate that L-arabinose-generated memories require sugar receptor Gr43a, and calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings indicate that L- and D-arabinose differentially activate Gr43a-expressing neurons. We posit that the immediate valence of a reward is not always predictive of the long-term reinforcement value of that reward, and that a subset of sugar-sensing neurons may generate distinct representations of similar sugars, allowing for rapid assessment of the salient features of various sugar rewards and generation of reward-specific behaviors. However, how sensory neurons communicate information about L-arabinose quality and concentration—features relevant for long-term memory—remains unknown.Introduction:In an environment filled with various stimuli, the positive experiences an animal remembers are widely assumed to be rewarding and salient. Long-term associative memories in particular are supposed to reflect the intensity of past responses to rewards. The experiences we remember, however, are not always those we expect to remember. How immediate reward perceptions influence future actions is therefore of wide interest. Among various positive rewards, food, and in particular sweet food, has been most revealing since it is a source of both pleasure( immediate value) and nutrition( long-term value). Food is also a complex reward. Having evolved in distinct ecological niches, different species of Drosophila display distinct food preferences and discriminate between potential sources of nutrition( Dethier, 1976). For example, while some species of Drosophila prefer rotting fruits, others prefer mushrooms, cacti, or hibiscus flowers( Markow and O'Grady, 2005). Identifying and remembering relevant food, therefore, is essential for survival. Moreover, food is often not a single substance but a mixture of various compounds, and not all are equally rewarding: rotting fruits contain various sugars, alcohols, and acids that produce varying responses( Yarmolinsky et al., 2009; Charlu et al., 2013). Food in natural contexts is also always part of an environment filled with other features, including predators, and therefore quick evaluation of potential food sources requires simultaneous processing of multiple stimuli. Finally, the attraction to food, and memories of it, are influenced by the internal state of the organism, such as whether the animal is hungry or satiated( Colomb et al., 2009; Krashes et al., 2009; Toshima and Tanimura, 2012; Dethier, 1976). It is therefore likely that contingent on their internal state, animals use certain components of food sources to quickly recognize those that are appropriate for feeding and, if worthwhile, to form memories of these sources for future visits. How these different aspects of food very quickly generate appropriate memories that guide future food-seeking behavior, however, remains unclear. One possibility is that whatever components of food are most salient for long-term behavior are the same features that animals find immediately rewarding. This would predict that the more appealing( or palatable) a sugar is, the better it will be remembered. Another possibility is that certain components of food can reinforce memory relatively independent of the food’s immediate appeal, because they indicate specific attributes of the food( e. g. nutritional content) that are of long-term relevance. In a complex environment, where an animal needs to process multiple stimuli simultaneously, such processing may ensure that regardless of the immediate response, stimuli of long-term relevance will be remembered. In the course of exploring both the immediate appeal of various natural sugars and their ability to generate long-term associative memories, we serendipitously discovered that these two processes are separable. A specific illustration of this phenomenon is seen with the two chemically similar sugars, D- and L-arabinose: flies greatly prefer D-arabinose to L-arabinose, but better remember an odor paired with L-arabinose than with D-arabinose. We have also begun to explore how an animal assesses whether an experience that is rewarding in the moment is also of long-term relevance. Many studies have characterized higher order systems, particularly the neuromodulatory systems such as dopaminergic( Schwaerzel et al., 2003; Huetteroth et al., 2015; Berry et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012; Yamagata et al., 2015; Musso et al., 2015), octopaminergic( Burke et al., 2012; Schwaerzel et al., 2003), neuropeptide F( Krashes et al., 2009) and mushroom body neurons( Aso et al., 2014; Kirkhart and Scott, 2015; Vogt et al., 2014) underlying long-term sugar reward memory in Drosophila. How various sugars differentially engage the higher order reward system, however, remains unclear. We find that D- and L-arabinose differentially activate the same peripheral Gr43a-expressing neurons, and that activating Gr43a in some but not all manners can substitute for the sugar reward, indicating that sensory neurons can at least partially mediate this discrimination process. However, the exact mechanism by which these sensory neurons communicate the relevant features of L-arabinose to higher order systems remains unclear at this stage.Discussion:The caloric value of a sugar has been found to be an important determinant of long-term appetitive memory( Burke and Waddell, 2011; Fujita and Tanimura, 2011; Musso et al., 2015), implying that flies quickly metabolize the sugar and that caloric evaluation somehow provides cues necessary to elicit long-term memory. We find that sugar with no caloric value can also produce long-term appetitive memories. One obvious possibility is that memories of sweet nutritious sugars are distinct from memories of sweet non-nutritious sugars. However, this seems so far not to be the case: a subset of higher order dopaminergic neurons( R58E02GAL4) necessary for long-term memory of nutritious sucrose( Liu et al., 2012) is also required for non-nutritious L-arabinose( Figure 6—figure supplement 1B). Similarly, addition of sorbitol, a tasteless but nutritious sugar, enhances the memory of non-nutritious sugars like xylose and D-arabinose, but does not enhance the memory of nutritious sugars( Burke and Waddell, 2011). Adding sorbitol to L-arabinose had no additive effect on long-term memory( Figure 6—figure supplement 1C). It therefore appears that L-arabinose memory uses at least some of the same downstream neural circuitry as memory of nutritious sugars. Whether memory of L-arabinose, a non-nutritious sugar, is an exception or represents a more general phenomenon is unclear since we have tested only a limited number of sugars in a particular behavioral paradigm. However, in addition to L-arabinose, L-fucose can also produce memory( Figure 1E); both are components of the pectin in many fruits’ cell walls( Dick and Labavitch, 1989; Ahmed and Labavitch, 1980). It is therefore possible that these sugars may signal some specific attributes of ripening fruit—ripening is accompanied by breakdown of the fruit’s cell walls—although neither of these sugars are present in fruits near the concentrations( 1 M) used in memory assays. Nonetheless, these observations suggest that flies can quickly assess salient features of sugars—a sort of leading indicator of nutritional value—without the sugar’s metabolic breakdown. This approach to memory formation may allow flies to quickly recognize and remember potential foods using specific cues, a time advantage that could be vital in natural contexts. Do insects distinguish structurally similar sugars? The taste modality of insects, particularly Drosophila, is reported to have limited discriminatory power and be primarily based on the intensity of the stimuli as opposed to the chemical nature of the sugar( Masek and Scott, 2010). Indeed we find that, apart from flies’ differential preference for various sugars at equal concentrations, for immediate and short-term behavior this is largely true. However, we did not observe any obvious correlation between immediate behavior and long-term memories: flies immediate preference is L-fucose > D-arabinose > L-arabinose > L-sorbose( Figure 1D); for short-term memory, L-sorbose = D-arabinose ≥ L-arabinose = L-fucose( Figure 1E); but in order of long-term memory score, L-arabinose ≥ L-fucose ≥ D-arabinose = L-sorbose( Figure 1F). These results indicate that while short-term responses are guided by palatability, long-term behavioral reponses are guided by additional attributes of the sugars. It is not yet clear why D-arabinose is a less effective stimulus. Since D- and L-arabinose are both sweet, they may generate positive sensations in a different manner, or perhaps D-arabinose carries a negative value that over time reduces the positive association formed initially( or dampens the behavioral output). The gustatory receptors Gr5a, Gr43a, Gr61a, and Gr64a-f have been implicated in sugar detection( Fujii et al., 2015; Freeman and Dahanukar, 2015; Dahanukar et al., 2007; Scott et al., 2001; Dunipace et al., 2001; Montell, 2009; Jiao et al., 2007, 2008; Joseph and Carlson, 2015). Although exactly which Gr receptors are responsible for detecting which sugar remains somewhat controversial, two features of sweet-sensing gustatory receptors are generally agreed upon: first, different gustatory neurons express a number of Gr receptors in unique combinations; second, more than one receptor is typically involved in detecting a sugar( Fujii et al., 2015). However, the physiological consequences of this combinatorial expression of semi-redundant gustatory receptors remain uncertain. This study raises the possibility that gustatory neurons in different locations, expressing unique combinations of receptors, are responsible for discriminating chemically similar sugars and eliciting different behavioral responses. Consistent with this idea, previous studies suggested that Gr43a neurons in the central brain monitor hemolymph fructose levels and modulate feeding behavior( Miyamoto et al., 2012), while we find that these neurons are dispensable for L-arabinose memory, and that peripheral Gr43a-neurons are likely sufficient to signal the presence of a rewarding sugar and generate associative memories. These differences likely arise from the locations of these neurons, differentially expressed receptors, the presence or absence of various co-receptors, and the second-order neurons to which these neurons project. Exactly which or how many Gr43a-, Gr61a-, and Gr5a-expressing neurons in the periphery are sufficient for L-arabinose memory is currently unclear. We also find that activation of Gr43a-expressing neurons by ReaChR but not dTrpA1 is able to generate appetitive memory, while artificially activating a subset of dopaminergic neurons( R58E02GAL4) by heat( dTrpA1) or light( ReaChR) both led to long-term memory( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A). How a difference in activity at the sensory level is conveyed to higher-order neurons, and how that difference is interpreted by the higher-order neurons, remains unclear. More concretely, why is dTrpA1 activation of a subset of dopamine neurons sufficient to generate memory, but dTrpA1 activation of Gr43a-expressing neurons is not? One possibility is that the activity requirements of neuromodulatory systems are less stringent than those for sensory coding, and that temporal selectivity occurs before the signal reaches these dopamine neurons. Alternatively, recent studies have indicated that dopaminergic neurons are functionally diverse, and that distinct population of dopaminergic neurons are involved in appetitive associative memory( Cohn et al., 2015; Huetteroth et al., 2015; Krashes et al., 2009; Berry et al., 2012; Aso et al., 2014; Yamagata et al., 2015; Berry et al., 2015; Musso et al., 2015; Schwaerzel et al., 2003). These reports raise the possibility that differing sensory inputs could activate different subsets of dopaminergic neurons. How can structurally similar sugars generate differential activation? It is likely that although these sugars bind to some of the same receptors, the relative affinity of the receptors vary. In this regard, the fly sweet taste system may be similar to that of the mammalian system, where a single heteromeric receptor( T1R2 and T1R3) is responsible for detecting a large number of sweet substances, with multiple discrete ligand-binding sites in each receptor responsible for generating diverse responses( Yarmolinsky et al., 2009). We suspect that the differential engagement of multiple gustatory receptors leads similar chemicals to generate differential activation of the same neurons, and that differential activation and different ensembles of activated neurons allows higher-order neurons to decode the relevant features of sugars. We speculate that, at least in Drosophila, evaluation of a sugar’s long-term salience may be encoded in the activation pattern of subsets of gustatory neurons, which allows rapid evaluation and remembering of nutritious food in complex environments.","answer":"We often remember experiences that are rewarding in some way . However , not every rewarding experience is stored in memory , and the particular experiences we remember are not always those we would expect to remember . Why is it that some experiences generate long-term memories whereas others do not ? Fruit flies feed on a variety of different sugars present in rotting fruits . Although the flies find all of these sugars attractive , they form memories of some sugars more readily than others . This distinction is particularly striking in the case of two sugars with similar structures: D-arabinose and L-arabinose . Flies typically prefer D-arabinose over L-arabinose , but are more likely to remember an encounter with L-arabinose than D-arabinose . McGinnis et al . have used fruit flies to explore how the rewarding properties of an experience affect how likely it is to be stored in memory . The experiments show that D-arabinose and L-arabinose generate different patterns of activity in the fly brain , and identify a subset of taste neurons that support the formation of memories specifically about L-arabinose . These neurons enable flies to associate features of their environment – such as odors – with the presence of this one particular sugar . Such memories may help the flies to find a similar food source again in the future . Artificially activating these neurons is also sufficient to trigger the formation of a memory , even in the absence of L-arabinose itself . Taken as a whole , this work demonstrates that the immediate appeal of a reward can be separated from its ability to generate a long-term memory . The fact that activation of taste neurons can trigger memory formation explains how flies can quickly form long-term memories about desirable food sources . Looking ahead , further work will be required to understand the mechanisms that determine what animals like at any given moment , and what they remember over time ."},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

Ingenol 3-angelate (I3A) is one of the active ingredients in Euphorbia peplus, which has been used in traditional medicine. Here, we report the initial characterization of I3A as a protein kinase C (PKC) ligand. I3A bound to PKC-alpha in the presence of phosphatidylserine with high affinity; however, under these assay conditions, little PKC isoform selectivity was observed. PKC isoforms did show different sensitivity and selectivity for down-regulation by I3A and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in WEHI-231, HOP-92, and Colo-205 cells. In all of the three cell types, I3A inhibited cell proliferation with somewhat lower potency than did PMA. In intact CHO-K1 cells, I3A was able to translocate different green fluorescent protein-tagged PKC isoforms, visualized by confocal microscopy, with equal or higher potency than PMA. PKC-delta in particular showed a different pattern of translocation in response to I3A and PMA. I3A induced a higher level of secretion of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 compared with PMA in the WEHI-231 cells and displayed a marked biphasic dose-response curve for the induction. I3A was unable to cause the same extent of association of the C1b domain of PKC-delta with lipids, compared with PMA or the physiological regulator diacylglycerol, and was able to partially block the association induced by these agents, measured by surface plasmon resonance. The in vitro kinase activity of PKC-alpha induced by I3A was lower than that induced by PMA. The novel pattern of behavior of I3A makes it of great interest for further evaluation.","answer":"[[\\"I3A\\", \\"NOT\\", \\"PKC-delta\\"], [\\"I3A\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"PKC\\"], [\\"diacylglycerol\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"PKC-delta\\"], [\\"I3A\\", \\"INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR\\", \\"cytokine\\"], [\\"PMA\\", \\"INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR\\", \\"cytokine\\"], [\\"I3A\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"PKC-alpha\\"], [\\"I3A\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"PKC-delta\\"], [\\"I3A\\", \\"INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR\\", \\"interleukin 6\\"], [\\"phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate\\", \\"DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"PKC\\"], [\\"I3A\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"protein kinase C\\"], [\\"phosphatidylserine\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"PKC-alpha\\"], [\\"diacylglycerol\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"C1b domain\\"], [\\"PMA\\", \\"ACTIVATOR\\", \\"PKC-alpha\\"], [\\"I3A\\", \\"NOT\\", \\"C1b domain\\"], [\\"PMA\\", \\"INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR\\", \\"interleukin 6\\"], [\\"PMA\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"PKC-delta\\"], [\\"I3A\\", \\"ACTIVATOR\\", \\"PKC-alpha\\"], [\\"I3A\\", \\"DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"PKC\\"], [\\"PMA\\", \\"DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"PKC\\"], [\\"PMA\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"PKC\\"], [\\"PMA\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"C1b domain\\"]]"},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

A special case of MWBIS, when the weight assigned to each vertex is equal to its degree in @math , is called the problem. In other words, the MIVC problem is about finding an independent set of cardinality at most @math with maximum coverage. Since it is a generalization of the well-known Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem, MWBIS too does not have any constant factor polynomial time approximation algorithm assuming @math . In this paper, we study MWBIS in the context of bipartite graphs. We show that, unlike MWIS, the MIVC (and thereby the MWBIS) problem in bipartite graphs is NP-hard. Then, we show that the MWBIS problem admits a @math -factor approximation algorithm in the class of bipartite graphs, which matches the integrality gap of a natural LP relaxation.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Graphs are often used to model risk management in various systems. Particularly, in [6] have considered a system which essentially represents a tripartite graph. The goal in this model is to reduce the risk in the system below a predefined risk threshold level. It can be shown that the main goal in this risk management system can be formulated as a Partial Vertex Cover problem on bipartite graphs. It is well-known that the vertex cover problem is in P on bipartite graphs; however, the computational complexity of the partial vertex cover problem on bipartite graphs is open. In this paper, we show that the partial vertex cover problem is NP-hard on bipartite graphs. Then, we show that the budgeted maximum coverage problem (a problem related to partial vertex cover problem) admits an ( 8 9 )-approximation algorithm in the class of bipartite graphs, which matches the integrality gap of a natural LP relaxation.[2]: In this paper we demonstrate a general method of designing constant-factor approximation algorithms for some discrete optimization problems with cardinality constraints. The core of the method is a simple deterministic (\\"pipage\\") procedure of rounding of linear relaxations. By using the method we design a (1-(1-1 k)k)-approximation algorithm for the maximum coverage problem where k is the maximum size of the subsets that are covered, and a 1 2-approximation algorithm for the maximum cut problem with given sizes of parts in the vertex set bipartition. The performance guarantee of the former improves on that of the well-known (1 - e-1)-greedy algorithm due to Cornuejols, Fisher and Nemhauser in each case of bounded k. The latter is, to the best of our knowledge, the first constant-factor algorithm for that version of the maximum cut problem.[3]: Given a simple undirected graph G and a positive integer s the Maximum Vertex Coverage Problem is the problem of finding a set U of s vertices of G such that the number of edges having at least one endpoint in U is as large as possible. We prove that the Maximum Vertex Coverage problem on bipartite graphs is NP-hard and discuss several consequences related to known combinatorial optimization problems.[4]: Abstract We consider the max-vertex-cover (MVC) problem, i.e., find k vertices from an undirected and edge-weighted graph G =( V , E ), where | V |= n ⩾ k , such that the total edge weight covered by the k vertices is maximized. There is a 3 4-approximation algorithm for MVC, based on a linear programming relaxation. We show that the guaranteed ratio can be improved by a simple greedy algorithm for k >(3 4) n , and a simple randomized algorithm for k >(1 2) n . Furthermore, we study a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation based approximation algorithms for MVC. We show that, for a range of k , our SDP-based algorithm achieves the best performance guarantee among the four types of algorithms mentioned in this paper.[5]: Given a simple undirected graph @math and a positive integer @math , the maximum vertex coverage problem (MVC) is the problem of finding a set @math of @math vertices of @math such that the number of edges having at least one endpoint in @math is as large as possible.

By exploiting the structure of the fractional optimal solutions of a linear programming formulation for the maximum coverage problem, we provide a @math -approximation algorithm for the problem. The algorithm immediately extends to the weighted version of MVC.","answer":"Another popular variant of the VC problem is the (MVC) problem. Given a graph @math and a positive integer @math , the is about finding @math vertices that maximize the number of distinct edges covered by them in @math . Ageev and Sviridenko in [2] gave a @math -approximation algorithm for the MVC problem. An approximation algorithm, that uses a semidefinite programming technique, based on a parameter whose factor of approximation is better than @math when the parameter is sufficiently large was shown in [4] . Apollonio and Simeone in [3] proved that the MVC problem on bipartite graphs is NP-hard.

site while the majority of other commonly used sulfonylureas bind to the ab - site of the katp channel .recently , it was observed in a study on cell lines that katp channel is more sensitive to inhibition by gliclazide , but not glimepiride , glibenclamide , or glipizide ( all ab - site binding drugs ) in the carriers of k23/a1369 risk haplotype in comparison with the carriers of e23/s1369 haplotype .  we hypothesized that a difference might exist also in tcf7l2 genotype effect on glucose reduction between gliclazide and the ab -

site binding sulfonylureas ( group 2 ) are shown in table 1 .no significant difference was observed in gender representation , average age , bmi , diabetes duration , baseline hba1c , hba1c after 6 months , and sulfonylurea dose between the two groups .there was no significant difference between both groups in the average hba1c following 6-month therapy with sulfonylurea ( table 1 ) .  a total of 51 patients were homozygous for wild type c - allele ( cc genotype ) , 41 patients were heterozygous ( ct genotype ) , and 9 patients were homozygous for the type 2 diabetes associated t - allele ( tt genotype ) of tcf7l2 rs7903146 .clinical characteristics of the study group according to the tcf7l2 genotypes are displayed in table 2 .after 6 months of the sulfonylurea therapy , a significant difference among the genotypes in relation to hba1c was observed in both the entire study group and the gliclazide treated subgroup ( group 1 ) , while no significant difference in effect among the genotypes was observed in group 2 ( table 3 ) .the biggest reduction in hba1c was observed in cc genotype group , while the reductions were similar in both ct and tt genotype groups suggesting possible dominant way of inheritance ( table 3 ) .further analyses using dominant genetic model showed significantly higher effect of gliclazide in the cc genotype group on hba1c reduction in comparison with combined ct + tt genotype group ( 1.32  0.15% versus 0.73  0.11% , p = 0.003 , p = 0.005 ) .in contrast , no significant difference in hba1c between the patients with cc genotype and t - allele carriers was observed in group 2 ( table 3 ) .   in the multiple linear regression model with hba1c as dependent variable , tcf7l2 genotype , age , gender , bmi , baseline hba1c , sulfonylurea group , and sulfonylurea dose were included as independent variables ( table 4 ) . in this model the tcf7l2 genotype ( p = 0.006 ) and the baseline hba1c ( p < 0.001 ) were the only significant predictors of hba1c ( r = 0.56 ) . after introducing the interaction term between tcf7l2 genotype and sulfonylurea treatment group to the model , the variance explained by the model increased ( r = 0.58 ) and the interaction term became a significant predictor ( p = 0.023 ) of hba1c ( table 4 ) .the main finding of the present study is a significant interaction found between tcf7l2 genotype and the type of sulfonylurea used in the treatment of the patients with type 2 diabetes .the patients treated with gliclazide had significantly stronger genotype specific effect with the average reduction in hba1c in homozygous carriers of common c - allele higher by 80% than in - risk t - allele carriers .no significant genotype effect was observed in the group of patients treated by glibenclamide , glimepiride , or glipizide .   to the best of our knowledge, only three studies analyzed the effect of sulfonylurea treatment in relation to tcf7l2 genotype .pearson et al . found higher probability of sulfonylurea failure and smaller reduction in hba1c in tcf7l2 rs1225372 and rs7903146 risk allele carriers in a group of 901 patients included in the genetics of diabetes audit and research tayside study ( godarts ) .the results observed in godarts were replicated independently by two central european groups [ 12 , 13 ] . in none of the mentioned studies ,the present study extends the current knowledge by demonstrating the first observation of the different tcf7l2 genotype effect of various sulfonylureas with the strongest genetic specificity observed in gliclazide users in contrast to the patients treated with other sulfonylurea drugs , as proved by the test of interaction .  the explanation of this difference might lie in the different pharmacodynamic characteristics of gliclazide and the other studied sulfonylureas . beside the mentioned katp channelsome studies relate the tcf7l2 effect to the action of incretin hormones  glucagon - like peptide 1 ( glp-1 ) and glucose - dependent insulinotropic peptide ( gip ) .these hormones stimulate  cells primarily by the activation of the camp - dependent pathway .interestingly , it was recently shown that beside their effect on closure of katp channel , the majority of sulfonylureas also activate the exchange protein activated by camp 2 ( epac2 ) which subsequently activates small g - protein rap1 .epac2/rap1 signaling is essential for potentiating the first phase of insulin release . while in studies in animals and cell lines tolbutamide , glibenclamide , chlorpropamide , and glipizide were able to activate epac2/rap1 signaling , gliclazide did not activate this pathway [ 14 , 20 ] .because the t - allele at tcf7l2 rs7903146 has been shown to be related to incretin resistance , drugs that activate epac2 such as glimepiride or glibenclamide may attenuate the deficit incurred by tcf7l2 genotype , whereas a drug like gliclazide might be unable to do so ( figure 1 ) . whether the mentioned differences in the mechanism of action explainit is possible that unknown pathogenetic mechanisms may be involved , and further functional studies are required .  , it had limited statistical power to detect small genotype - related differences . because of its exploratory character ,in the diabetic patients treated by gliclazide , we observed bigger reduction in hba1c by 0.6% in approximately 50% of patients with the common cc genotype , in comparison with the risk tcf7l2 rs7903146 t - allele carriers .the magnitude of difference may have practical implications ; for example , with the aim to overcome the genetic defect ; the carriers of tcf7l2 t - allele might need higher doses of gliclazide , a sulfonylurea drug with good evidence base and safety profile [ 22 , 23 ] .","answer":"previous studies showed associations between variants in tcf7l2 gene and the therapeutic response to sulfonylureas .  all sulfonylureas stimulate insulin secretion by the closure of atp -

Haloalkane dehalogenases catalyze the hydrolysis of carbon-halogen bonds in various chlorinated, brominated and iodinated compounds. These enzymes have a conserved pair of halide-stabilizing residues that are important in substrate binding and stabilization of the transition state and the halide ion product via hydrogen bonding. In all previously known haloalkane dehalogenases, these residues are either a pair of tryptophans or a tryptophan-asparagine pair. The newly-isolated haloalkane dehalogenase DatA from Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 (EC 3.8.1.5) possesses a unique halide-stabilizing tyrosine residue, Y109, in place of the conventional tryptophan. A variant of DatA with the Y109W mutation was created and the effects of this mutation on the structure and catalytic properties of the enzyme were studied using spectroscopy and pre-steady-state kinetic experiments. Quantum mechanical and molecular dynamics calculations were used to obtain a detailed analysis of the hydrogen-bonding patterns within the active sites of the wild-type and the mutant, as well as of the stabilization of the ligands as the reaction proceeds. Fluorescence quenching experiments suggested that replacing the tyrosine with tryptophan improves halide binding by 3.7-fold, presumably as a result of the introduction of an additional hydrogen bond. Kinetic analysis revealed that the mutation affected the substrate specificity of the enzyme and reduced its K0.5 for selected halogenated substrates by a factor of 2-4, without impacting the rate-determining hydrolytic step. We conclude that DatA is the first natural haloalkane dehalogenase that stabilizes its substrate in the active site using only a single hydrogen bond, which is a new paradigm in catalysis by this enzyme family.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"carbon\\", \\"tryptophan\\", \\"halogen\\", \\"hydrogen\\", \\"tyrosine\\", \\"halide\\", \\"Haloalkane\\", \\"tryptophans\\", \\"asparagine\\", \\"haloalkane\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

like neutralinosit amounts to about @xmath56 , for higgsino  like neutralinos it is smaller .the resulting forward - backward asymmetry @xmath57 depends sensitively on the mixing character of the neutralinos .for higgsino - like neutralinos ( scen .( a ) ) the angular distribution is nearly forward backward symmetric with a minimum at @xmath58 for gaugino - like neutralinos ( scen .( b ) ) , however , the forward hemisphere is favoured ( table  1 ) .owing to the majorana character of the neutralinos the distribution @xmath59 of the opening angle between both outgoing leptons factorizes .the distributions are completely different for scenario ( a ) .( fig .  6 ) and ( b ) ( fig .  7 ) . for gaugino -

In this study, we present our initial experience using a standardized management algorithm. Data collection was performed on OHT patients with COVID-19 after March 10, 2020 (declaration of state of emergency in Massachusetts). Among the 358 OHT patients currently followed at our program, 5 patients (1.4%) tested positive for COVID-19 (median age 50 years [IQR, 49-58], duration post-OHT 21 years [IQR, 6-25], and 4 of 5 [80%] were men). Among the 5 OHT patients, 2 of 5 (20%) had mild disease and had no change in baseline immunosuppression therapy. Two of 5 (20%) had moderate disease and received remdesivir as part of a clinical trial and reduced immunosuppression therapy. One patient (20%) died prior to presenting to the hospital, consistent with 20% case fatality rate. Four patients (80%) are doing well 4 weeks post-discharge. In this small cohort of OHT patients with COVID-19, we report a 1.4% COVID-19 infection rate and 20% case fatality rate. All OHT patients managed under our clinical management algorithm had good short-term outcomes. Further study to estimate the true risk profile of OHT patients and validate the proposed management strategy is warranted.","answer":"[\\"Case Report\\"]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

We utilized a large data set of the rat brain “connectome” from the Brain Architecture Management System( 942 brain regions and over 5000 connections) and used statistical approaches to relate the data to the gene expression signatures of 17, 530 genes in 142 anatomical regions from the Allen Brain Atlas. Our analysis shows that adult gene expression signatures have a statistically significant relationship to connectivity. In particular, brain regions that have similar expression profiles tend to have similar connectivity profiles, and this effect is not entirely attributable to spatial correlations. In addition, brain regions which are connected have more similar expression patterns. Using a simple optimization approach, we identified a set of genes most correlated with neuroanatomical connectivity, and find that this set is enriched for genes involved in neuronal development and axon guidance. A number of the genes have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder. Our results have the potential to shed light on the role of gene expression patterns in influencing neuronal activity and connectivity, with potential applications to our understanding of brain disorders. Supplementary data are available at http://www. chibi. ubc. ca/ABAMS.Introduction:While the brain can be studied at many different scales and with many modalities, one of the most established is the study of brain regions and their connectivity. These “macroconnections” between neuroanatomically-defined brain regions are thought to number between 25, 000–100, 000 in the mammalian brain[1], forming a complex network. Knowledge of the “connectome” is used to diagnose neurological disorders such as ischemic stroke, to interpret brain imaging results and to computationally model the brain. There is also growing evidence of connectivity abnormalities in disorders such as autism and schizophrenia[2],[3],[4]. Because of the fundamental importance of the wiring of the brain, there has been a recent push to create more comprehensive “connectome” maps[5],[6], paralleling efforts to understand the brain at the level of genes. The most comprehensive studies of connectivity have been done in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans( at the level of single neurons) and the macaque monkey[7],[8]. Recent work has begun plumbing the properties of these networks, examining node degree distribution[9], network motifs[10], and modularity[11]. It has been shown that anatomical neighbours tend to be connected[12], and there is evidence that wiring cost partially explains network structure[13],[14]. There is also increasing interest in the integration of neuronal connectivity and information about genes. This is in part driven by the fact that many genes show spatially-restricted or varying expression in the nervous system, but in many cases the reasons for the expression patterns are not clear[15],[16],[17],[18]. The idea that gene expression is related to connectivity is not new. For example, the expression of a transmitter must be coupled with expression of appropriate receptors in the postsynaptic target. To regulate neurite outgrowth and plasticity hetero- and homophilic cell adhesion molecules require appropriate expression patterns in connected neurons[19],[20]. In a study of the mouse hippocampus, Dong et al.[21] identified seven genes which are differentially expressed between the dorsal and ventral CA1 field and have a correlated expression pattern in the corresponding projection fields in the lateral septal nucleus. The availability of detailed information on expression patterns in the mouse brain[15],[16],[17] suggests that a global examination of gene expression and connectivity in the mammalian brain would provide additional insights. While there is no large-scale analysis of gene expression and connectivity in the mammalian brain, three groups have examined this issue in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The groups used cellular level expression data for a few hundred genes and a neuron level connectivity map[8]. By combining the data, Kaufman et al.[22] used classification and Mantel tests to predict genes involved in synaptogenesis and axon guidance. They concluded that expression profiles of neurons “carry significant information about their connectivity”. Varadan et al.[23] used a different methodology to discover biologically meaningful gene sets that provide connectivity information. Within the resulting gene sets they found high levels of multivariate synergy, suggesting interacting genes are more important than single genes. In a third study, Baruch et al.[24] predicted a neuron's postsynaptic partners using expression patterns of a small number of interacting genes. In this paper we examine gene expression patterns and macroconnectivity in the adult rodent brain, using data from the Allen Brain Atlas[17] and the Brain Architecture Management System[25],[26]. Our results suggest that in the mammalian brain, as in Caenorhabditis elegans, there is a correlation between gene expression and connectivity, and the relevant genes are enriched for involvement in neuronal development and axon guidance.Discussion:Our analysis revealed a number of interesting relationships between gene expression and patterns of connectivity in the adult mammalian brain. Our key finding is that genes whose expression patterns carry information on connectivity are enriched for genes involved in neural development, and axon guidance in particular. While our results are based on analysis of the brains of rodents, it is of potential importance that many of the genes we identify have human homologs implicated in disorders of the nervous system including ASD. Because there is an increasing interest in the idea that ASD and other disorders are in part due to abnormalities in connectivity[4],[62], and given the heritability of many such disorders, the relationship between gene expression and connectivity is pertinent. The enrichment of homologs of autism candidate genes in our results suggests that these patterns could be relevant to the understanding of behavior in autism and potentially avenues for treatment. To our knowledge ours is the first study comparing gene expression and connectivity in mammals at a global level. Interestingly, a previous focused examination of the correlation between expression and connectivity for two brain regions identified some of the same genes we did. Dong et al.[21] examined correlations between genes that are differentially expressed between the dorsal and ventral hippocampus( which we were not able to treat as separate regions in our analysis). For nine of their genes, they observed matching expression patterns in a connected brain region, the lateral septal nucleus. Three of these seven genes appear on our connectivity correlation lists( Gpc3, Man1a, Wfs1); this is unlikely to occur by chance( p-value = 0. 0045, hypergeometric test). In contrast, none of the seven appear on the proximity gene list. We stress that because what we observe are correlations, it is difficult to ascribe a definite mechanism or meaning to the patterns. In addition, in absolute terms the Mantel test correlations may seem low when we considered all genes. However, we do obtain a correlation of 0. 65 between gene expression patterns and proximity-controlled incoming connectivity after gene selection. We also point out that at the neuron to neuron level in Caenorhabditis elegans, Kaufman et al.[22] reported statistically significant correlations of 0. 075 and 0. 176 between expression and incoming and outgoing connectivity, respectively. Thus the patterns we observe in the adult mammalian brain are at least as strong as those observed in previous studies. An obvious question is whether the signals we observe are strong enough to predict patterns of connectivity. Unfortunately, while the signals we observe are statistically significant, they are not strong enough to allow prediction of connections based on expression patterns. Kaufman et al.[22] attempted this with their data and achieved very low accuracy. Using similar data, Baruch et al.[24] attained statistically significant results in predicting the direction of connectivity between neurons known to be connected or which share a common synaptic partner. Using advanced imaging techniques on human subjects, Honey et al.[63] attempted to predict diffusion tensor imaging( DTI) based cortical connectivity from fMRI functional connectivity. By setting thresholds on functional connectivity, they achieved an AUC value of 0. 79 that could predict only ∼6% of inferred DTI connections[63]. Despite these limitations, our results suggest some underlying models that in turn provide some testable hypotheses. Many of the genes we find to be associated with connectivity patterns in the adult are thought to be primarily active in the developing brain, when large-scale connectivity is determined. The reasons for expression of these genes in the adult brain is not fully understood, though there is evidence in some cases that they continue to play roles in the maintenance or tuning of neuronal connectivity at finer scales[16],[64]. There is even less known about why the genes show regionally restricted patterns in the adult brain. Our results are the first to link the expression signatures of some of these genes to macroscopic connectivity. Our results have at least two possible biological interpretations. One is that the expression patterns in adulthood are a “residue” of the developmental pattern that reflects processes occurring when connectivity is laid down, but that the adult expression pattern is not causally related to connectivity at the scale we studied. An alternative is that the expression patterns in adulthood are functionally relevant with respect to connectivity, perhaps in modulating activity in certain pathways. The patterns we identified could be used to design experiments to distinguish between these alternatives. While we have provided evidence for a relationship between connectivity and gene expression in the mammalian brain, our analysis is surely hindered by the incompleteness of connectivity and expression information. There are many brain regions for which we had expression data but no connectivity. While some of these regions might never have been studied, there are many reports in the literature that are not included in the current connectivity databases. Advances in the generation of connectivity information from new experiments or from more complete use of existing reports will be essential. The availability of additional expression data would also improve our ability to interpret the patterns we observe. In particular, having detailed information on gene expression patterns during development, and their relationships to the developing projection patterns in the brain, could permit stronger inference of causal relationships. A final limitation is that the structural connections we use cannot be easily linked to specific states or functions of the brain. Because of this we could only interpret our results in the context of gene function information. It would be of interest to employ functional connectivity data to link gene expression to more dynamic and task specific states of the brain, especially in the context of genetic variation.","answer":"We tested the idea that the “wiring diagram” of the adult brain has a relationship with where genes are expressed .

Subsequent to the independent discovery of bacteriophage by Twort (1915) and d 'Hérelle (1917) , the first filamentous phage, f1, was isolated in Loeb (1960) and later characterized as a member of a larger group of phage (Ff, including f1, M13, and fd phage) specific for the E. coli conjugative F pilus (Hofschneider and Mueller-Jensen, 1963; Marvin and Hoffmann-Berling, 1963; Zinder et al., 1963; Salivar et al., 1964) . Soon thereafter, filamentous phage were discovered that do not use F-pili for entry (If and Ike; Meynell and Lawn, 1968; Khatoon et al., 1972) , and over time the list of known filamentous phage has expanded to over 60 members (Fauquet et al., 2005) , including temperate and Gram-positivetropic species. Work by multiple groups over the past 50 years has contributed to a relatively sophisticated understanding of filamentous phage structure, biology and life cycle (reviewed in Marvin, 1998; Rakonjac et al., 2011; Rakonjac, 2012) . In the mid-1980s, the principle of modifying the filamentous phage genome to display polypeptides as fusions to coat proteins on the virion surface was invented by Smith and colleagues (Smith, 1985; Parmley and Smith, 1988) . Based on the ideas described in Parmley and Smith (1988) , groups in California, Germany, and the UK developed phage-display platforms to create and screen libraries of peptide and folded-protein variants (Bass et al., 1990; Devlin et al., 1990; McCafferty et al., 1990; Scott and Smith, 1990; Breitling et al., 1991; Kang et al., 1991) . This technology allowed, for the first time, the ability to seamlessly connect genetic information with protein function for a large number of protein variants simultaneously, and has been widely and productively exploited in studies of proteinprotein interactions. Many excellent reviews are available on phage-display libraries and their applications (Kehoe and Kay, 2005; Bratkovic, 2010; Pande et al., 2010) . However, the phage also has a number of unique structural and biological properties that make it highly useful in areas of research that have received far less attention. Thus, the purpose of this review is to highlight recent and current work using filamentous phage in novel and nontraditional applications. Specifically, we refer to projects that rely on the filamentous phage as a key element, but whose primary purpose is not the generation or screening of phagedisplayed libraries to obtain binding polypeptide ligands. These tend to fall into four major categories of use: (i) filamentous phage as a vaccine carrier; (ii) engineered filamentous phage as a therapeutic biologic agent in infectious and chronic diseases; (iii) filamentous phage as a scaffold for bioconjugation and surface chemistry; and (iv) filamentous phage as an engine for evolving variants of displayed proteins with novel functions. A final section is dedicated to recent developments in filamentous phage ecology and phage-host interactions. Common themes shared amongst all these applications include the unique biological, immunological, and physicochemical properties of the phage, its ability to display a variety of biomolecules in modular fashion, and its relative simplicity and ease of manipulation. Nearly all applications of the filamentous phage depend on its ability to display polypeptides on the virion's surface as fusions to phage coat proteins ( Table 1) . The display mode determines the maximum tolerated size of the fused polypeptide, its copy number on the phage, and potentially, the structure of the displayed polypeptide. Display may be achieved by fusing DNA encoding a polypeptide of interest directly to the gene encoding a coat protein within the phage genome (type 8 display on pVIII, type 3 display on pIII, etc. ), resulting in fully recombinant phage. Much more commonly, however, only one copy of the coat protein is modified in the presence of a second, wild-type copy (e.g., type 88 display if both recombinant and wild-type pVIII genes are on the phage genome, type 8+8 display if the Parmley and Smith (1988), McConnell et al.

(2010) 1 Asterisks indicate non-functional copies of the coat protein are present in the genome of the helper phage used to rescue a phagemid whose coat protein has been fused to a recombinant polypeptide. 2 The copy number depends on polypeptide size; typically <1 copy per phage particle but for pVIII peptide display can be up to ∼15% of pVIII molecules in hybrid virions. 3 The total number of pVIII molecules depends on the phage genome size; one pVIII molecule is added for every 2.3 nucleotides in the viral genome. recombinant gene 8 is on a plasmid with a phage origin of replication) resulting in a hybrid virion bearing two different types of a given coat protein. Multivalent display on some coat proteins can also be enforced using helper phage bearing nonfunctional copies of the relevant coat protein gene (e.g., type 3 * +3 display). By far the most commonly used coat proteins for display are the major coat protein, pVIII, and the minor coat protein, pIII, with the major advantage of the former being higher copy number display (up to ∼15% of recombinant pVIII molecules in a hybrid virion, at least for short peptide fusions), and of the latter being the ability to display some folded proteins at an appreciable copy number (1-5 per phage particle). While pVIII display of folded proteins on hybrid phage is possible, it typically results in a copy number of much less than 1 per virion (Sidhu et al., 2000) . For the purposes of this review, we use the term \\"phage display\\" to refer to a recombinant filamentous phage displaying a single polypeptide sequence on its surface (or more rarely, bispecific display achieved via fusion of polypeptides to two different capsid proteins), and the term \\"phage-displayed library\\" to refer to a diverse pool of recombinant filamentous phage displaying an array of polypeptide variants (e.g., antibody fragments; peptides). Such libraries are typically screened by iterative cycles of panning against an immobilized protein of interest (e.g., antigen for phage-displayed antibody libraries; antibody for phage-displayed peptide libraries) followed by amplification of the bound phage in E. coli cells. Early work with anti-phage antisera generated for species classification purposes demonstrated that the filamentous phage virion is highly immunogenic in the absence of adjuvants (Meynell and Lawn, 1968 ) and that only the major coat protein, pVIII, and the minor coat protein, pIII, are targeted by antibodies (Pratt et al., 1969; Woolford et al., 1977) . Thus, the idea of using the phage as carrier to elicit antibodies against poorly immunogenic haptens or polypeptide was a natural extension of the ability to display recombinant exogenous sequences on its surface, which was first demonstrated by de la Cruz et al. (1988) . The phage particle's low cost of production, high stability and potential for high valency display of foreign antigen (via pVIII display) also made it attractive as a vaccine carrier, especially during the early stages of development of recombinant protein technology. Building upon existing peptide-carrier technology, the first filamentous phage-based vaccine immunogens displayed short amino acid sequences derived directly from proteins of interest as recombinant fusions to pVIII or pIII (de la Cruz et al., 1988) . As library technology was developed and refined, phage-based antigens displaying peptide ligands of monoclonal antibodies (selected from random peptide libraries using the antibody, thus simulating with varying degrees of success the antibody's folded epitope on its cognate antigen; Geysen et al., 1986; Knittelfelder et al., 2009) were also generated for immunization purposes, with the goal of eliciting anti-peptide antibodies that also recognize the native protein. Some of the pioneering work in this area used peptides derived from infectious disease antigens (or peptide ligands of antibodies against these antigens; Table 2) , including malaria and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). When displayed on phage, peptides encoding the repeat regions of the malarial circumsporozoite protein and merozoite surface protein 1 were immunogenic in mice and rabbits (de la Cruz et al., 1988; Greenwood et al., 1991; Willis et al., 1993; Demangel et al., 1996) , and antibodies raised against the latter cross-reacted with the full-length protein. Various peptide determinants (or mimics thereof) of HIV-1 gp120, gp41, gag, and reverse transcriptase were immunogenic when displayed on or conjugated to phage coat proteins (Minenkova et al., 1993; di Marzo Veronese et al., 1994; De Berardinis et al., 1999; Scala et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2001; van Houten et al., 2006 van Houten et al., , 2010 , and in some cases elicited antibodies that were able to weakly neutralize lab-adapted viruses (di Marzo Veronese et al., 1994; Scala et al., 1999) . The list of animal and human infections for which phage-displayed peptide immunogens have been developed as vaccine leads continues to expand and includes bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic pathogens ( Table 2) . While in some cases the results of these studies have been promising, antibody epitope-based peptide vaccines are no longer an area of active research for several reasons: (i) in many cases, peptides incompletely or inadequately mimic epitopes on folded proteins (Irving et al., 2010 ; see below); (ii) antibodies against a single epitope may be of limited utility, especially for highly variable pathogens (Van Regenmortel, 2012); and (iii) for pathogens for which protective immune responses are generated efficiently during natural infection, peptide vaccines offer few advantages over recombinant subunit and live vector vaccines, which have become easier to produce over time. More recently, peptide-displaying phage have been used in attempts to generate therapeutic antibody responses for chronic diseases, cancer, immunotherapy, and immunocontraception. Immunization with phage displaying Alzheimer's disease β-amyloid fibril peptides elicited anti-aggregating antibodies in mice and guinea pigs (Frenkel et al., 2000 (Frenkel et al., , 2003 Esposito et al., 2008; Tanaka et al., 2011) , possibly reduced amyloid plaque formation in mice (Frenkel et al., 2003; Solomon, 2005; Esposito et al., 2008) , and may have helped maintain cognitive abilities in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (Lavie et al., 2004) ; however, it remains unclear how such antibodies are proposed to cross the blood-brain barrier. Yip et al. (2001) found that antibodies raised in mice against an ERBB2/HER2 peptide could inhibit breast-cancer cell proliferation. Phage displaying peptide ligands of an anti-IgE antibody elicited antibodies that bound purified IgE molecules (Rudolf et al., 1998) , which may be useful in allergy immunotherapy. Several strategies for phage-based contraceptive vaccines have been proposed for control of animal populations. For example, immunization with phage displaying follicle-stimulating hormone peptides on pVIII elicited antibodies that impaired the fertility of mice and ewes (Abdennebi et al., 1999) . Phage displaying or chemically Rubinchik and Chow (2000) conjugated to sperm antigen peptides or peptide mimics (Samoylova et al., 2012a,b) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Samoylov et al., 2012) are also in development. For the most part, peptides displayed on phage elicit antibodies in experimental animals ( Table 2) , although this depends on characteristics of the peptide and the method of its display: pIII fusions tend toward lower immunogenicity than pVIII fusions (Greenwood et al., 1991) possibly due to copy number differences (pIII: 1-5 copies vs. pVIII: estimated at several hundred copies; Malik et al., 1996) .Question: What are filamentous bacteriophages genera Inovirua and Plectrovirus?","answer":"non-enveloped, rod-shaped viruses of Escherichia coli whose long helical capsids encapsulate a single-stranded circular DNA genome."},{"question":"You are presented with a paragraph from a COVID-19 literature.

This study evaluated and compared the effectiveness of two different off-season , short-term basketball training programs on physical and technical abilities of young basketball players . Twenty-seven adolescent basketball players ( 14.7+/-0.5 years ; Tanner stage : 3.5+/-0.5 ) were randomly divided into a specialized basketball training group ( SP , n=10 ) , a mixed basketball plus conditioning training group ( MX , n=10 ) and a control group ( n=7 ) . Training included five sessions per week ( 100-120 min each ) and was performed for 4 weeks . Maximal oxygen uptake was similarly improved after SP ( 4.9+/-1.8 % ) and MX ( 4.9+/-1.4 % ) , but there was no effect on ventilatory threshold . Peak and mean power output measured during the Wingate test were also improved by a similar magnitude after SP ( 21+/-5 % ) and MX ( 15+/-6 % ) . Trunk muscle endurance was equally increased ( SP : 23+/-4 % , MX : 25+/-5 % ) , but arms endurance was improved significantly more after MX ( 50+/-11 % ) compared to SP ( 11+/-14 % , p < 0.05 ) . Performance in four basketball technical skills was similarly increased ( by 17-27 % ) in both groups , with a tendency for greater improvement of the SP groups in the technical skills of shooting and passing . These results indicate that a SP basketball training program , performed exclusively on-court was as effective as a MX training program in terms of aerobic and anaerobic fitness improvement . Furthermore , the decrease of the total on-court training time in the MX group resulted in a tendency for a smaller improvement of basketball technical skills .

Despite these functional exchanges during perception, there is little shared activity between early and late visual regions at rest. How interactions emerge between regions encompassing distinct levels of the visual hierarchy remains unknown. Here we combined neuroimaging, non-invasive cortical stimulation and computational modelling to characterize changes in functional interactions across widespread neural networks before and after local inhibition of primary visual cortex or FEF. We found that stimulation of early visual cortex selectively increased feedforward interactions with FEF and extrastriate visual areas, whereas identical stimulation of the FEF decreased feedback interactions with early visual areas. Computational modelling suggests that these opposing effects reflect a fast-slow timescale hierarchy from sensory to association areas.Introduction:The primate visual system is a hierarchical network of feedforward and feedback connections that supports visual perception, object recognition and selective attention( Gilbert, 2013). At the earliest level of the visual hierarchy, the primary visual cortex receives input from the lateral geniculate nucleus and propagates this information to higher association areas including the posterior parietal cortex, ventral temporal cortex and frontal eye fields( FEF)( Hubel and Wiesel, 1962; Felleman and Van Essen, 1991; Van Essen and Maunsell, 1983; Maunsell and van Essen, 1983). During active perception, neural signals originating in these later cortical areas provide top-down modulation of activity in early visual areas, depending on factors such as expectation and context( Gilbert, 2013; Felleman and Van Essen, 1991; Moore and Armstrong, 2003; Bastos et al., 2015). Functional interactions between early sensory regions and later association areas have been investigated in humans using task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging( fMRI)( Bressler et al., 2008; Vossel et al., 2012). This work has demonstrated that task demands play an important role in determining the nature of the interactions between early and late visual cortex( Gilbert, 2013). For example, studies combining fMRI with transcranial magnetic stimulation( TMS) during performance of visual tasks have shown that stimulation of the FEF can modulate neural activity in several visual areas, including the primary visual cortex( area V1)( Bressler et al., 2008; Ruff et al., 2006, 2008). Increments in the strength of excitatory TMS over the right FEF have been shown to increase neural activity in early retinotopic cortex representing the peripheral visual field, and to reduce activity in central visual-field representations( Ruff et al., 2006). This neurophysiological effect confers a perceptual advantage for detection of stimuli in the visual periphery relative to the fovea( Ruff et al., 2006). Despite evidence for dynamic bidirectional interactions between FEF and early visual cortex during task-related visual processing, numerous findings from resting-state fMRI( rsfMRI) studies, in both human and non-human primates, suggest there is little or no functional coupling between these regions in the absence of active task demands( i. e., in the resting-state)( Vincent et al., 2007; Belcher et al., 2013; Damoiseaux et al., 2006; Yeo et al., 2011; Power et al., 2011; Mantini et al., 2013; Gordon et al., 2016). At rest, FEF belongs to extensive networks of fronto-parietal regions( Yeo et al., 2011; Power et al., 2011), whereas the early visual cortex, including area V1, belongs to a primary visual network encompassing occipital and inferior parietal regions( Yeo et al., 2011; Power et al., 2011; Gordon et al., 2016). Despite this apparent functional segregation between visual networks encompassing early visual cortex and FEF at rest, the nature of any latent interactions between them remains unknown. Likewise, the neural principles facilitating the emergence of integration between segregated regions at opposing ends of the visual cortical hierarchy remain unclear. Here we combined rsfMRI and non-invasive brain stimulation to examine the causal influence of perturbations of local neural activity within early and late visual areas – specifically areas V1/V2 and FEF – in the absence of visual task demands. Across two separate imaging sessions, we employed continuous theta-burst TMS( Huang et al., 2005) to inhibit intrinsic neural activity either within the right occipital pole or within the right FEF. We recorded resting-state brain activity immediately before and after TMS, and examined the influence of this perturbation on functional and effective connectivity between the targeted regions and the rest of the brain. We also employed computational modelling to provide candidate mechanisms for expected changes in interactions between cortical regions following local stimulation. Based on recent empirical( Hasson et al., 2008; Murray et al., 2014; Bassett et al., 2013; Lerner et al., 2011; Honey et al., 2012; Gauthier et al., 2012) and computational( Gollo et al., 2015; Chaudhuri et al., 2015) work we tested the hypothesis that a temporal hierarchy of timescales, recapitulating the hierarchical organization of neuronal receptive fields, can explain the effects of local stimulation on inter-regional connectivity. According to the model, activity in higher regions such as FEF fluctuates at a slower temporal scale than activity in early sensory regions such as V1/V2( Murray et al., 2014; Honey et al., 2012; Chaudhuri et al., 2015). We simulated the effects of local inhibition of early and late visual areas to test whether the proposed temporal gradient from sensory areas( fast) to association areas( slow) matched the observed changes in connectivity following local cortical perturbations in human participants. Our experimental and modelling results suggest that local inhibition of early visual cortex reduces the discrepancy in endogenous synchronization between lower and higher levels of the visual cortical hierarchy, whereas inhibition of FEF increases the discrepancy. Our work provides novel insights into the neural mechanisms that underlie the effects of local inhibition on large-scale brain dynamics.Discussion:We examined dynamic reconfigurations of intrinsic interactions between cortical areas at lower and higher ends of the visual hierarchy in humans following local stimulation with TMS. We applied inhibitory theta-burst stimulation via TMS to one of two regions – early visual cortex and FEF – within the right hemisphere, and examined changes in functional and effective connectivity in the resting-state. Local inhibitory TMS of these regions generated opposing patterns of connectivity between early and late areas within the cortical hierarchy. These distinct effects are consistent with an intrinsic timescale-based cortical hierarchy( Murray et al., 2014; Bassett et al., 2013; Lerner et al., 2011; Honey et al., 2012; Gauthier et al., 2012; Gollo et al., 2015; Chaudhuri et al., 2015), with early visual areas( V1/V2) exhibiting shorter timescales than those of higher areas( such as FEF). By incorporating these timescale effects, the computational model provides supporting evidence for opposing changes in diffuse connectivity following focal inhibitory TMS in the human brain. This finding highlights that inter-regional effects of focal TMS can be predicted by the hierarchical organization of timescales across the cerebral cortex. At baseline, prior to inhibitory stimulation, neural activity in early visual cortex was anticorrelated with activity in the FEF bilaterally. Previous neuroimaging work in humans and monkey has suggested little or no functional coupling between FEF and V1/V2 in the resting state( Vincent et al., 2007; Belcher et al., 2013; Damoiseaux et al., 2006; Yeo et al., 2011; Power et al., 2011; Mantini et al., 2013; Gordon et al., 2016). For instance, areas V1 and V2 lie within a primary visual network that does not include FEF( Yeo et al., 2011). Our results support previous work by showing a functional segregation between early and late areas within the visual cortical hierarchy at rest. This finding is consistent with the notion that task-induced changes in sensory visual areas may drive the emergence of functional integration between levels of the visual cortical hierarchy( Ekstrom et al., 2008; Roelfsema, 2006). A novel finding of our study is that inhibition of early visual cortex resulted in the emergence of positive correlations between this region and FEF, along with other extrastriate and parietal visual areas. Previous studies have investigated intrinsic reconfigurations of large-scale neural systems following focal perturbations of peripheral sensorimotor regions( e. g., Cocchi et al., 2015; O'Shea et al., 2007; Grefkes and Fink, 2011). In line with our results, fMRI studies have shown that local perturbation of primary motor areas can lead to recruitment of related areas( O'Shea et al., 2007; Grefkes and Fink, 2011; Cocchi et al., 2015). For example, inhibitory TMS of the primary motor cortex in healthy adults has recently been shown to increase the strength of resting-state functional connectivity within the sensorimotor system( Cocchi et al., 2015). Our finding that unilateral inhibition of early visual cortex increases the positive coupling with FEF and other visual areas adds to a growing literature suggesting that local perturbations of neural activity in peripheral nodes recruit functionally related brain regions( Cocchi et al., 2015; O'Shea et al., 2007; Grefkes and Fink, 2011; Bestmann et al., 2010). Specifically, our computational modelling suggests that the effect of inhibitory TMS of early visual cortex might be due to slowing of intrinsic timescales within V1/V2, so that they become closer to the slow intrinsic fluctuations of higher cortical regions such as the parietal cortex and FEF( Murray et al., 2014; Honey et al., 2012; Gollo et al., 2015; Chaudhuri et al., 2015). In contrast to the increased positive coupling apparent after inhibition of early visual cortex, an identical inhibitory TMS protocol delivered over the right FEF led to decoupling between the target region and bilateral early visual cortex. Results from the DCM analysis suggest that such functional decoupling was related to a significant decrease in feedback signals from FEF to early visual cortex. In keeping with the neural mechanism proposed to explain increased connectivity following the inhibition of V1/V2, results from our computational model suggest that the observed reduction in feedback modulation from FEF to V1/V2 can be explained by a further slowing of local FEF dynamics by TMS. The observed changes in connectivity following inhibitory TMS may therefore be explained in terms of a reduction in synchronization discrepancy following local stimulation of V1/V2 and an increase in synchronization discrepancy following stimulation of FEF. Within this broad context, preliminary analyses suggest that there are a host of topographical specificities and nuances that accompany virtual simulations. Further work is needed to address the specificity of our model and the source of possible discrepancies between virtual and empirical findings. Our findings also reveal a relationship between the magnitude of local signal change and remote modulations in intrinsic functional connectivity. We found that TMS-induced changes in local BOLD signal amplitude at the stimulation site were related to remote modulations in functional connectivity. This suggests that variations in ongoing low-frequency( <0. 1 Hz) fluctuations may be a marker of TMS-induced modulation of widespread cortical connectivity. The dynamic integration of information between sensory and association regions of the cortex is essential for normal brain function. Here we combined functional brain imaging, neural stimulation and computational modelling to elucidate the neural mechanisms that support the emergence and dissolution of interactions between cortical regions within the human visual system following local perturbations in neural activity. Our results suggest that the selective effect of local inhibitory TMS on diffuse patterns of connectivity can be accounted for by an intrinsic hierarchical ordering of cortical timescales( Murray et al., 2014; Honey et al., 2012; Gollo et al., 2015).","answer":"In humans , the parts of the brain involved in vision are organized into distinct regions that are arranged into a hierarchy . Each of these regions contains neurons that are specialized for a particular role , such as responding to shape , color or motion . To actually ‘see’ an object , these different regions must communicate with each other and exchange information via connections between lower and higher levels of the hierarchy . However , it remains unclear how these connections work . A brain region called the primary visual cortex is the lowest level of the visual cortical hierarchy as it is the first area to receive information from the eye . This region then passes information to higher regions in the hierarchy including the frontal eye fields ( FEF ) , which help to control visual attention and eye movements . In turn , the FEF is thought to provide ‘feedback’ to the primary visual cortex . Cocchi et al . examined how the FEF and primary visual cortex communicate with the rest of the brain by temporarily inhibiting the activity of these regions in human volunteers . The experiments show that inhibiting the primary visual cortex increased communication between this region and higher level visual areas . On the other hand , inhibiting the FEF reduced communication between this region and lower visual areas . Computer simulations revealed that inhibiting particular brain regions alters communication between visual regions by changing the timing of local neural activity . In the simulations , inhibiting the primary visual cortex slows down neural activity in that region , leading to better communication with higher regions , which already operate on slower timescales . By contrast , inhibition of the FEF reduces its influence on lower visual regions by increasing the difference in timescales of neural activity between these regions . The next step is to determine whether similar mechanisms regulate changes in the activity of neural networks outside of the visual system ."},{"question":"Given a short query with keyphrases about a research idea in 2018 in the domain of artificial intelligence, recommend the relevant datasets to validate the research idea from options provided.

No significant adverse effects or complications were observed during the pregnancies, and all three patients delivered healthy newborns.Despite these favorable outcomes, the use of these two biological agents must follow international recommendations. Their use is not currently allowed during pregnancy except in cases where the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetusPREGNANCY:                          Azathioprine, chloroquine, cyclosporin A, prednisolone, sulfasalazine, tacrolimus and cyclophosphamide (only after the second trimester) may be administered during pregnancy. Biologics should be avoided unless there is a treatment need in cases of uncontrolled disease activity.As such, it is recommended that abatacept, rituximab and tocilizumab be withheld prior to pregnancy; however, tumour necrosis factor inhibitors and anakinra may be continued until conception.Case reports on abatacept, tocilizumab or anakinra in pregnancy are not conclusive.The very limited experience with abatacept, tocilizumab or anakinra in pregnancy allows no statement as to their compatibility with pregnancy. At present use of biological agents throughout pregnancy cannot be recommended.Drugs recommended to be stopped before pregnancy include methotrexate and leflunomide, plus the biologics: anti-TNF agents, rituximab and abatacept.Whereas methotrexate, leflunomide, abatacept and rituximab must be withdrawn before a planned pregnancy, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and bisphosphonates can be continued until conception.Pregnancy experience with abatacept and rituximab is still too limited to prove their safety for the developing fetus. They must be withdrawn before a planned pregnancy.Prophylactic withdrawal of drugs before pregnancy is mandatory for abatacept, rituximab, LEF and MMF.","answer":"no"},{"question":"You will be provided with the titles and abstracts of a collection of medical RCT reports studying a clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of an intervention on some medical outcome.

nasa antenna at hartebeesthoek in south africa .the window of opportunity to create an african network of vlbi - capable radio telescopes from redundant large satellite antennas exists now .this african vlbi network ( avn or afvn ) would initially work with existing vlbi arrays such as the european vlbi network ( evn ) , but could operate independently if sufficient antennas become available .such a network would bring new science opportunities to participating countries on a short time scale , enable participation in ska pathfinder development and science , and would help create the environment for bringing the square kilometre array ( ska ) to africa .it would provide a ready made vlbi extension for the meerkat radio telescope currently being developed as an ska precursor .from the 1960 s , communication via satellites orbiting the earth was introduced to carry voice , data and tv signals , to supplement undersea cables . the radio bands allocated for this were 5.925 @xmath0 6.425 ghz for uplink and 3.700 @xmath0 4.200 ghz for downlink .these are within the frequency range known as \`\` c - band '' .intelsat defines earth stations for this band as standard a , b , f or h depending on their technical characteristics @xcite .initially a standard a antenna had to be at least 30  m in diameter , and the antennas built in africa from 1970 to 1985 are this size . from 1985 new technologyenabled satellite transmitter power to increase and the required size was greatly reduced .ska africa partner countries identified with large antennas are south africa ( 3 antennas ) , ghana , kenya , madagascar and zambia .other african countries in which large antennas have been located are algeria ( 2 ) , benin , cameroon ( 2 ) , congo peoples republic , egypt ( 2 ) , ethiopia , malawi , morocco , niger , nigeria ( 3 ) , senegal , tunisia , uganda and zimbabwe .these two groups are shown in fig .[ fig : antenna_map ] .in addition , gabon probably has one and one is reported in the congo democratic republic . the antenna in mozambiquewas dismantled and probably also the one in togo .south africa s ska partners in africa are botswana , ghana , kenya , madagascar , mauritius , mozambique , namibia and zambia .locations of identified large satellite earth station antennas in africa ]      operational converted antennas are the 30  m ceduna antenna in australia @xcite and the 32  m yamaguchi antenna in japan @xcite .the warkworth 30  m antenna in new zealand was handed over for conversion on 19 november 2010 @xcite . in peruthe sicaya 32  m antenna is being converted with assistance from the yamaguchi team and saw first light in march 2011 @xcite .three antennas at the goonhilly downs station in the uk decommissioned in 2008 are proposed for conversion for use with e - merlin and the evn @xcite . on 10may 2011 it was announced that the 32  m elfordstown antenna outside cork in ireland is to be converted @xcite .widely separated radio telescopes operating together create a virtual telescope equal in size to the project distance , or baseline , between the telescopes .the angular resolution of a telescope depends on its size , so the larger the separation , the better the resolution . practically , to create good images a number of telescopes are needed , separated by small , medium and large distances .the hartrao 26  m radio telescope is valuable in providing long baselines to radio telescope arrays in on other continents , e.g. europe ( european vlbi network - evn ) and australia ( australia telescope long baseline array - at - lba ) , and thus high angular resolution imaging .however , the large distance between the south african telescope and the others makes for less than ideal imaging .it would be helpful to have antennas filling the gap between south africa and europe and south africa and australia ( for example ) and the image quality would be substantially improved .they would be a powerful addition to the radio telescope arrays on other continents .    to create an interferometer able to operate independently to produce images ,a minimum of four antennas are needed to provide both phase and amplitude closure .thus a minimal african vlbi network able to operate independently of the radio telescopes on other continents could be formed if four suitable antennas were brought into use on the continent and on neighbouring islands .science capability would improve substantially if more large antennas could join the network . with four antennas ,50% of the phase information and 33% of the amplitude information can be recovered ; with ten antennas these rise to 80% and 78% respectively @xcite .astronomical objects suitable for study by vlbi are those that are radio - bright and of small angular size. objects of very large physical size meet this requirement if they are quite distant , and radio galaxies and quasars are examples .radio - bright supernovae in external galaxies are good examples of objects whose evolution can be studied with vlbi .masers in star - forming regions in the milky way are examples of nearby bright , compact sources .methanol masers at 6.668 ghz and 12.178 ghz are of particular interest currently . repeated mapping would help in investigating the causes of their variability , especially those found to be showing regular variations .measurement of their annual parallaxes by repeated vlbi observations enables their distances to be determined , and thus the locations of the spiral arms in the milky way , where these occur , to be measured accurately .this is only being done by northern vlbi arrays currently , leaving the fourth quadrant of the milky way , in the far southern skies , so far unmapped by this method .distances to pulsars can be obtained by astrometric vlbi .transient sources and gamma - ray bursts are all potential targets . the on - going study of southern hemisphere radio galaxies ( tanami project ) would be enhanced with extra telescopes able to see the southern skies .microquasars in the milky way are targets , as are radio - loud interacting binary stars such as circinus x-1.    spacecraft in interplanetary space and at other planets that are equipped with 8.4 ghz frequency - stable transmitters are being used for precise spacecraft position determination and for study of the interplanetary medium .this technique is known as the planetary radio interferometry and doppler experiment ( pride ) .the hartrao 26  m telescope , and others , are regularly observing the venus express ( vex ) spacecraft in orbit around venus for this purpose . the russian phobos - grunt mission to mars moon phobosis due for launch late in 2011 and will use this technique . converted satellite antennas with 8.4 ghz receivers in africa would be good for this owing to their collecting area and location near the equator .antennas equipped with dual 2.3 + 8.4 ghz receivers would be able to participate in geodetic and astrometric vlbi with the current generation of radio telescopes carrying out this research .this technique provides a very precise absolute location for the telescope , which can be transferred to co - located relative position measuring systems such as the global navigation satellite systems gps and glonass , and the laser ranging and doris systems used to obtain precise measurements of satellite orbits .the only vlbi array that runs essentially continuously is the us very long baseline array ( vlba ) .the evn now runs much more frequently than the traditional three four - week sessions per year of the past , with monthly e - vlbi ( real - time data streaming to the correlator ) and target of opportunity ( too ) vlbi .however there would still be substantial non - vlbi time available for operation of each telescope as a stand - alone instrument .the time available for single - dish astronomy would be valuable for student training purposes and for selected research projects .techniques that could be developed would be radiometry - measuring the brightness of broad - band emission sources , spectroscopy - measuring emission and absorption line strengths , and pulsar timing - measuring the arrival times of pulses from neutron stars . establishing a capability for unattended queue - scheduled single - dish observing ( as on the hartrao 26  m telescope ) would greatly assist in permitting time series to be built up of the behaviour of scientifically interesting variable sources that can be observed with these techniques .intelsat documentation and internet mapping services using high resolution photography of the earth s surface enabled the current existence of the large antennas to be confirmed .postage stamps commemorating their inauguration were another valuable source of information .government level contact has been made with some of the countries by dst to further investigate the possibility of conversion .ghana was one of those approached , and was quick to seize the opportunity .this opportunity is a direct result of the african ska project .      the ghanaian government and vodafone , the owners of the kuntunse satellite earth station outside accra , have agreed to convert the 32  m antenna at the station for radio astronomy .this antenna has been out of service for about ten years ; an adjacent 16  m antenna is carrying the remaining satellite traffic . a hartrao team and prof .michael jones from oxford university visited kuntunse in march 2011 for an initial feasibility investigation , which indicated that it was in a suitable condition to proceed ( fig .[ fig : kuntunse ] ) .a hartrao / ska africa team visited in may to assist in starting the rehabilitation .this antenna is located roughly half way between south africa and europe .[ fig : uv_kuntunse ] shows how it fills the gap in uv coverage for vlbi of the evn with hartebeesthoek .it is 6  north of the equator and so it can see the entire plane of the milky way and almost the entire sky .vlbi uv diagram for a source at + 20declination .the red tracks show how the kuntunse antenna improves the uv coverage by filling the gap between europe and south africa . ]vlbi uv diagram for a source at + 20declination .the red tracks show how the kuntunse antenna improves the uv coverage by filling the gap between europe and south africa . ]the drive systems of out of service antennas will generally need some rectification , and this is in process with the kuntunse antenna .more challenging is the development of radio astronomy receiver systems .the initial aim is to build receivers for operation in radio astronomy bands within the original intelsat band range , possibly re - using the existing microwave feed horn .the most commonly used frequency band for vlbi in the evn is 4.8  5.1 ghz ; it falls between the current transmit and receive bands of the antenna and should not be difficult to implement with the existing feed .the 6.7 ghz methanol maser line lies a little above the feed design upper frequency and tests will be needed to see if it works at this frequency .wide ( octave ) band feeds and multi - band feeds are now commonplace . a feed covering 4.5 to 9 ghz ,either continuously or only in the relevant radio astronomy bands , would include the two bands already discussed and the 8.4 ghz vlbi band and would permit a wide range of science to be done .various options exist for developing capability outside these bands .the antenna design is the so - called \`\` beam waveguide '' in which large diameter pipes with 45  mirrors pass the signal to a focus in the room below the antenna , where the receiver is located .most of the african antennas are of this design .it comes with some advantages and disadvantages compared to the cassegrain design widely used on radio telescopes of this size , but the technical issues are solvable .the potential for converting obsolete large antennas for radio astronomy has been recognised world - wide .the opportunity exists for african countries to re - use these expensive assets that are becoming redundant to promote science development on the continent , at relatively low cost .lastnum    intelsat , _ intelsat earth station standards ( iess ) document iess-207 ( rev .4 ) _ , 2005 , ( luxembourg : intelsat ) , http://www.intelsat.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/iess-207e.pdf mcculloch p. m. , ellingsen s. p. , jauncey d. l. , carter s. j. b. , cimo g. , lovell j. e. j. , and dodson r. g. , 2005 , _ astron j _ , * 129 * , 2034      mansfield i. , 2010 , _ telecom new zealand converts satellite dish into radio telescope _ , http://www.cellular-news.com/story/46534.php finn e. , 2011 , _ peru : interstellar contact made in huancayo observatory _ , http://archive.peruthisweek.com/news-14300-environmentnature-peru-interstellar-contact-made-huancayo-observatory heywood i. , kloeckner h .-, beswick r. , garrington s. t. , hatchell j. , hoare m. g. , jarvis m. j. , jones i. , muxlow t. w. b. , and rawlings s. , 2011 , _ astronomy with megastructures : joint science with e -

For example, molybdenum-catalyzed allylic substitution reactions of heteroatom nucleophiles are unknown and largely limited only to carbon-carbon bond formation procedures (Fig. 1A, le). 4 Furthermore, the substrate scope with respect to the allylic electrophile has also remained unchanged and restricted to the ones that provide products containing a tertiary center at the allylic position. 5 Regardless of the longstanding interest in the formation of carbonheteroatom bonds within the synthetic organic community, as well as the advancement of other transition-metalcatalyzed reactions to provide heteroatom bearing quaternary and/or tertiary allylic centers, 6 molybdenum-catalyzed allylic substitution reactions that provide products containing such a stereocenter remain prominently absent from the literature and yet to be discovered (Fig. 1A, right). 7 Due to the high importance of allylic sulfones as pharmaceuticals 8 and synthetic candidates, 9 organic chemists have recently been designing catalytic C-S bond cleavage procedures as a new tool for carbon-carbon bond formation through Suzuki cross-coupling 10 and/or allylic substitution reactions. 11 Despite the considerable development realized in this area, allylic sulfone formation is still a challenging task and conned to the use of transition metal-catalyzed allylic sulfonylation procedures. 12,13 However, using these procedures for the synthesis of allylic sulfones containing tetrasubstituted carbon centers is limited and largely unexplored. 14 Therefore, at the beginning of our study it was unclear whether a molybdenum-catalyzed allylic substitution could ever be implemented with a heteroatom (sodium sulnate) nucleophile or even with a,a-disubstituted allylic precursors. If successful, such unexplored areas of allylic substitution chemistry might not only provide an opportunity to realize currently inaccessible chemical space (carbonheteroatom bond formation) in molybdenum-catalyzed allylic substitution, but also provide a new synthetic approach for rapidly generating quaternary all-carbon centers through Suzuki cross-coupling of the sulfone functionality. As part of our ongoing program in developing molybdenum-catalyzed allylic substitution technology and our continued interest in the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of quaternary stereocenters, 14a,15 we were attracted to this unmet challenge and report herein the successful implementation of this idea (Fig. 1B). The salient features of this process are the atom-economic procedures, high regioselectivity, and excellent functional group tolerance for both sulnate salt and tertiary allylic carbonates, even in the context of late-stage functionalization. Furthermore, the high reactivity of tertiary allylic sulfones as a new class of electrophiles to yield structurally diverse products containing quaternary all-carbon centers through Suzuki crosscoupling is a special characteristic feature of this catalytic system (Fig. 1C). 10a</p>Results and discussion<p>Our optimization began by evaluating the allylic substitution of tertiary allylic carbonate 1a, readily prepared from the corresponding alcohol on a large scale, with sodium benzenesulnate 2a (Table 1). Interestingly, a disappointing amount of either 3aa or 4aa was detected under reaction conditions previously reported for other molybdenum-catalyzed allylic substitution reactions. 4 Aer several experiments, we concluded that a combination of the inexpensive commercially available Mo(CO) 6 precursor and 2,2 0 -bipyridine as a ligand (L1) 17 in EtOH at 60 C afforded 3aa in 92% yield upon isolation with excellent branched to linear selectivity (3aa/4aa ¼ >99 : 1). Amongst all of the ligands utilized, 2,2 0 -bipyridine motifs were crucial for achieving the targeted transformation. While excellent reactivity towards 3aa was found with 2,2 0 -bipyridines and 6,6 0 -dimethyl-2,2 0 -bipyridine, better yields were obtained for the rst one (entries 1-7). Interestingly, the bench-stable terpyridine L7 failed to provide product 3aa. These results indicate that the coordination geometry of the ligand dictates the reactivity, with 2,2 0 -bipyridine ligands being particularly suited for the high yield and selectivity of 3aa. Subtle changes in the  Table 2 Sodium sulfinate substrate scope a,b,c</p><p>molybdenum precursor and/or solvent, however, had a negative inuence on the reaction, consistently providing lower yields if any (entries 8-14). As anticipated, control experiments revealed that all of the reaction parameters were necessary for the reaction to occur (entry 15). With reliable access to 3aa, we next turned our attention to examine the generality of our newly developed molybdenumcatalyzed regioselective sulfonylation of tertiary allylic electrophiles with sodium sulnate by using the Mo/L1 catalyst system as shown in Table 2. In all cases analysed for sulnate salts (2), excellent reactivity and selectivity was observed. Both the electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents on the aromatic ring of the sulnate salts react smoothly with 1a, affording the corresponding a,a-disubstituted allylic products in high yields (3aa-3ap). Sodium sulnates with bulky naphthyl (3aq), quinoline (3ar), 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (3as), and heteroaryl (3at, 3au) moieties were also tolerated under the current optimized conditions. Likewise, the targeted tertiary allylic sulfone formation could be extended to sulnate salts with alkyl substituents. Both primary and secondary alkyl substituted sodium sulnates worked well to provide a,a-disubstituted allylic sulfones in high yields (3av-3ay). Furthermore, a more functionalized sodium sulnate 2z, when used as the sulfonylation partner, the branched product 3az was obtained in 72% of isolated yield. The reaction leading to tertiary allylic sulfone 3aa was easily scaled up to gram-scale without signicant decrease in yield. Of particular note is that, almost in all cases, the reactions proceeded with excellent branched regioselectivity (>99 : 1).</p><p>We then focused on investigating the scope of the a,adisubstituted allylic carbonates and the results obtained were compiled in Table 3. Tertiary allylic carbonate with simple propyl substituent (1b) reacted efficiently with sodium benze-nesulnate (2a) to deliver the branched allylic sulfone 3ba in high yield (87%). However, allylic carbonate with a cyclohexyl moiety afforded the desired branched product in comparatively low yield (24%, 3ca) due to the steric hindrance problem. However, tertiary allylic carbonate (1d) having a longer alkyl chain provided the desired product even at high yield (91%, 3da). When tertiary allylic carbonates 1e, 1f, 1g and 1h with different groups on the alkyl chain were coupled with sulnate salt 2a, high yields of the branched allylic products were obtained (85-96%, 3ea, 3fa, 3ga and 3ha). Notably, various common functional groups such as Cl (1i), benzyl (1j), benzoyl (1k), thioether (1l), acetal (1m), and carbonate (1n) on the alkyl chain of the tertiary allylic carbonates were tolerated, and the sulfonylation branched products (3ia-3na) were isolated in high yields (82-94%). In addition, the unprotected hydroxy group on the alkyl chain of the tertiary allylic carbonates 1o and 1p do not interfere with productive tertiary allylic sulfone formation (3oa and 3pa), thus providing opportunities for further derivatization. Notably, the reaction can be easily applied within the context of late-stage functionalization, supported by the formation of branched allylic sulfone 3qa, derived from pentoxifylline. As expected, the allylic sulfonylation of phenyl substituted allylic carbonate occurred exclusively at the lesshindered position. The present optimized conditions were unsatisfactory with such substrates and provided the desired branched product (3ra) with a low branched to linear ratio (b/l ¼ 1 : 5); indicating some (steric) limitation of the current protocol. Besides methyl-substituted tertiary allylic substrates 1a-1r, other alkyl or aryl substituted substrates provide only starting materials when used under the optimized conditions, indicating some limitation of the present protocol.</p><p>In order to illustrate the synthetic utility of these elusive tertiary allylic sulfones, we focused on the reaction of a,adisubstituted allylic carbonate (1h), and sodium sulnate 2az, to achieve the formal synthesis of (AE)-agelasidine A. 18 The desired tertiary allylic sulfone 3haz was isolated in 84% yield under the standard conditions (Fig. 1A). This compound (3haz) can be readily converted to (AE)-agelasidine A by following the literature procedure. 13f We further demonstrate that the current methodology can be utilized to prepare other related compounds containing sulfone-bearing quaternary carbon centers. 19 Due to their ambiphilic nature, allylic sulfones are synthetically important electrophiles and have recently been utilized in Suzuki cross-coupling 10a as well as allylic substitution reactions. 11d However, selective cross-coupling of tertiary allylic sulfones remains highly challenging in Suzuki-Miyaura crosscoupling reactions. 10 Indeed, we employed our tertiary allylic sulfone product 3ga along with typical boronic acids as  a coupling partner in order to achieve the formal synthesis of (AE)-sporochnol, 20 and (AE)-bakuchiol, 21 both of which are natural products possessing a quaternary all-carbon center. Our synthesis is illustrated in Fig. 1B. The key step involves a previously reported Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of tertiary allylic sulfone 3ga to afford 4ga, and 4gb efficiently with 62% and 58% of isolated yields respectively. Subsequent deprotection of phenol then could complete the formal synthesis of (AE)-sporochnol and (AE)-bakuchiol (Fig. 1B). 20,21 Starting from 3ga in 2 steps our tertiary allylic sulfones can be used to prepare such natural products and other related compounds bearing all-carbon quaternary centers in a modular way. 22 To gain mechanistic insight and the initial understanding on how the reaction works, we decided to study the reactivity of [Mo 0 L n ] species (Fig. 3). The [Mo(bpy)(CO) 4 ] complex 23 was prepared on a large scale by reacting Mo(CO) 6 and 2,2 0 -bipyridine (L1) in THF at 60 C. 16 As shown in Fig. 3, the structure was conrmed and further analyzed. 24 Interestingly, the [Mo(bpy)(CO) 4 ] complex was found to be catalytically more efficient when used under the standard conditions, supported by the formation of branched allylic sulfone product 3aa in 96% yield. A small decline in yield of 3aa in the [Mo(CO) 6 ]/L1 catalyst system was observed, thus providing evidence that a [Mo(bpy)(CO) 4 ] complex is likely to be the active precatalyst species in this allylic sulfonylation reaction. 25</p>Conclusions<p>In conclusion we have developed a method for the allylic sulfonylation of a,a-disubstituted allylic electrophiles, using inexpensive and commercially available catalyst components (Mo(CO) 6 /2,2 0 -bipyridine). To the best of our knowledge, the presented methodology is the rst example of the use of sodium sulnates as the heteroatom nucleophile reagent with tertiary allylic electrophiles to employ the group 6 catalyst in allylic substitution of tertiary allylic electrophiles to form C-S bonds. The process is characterized by its atom economic procedure, wide substrate scope, and excellent regioselectivity prole even in the context of late-stage functionalization, thus providing ample opportunities for further derivatization through traditional Suzuki cross-coupling reactions (as presented in Fig. 2b). Investigations of enantioselective reactions, the mechanism and extension to other heteroatom nucleophiles are currently ongoing and will be reported in due course.</p>Conflicts of interest<p>The authors declare no conicts of interest.</p>","answer":"The first molybdenum-catalyzed allylic sulfonylation of tertiary allylic electrophiles is described.

This atom economic and operationally simple methodology is characterized by its relatively mild conditions, wide substrate scope, and excellent regioselectivity profile, thus unlocking a new platform to forge sulfone moieties, even in the context of late-stage functionalization and providing ample opportunities for further derivatization through traditional Suzuki cross-coupling reactions."},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

However, knowledge of the cellular mechanisms underlying the effects of insulin on neuronal function is incomplete. Here, we show that cell autonomous insulin signaling within the Drosophila CM9 motor neuron regulates the release of neurotransmitter via alteration of the synaptic vesicle fusion machinery. This effect of insulin utilizes the FOXO-dependent regulation of the thor gene, which encodes the Drosophila homologue of the eif-4e binding protein( 4eBP). A critical target of this regulatory mechanism is Complexin, a synaptic protein known to regulate synaptic vesicle exocytosis. We find that the amounts of Complexin protein observed at the synapse is regulated by insulin and genetic manipulations of Complexin levels support the model that increased synaptic Complexin reduces neurotransmission in response to insulin signaling.Introduction:Metabolic disorders such as diabetes are associated with widespread declines in neuronal function including peripheral and proximal neuropathy, retinopathy, reduced cognition, impaired motor functions and increased risk of developing neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer’s disease( Deak and Sonntag, 2012; Gispen and Biessels, 2000; Luchsinger, 2012; Park, 2001; Plum et al., 2005). The loss of normal synapse function is believed to be an important contributor to all these disorders suggesting that changes in insulin signaling can influence synaptic connectivity throughout the nervous system. For example, analysis of human patients with type II diabetes( T2DM) reveals changes in brain structures, including synapse numbers, which correlate with decreased cognitive performance( Qiu et al., 2014). In addition, numerous rodent studies have demonstrated that changes in peripheral and cerebral insulin result in changes to synapse function and plasticity in both the hippocampus and retinae( Gispen and Biessels, 2000; Hombrebueno et al., 2014). Rodent and human studies have also demonstrated that changes in normal insulin signaling can alter peripheral synapses including neuromuscular junctions( NMJs)( Allen et al., 2015a, 2015b; Fahim et al., 1998; Francis et al., 2011; Garcia et al., 2012; Ramji et al., 2007). Despite the wide-spread effects of altered insulin signaling on synapse function, the cellular mechanisms underlying the effects insulin signaling on synapse function, especially the control of neurotransmitter release, are poorly understood. There exist well-established evolutionarily conserved targets of insulin signaling that have been implicated in the effects of insulin on synapse function( Kleinridders et al., 2014; Park, 2001; Plum et al., 2005). This includes the mammalian target of rapamycin( mTOR) complex that is positively regulated by insulin signaling. In the postsynaptic compartment, TOR signaling has been directly implicated in the regulation of post-synaptic function including the formation of new synapses and the generation of retrograde signaling during homeostatic synaptic plasticity( Penney et al., 2012; Stoica et al., 2011; Takei and Nawa, 2014; Weston et al., 2012). The role of TOR signaling within the presynaptic nerve terminal is less clear. Another important target of insulin signaling is the FOXO family of transcription factors. Insulin negatively regulates FOXO via phosphorylation by Akt in both flies and rodents( Puig et al., 2003; Teleman et al., 2005; Yamamoto and Tatar, 2011). Previous studies have established that FOXO is required in Drosophila larval motor neurons for synapse growth, synaptic vesicle recycling, and for the control of neuronal excitability downstream of PI3K signaling( Howlett et al., 2008; Nechipurenko and Broihier, 2012). In mammals, recent studies have revealed a requirement for FOXO6, a FOXO family member highly expressed in the hippocampus, during learning and memory( Salih et al., 2012). It was shown in these studies that FOXO6 was required for the expression of genes involved in neurotransmission supporting a direct role for FOXO in the regulation of synapse function( Salih et al., 2012). It is unclear whether insulin signaling regulates FOXO activity in neurons in any system. In the present study, we present evidence that in adult Drosophila motor neurons, insulin signaling negatively regulates the presynaptic release of neurotransmitter via the FOXO-dependent regulation of the translational inhibitor the eukaryotic initiation factor 4e binding protein( 4eBP). The translational target of this signaling system appears to be the Complexin protein, which is known to regulate the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles providing direct link between neuronal insulin signaling and neurotransmitter release.Discussion:Here, we have revealed that insulin signaling in adult Drosophila motor neurons can negatively regulate the release of neurotransmitter from the NMJ. This control of neurotransmission by insulin signaling utilizes the FOXO transcription factor to transcriptionally regulate the eukaryotic initiation factor 4e binding protein( 4eBP, also known as Thor in Drosophila), a negative regulator of cap-dependent translation( Gingras et al., 1999). Importantly, our data suggest that the control of neurotransmitter release by insulin signaling is dependent on the diet conditions and likely does not reflect a role for insulin in basal neurotransmitter release. Our data supports the model that repression of FOXO activity due to insulin signaling results in reduced levels of 4eBP mRNA, subsequent increased protein translation, and reduced SV release. The activity of 4eBP is also regulated by phosphorylation via the actions of the target of rapamycin complex( TOR)( Beretta et al., 1996) and numerous studies have implicated the TOR complex in the regulation of synapse function( Costa-Mattioli et al., 2009; Hoeffer and Klann, 2010; Penney et al., 2012; Takei et al., 2004; Weston et al., 2012). The regulation of neurotransmission by diet at the CM9 NMJ appears to be largely independent of TOR since the effect of diet on neurotransmission is not affected by rapamycin, a potent inhibitor of the TOR. Importantly, we observe that our rapamycin treatment condition does result in the predicted change in the phosphorylation state of 4eBP demonstrating that TOR can regulate 4eBP in adult Drosophila motor neurons. Because most of the data on the effects of TOR on synapse function suggest a post-synaptic role for this complex, these data suggest that the regulation of 4eBP within the CM9 motor neuron is compartmentalized with the presynaptic pool regulated specifically by FOXO and the post-synaptic pool regulated by TOR. The localization of the TOR complex in neurons is unknown, but it presumably is localized within the cytoplasm and lysosomes( Betz and Hall, 2013). Whether TOR is excluded from the presynaptic terminal or enriched within the postsynaptic compartment remains to be investigated. There exist three members of the 4eBP family in mammals with 4eBP2 being the most highly expressed family member in the brain( Banko et al., 2005). Analysis of 4eBP2 knock-out mice has revealed that this protein is required for a broad range of cognitive and motor behaviors( Banko et al., 2007; Gkogkas et al., 2013). The changes in behavior observed in 4eBP2 knock-out mice correlate with changes in synapse function that are highlighted by changes in post-synaptic glutamate receptor function( Banko et al., 2005; Bidinosti et al., 2010; Gkogkas et al., 2013; Ran et al., 2013). To date, there is no evidence from these studies of an effect of the 4eBP2 knock-out on presynaptic function. In addition to effects on glutamate receptor function, 4eBP2 has also been implicated in the regulation of neuroligin levels( Gkogkas et al., 2013; Khoutorsky et al., 2015), a post-synaptic scaffolding protein that functions to regulate synaptogenesis and neurotransmission( Craig and Kang, 2007). The regulation of neurotransmission by neuroligin is likely due to its trans-synaptic interaction with the presynaptic binding protein neurexin, a cell adhesion molecule known to regulate synaptic vesicle exocytosis( Südhof, 2008). Thus, changes in post-synaptic neuroligin levels can result in increased presynaptic function, although this would represent a non-autonomous role for 4eBP on neurotransmitter release. It is unclear if altered neuroligin-neurexin signaling contributes to the neurotransmission phenotypes observed in the 4eBP2 knock-out mice. We find that phosphorylation of 4eBP by dTOR has no effect on the regulation of neurotransmitter release by insulin signaling in the CM9 MN. This result suggests that there might exist separate pools of 4eBP within the neuron that specify the effects of TOR versus FOXO on synapse function. Currently, it is unclear how the compartmentalization of 4eBP activity is achieved within the pre- versus postsynaptic compartments. We have found that Staufen binds to 4eBP mRNA in motor neurons and is required for the effects of diet on neurotransmission. In addition to mRNA transport, Staufen is also known to bind nascent mRNAs and mediate their nuclear export( Elvira et al., 2006; Jansen and Niessing, 2012; Liu et al., 2006; Macchi et al., 2004; Miki and Yoneda, 2004; Miki et al., 2005). Perhaps, the association of Staufen with nascent 4eBP mRNAs driven by FOXO differentiates the dendritic from axonal populations of 4eBP. In addition to 4eBP mRNA, we also find that Drosophila Staufen binds strongly to complexin mRNA. This suggested that diet might control neurotransmission via the regulation of Complexin. In support of this model, we find that Complexin levels at the CM9 NMJ is increased in animals raised on a 2X diet compared to a 1X diet and that these levels are sensitive to changes in insulin signaling. This suggests that the increased levels of Complexin in animals raised on the 2X diet inhibit the SV release. We also find that genetically altering complexin levels can influence neurotransmitter release from the CM9 NMJ in a diet-dependent manner similar to what is observed with 4eBP, chico and dFOXO mutants supporting the model that Complexin is an important target for the regulation of neuronal function by insulin signaling. Because both complexin and 4eBP mRNAs are bound to Staufen, perhaps diet controls neurotransmitter release by altering the relative amounts of bound 4eBP to complexin mRNAs. The effects of our diet switch on neurotransmission support that an acute increase in Complexin levels can inhibit neurotransmitter release at the CM9 NMJ. It is clear from knock-out studies in mice, worms and Drosophila larvae that Complexin is required for normal calcium-dependent SV exocytosis and supports a facilitatory, not inhibitory, role for Complexin during neurotransmission( Cho et al., 2010; Jorquera et al., 2012; Radoff et al., 2014; Reim et al., 2001). But other studies, including acute injections and vesicle targeting studies, have indicated that Complexin can also have an inhibitory role on evoked release( Archer et al., 2002; Giraudo et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007; Ono et al., 1998; Tang et al., 2006; Tokumaru et al., 2001). Further, comparison of complexin knock-down to knock-out in different neuronal cell types suggest that the effects of Complexin on SV exocytosis can be sensitive to chronic versus acute manipulations and dependent upon neuronal cell type( Yang et al., 2013). Although we find that diet has no effect on SV release from Drosophila larval NMJs, further studies will be needed to determine if this is due to differences between adult and larval motor neurons or to differences in the manipulations of Complexin. In addition, it is likely that the effects of Complexin that we observe require the co-translation of other exocytotic components. Regardless our data support the model that increases in synaptic Complexin levels resulting from insulin signaling can reduce neurotransmitter release. These results have broad implications for the effects of insulin signaling on the nervous system.","answer":"The rates of obesity and diabetes are increasing worldwide . Both conditions produce a wide range of detrimental effects on health , including an increased risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease . Obesity and diabetes reduce how well many of the body’s cells can respond to a hormone called insulin . Insulin signaling is believed to influence how the brain works , but this had not been studied in detail . Mahoney et al . have now studied the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to investigate whether insulin signaling within neurons can directly alter neurotransmission – the process by which neurons communicate with each other by releasing chemicals called neurotransmitters . The fruit flies were fed a high protein diet , which increased their insulin signaling and reduced the activity of a protein called FOXO in the neurons . This resulted in the reduced transcription of the translational inhibitor 4eBP and ultimately caused an increase in the amount of the Complexin protein . This protein in turn reduced the release of neurotransmitters . Thus , the results of the experiments demonstrate that insulin signaling within adult fruit fly neurons decreases neurotransmission . Future experiments will be needed to study these mechanisms in more detail . One of the remaining open questions is where proteins such as Complexin are being made in the neuron ."},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

This study investigated if one could use a correlation between telomere length and age, to predict the age of an individual from their DNA.Therefore, telomere length measurement by real-time quantitative PCR cannot be used to predict age of a person, due to the presence of large inter-individual variations in telomere lengths.ur results provide the first clear and unambiguous evidence of a relationship between telomere length and mortality in the wild, and substantiate the prediction that telomere length and shortening rate can act as an indicator of biological age further to chronological age when exploring life history questions in natural conditions.","answer":"no"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

However, IFN-γ can also participate in tolerance-induction pathways, indicating it is not solely proinflammatory. This study addresses how IFN-γ can suppress activation of diabetogenic CD8(+) T cells. CD8(+) T cells transgenically expressing the diabetogenic AI4 T-cell receptor adoptively transferred disease to otherwise unmanipulated NOD. IFN-γ (null), but not standard NOD, mice. AI4 T cells only underwent vigorous intrasplenic proliferation in NOD. IFN-γ (null) recipients. Disease -protective IFN-γ could be derived from any lymphocyte source and suppressed diabetogenic CD8(+) T-cell responses both directly and through an intermediary nonlymphoid cell population. Suppression was not dependent on regulatory T cells, but was associated with increased inhibitory STAT1 to STAT4 expression levels in pathogenic AI4 T cells. Importantly, IFN-γ exposure during activation reduced the cytotoxicity of human-origin type 1 diabetes - relevant autoreactive CD8(+) T cells. Collectively, these results indicate that rather than marking the most proinflammatory lymphocytes in diabetes development, IFN-γ production could represent an attempted limitation of pathogenic CD8(+) T-cell activation. Thus, great care should be taken when designing possible diabetic intervention approaches modulating IFN-γ production.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"nonlymphoid\\", \\"Diabetogenic CD8(+) T-Cell Effector\\", \\"lymphocytes\\", \\"CD4(+)\\", \\"cell population\\", \\"CD8(+) T-cell\\", \\"diabetogenic CD8(+) T cells\\", \\"CD8(+) T cells\\", \\"T cells\\", \\"diabetogenic CD8(+) T-cell\\", \\"lymphocyte\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"diabetogenic\\", \\"transgenically expressing\\", \\"diabetic\\", \\"activation\\", \\"Type 1 diabetes\\", \\"type 1 diabetes\\", \\"proliferation\\", \\"Type 1 Diabetes\\", \\"Disease\\", \\"responses\\", \\"tolerance-induction\\", \\"expression\\", \\"disease\\", \\"AI4\\", \\"cytotoxicity\\", \\"NOD mouse model\\", \\"pathways\\", \\"diabetes\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [], \\"BodySubstance\\": [], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"Interferon-u03b3\\", \\"interferon-u03b3\\", \\"STAT1\\", \\"IFN-u03b3\\", \\"T-cell receptor\\", \\"cytokine\\", \\"STAT4\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [\\"NOD, mice\\", \\"NOD\\", \\"unmanipulated NOD\\"], \\"Finding\\": [], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"care\\", \\"intervention\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"approaches\\", \\"modulating\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

Such compartmentalization has been claimed to occur in members of the Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobiae, and Chlamydiae bacterial superphylum. Here we have investigated the three-dimensional organization of the complex endomembrane system in the planctomycete bacteria Gemmata obscuriglobus. We reveal that the G. obscuriglobus cells are neither compartmentalized nor nucleated as none of the spaces created by the membrane invaginations are closed; instead, they are all interconnected. Thus, the membrane organization of G. obscuriglobus, and most likely all PVC members, is not different from, but an extension of, the “classical” Gram-negative bacterial membrane system. Our results have implications for our definition and understanding of bacterial cell organization, the genesis of complex structure, and the origin of the eukaryotic endomembrane system.Introduction:The compartmentalization of cellular space has been an important evolutionary innovation, allowing for the functional specialization of the membrane-bound organelles. This compartmentalization is extensively developed in eukaryotes, and although not as complex and developed, compartments with specialized function are known to occur in bacteria[1]. Some examples include protein-bound organelles, like carboxysomes, which increase the concentration of metabolite in a closed space[2] and gas vesicles, which are gas-filled protein-bound organelles that function to modulate the buoyancy of cells[3]. Other examples include the magnetosomes in magnetotactic bacteria, which are invaginations of the cytoplasmic membrane that enclose a magnetic mineral without achieving separation into individual vesicles[4]. Individual magnetosomes are arranged into one or more chains within the cell, where they act to orient the cell within a magnetic field. Photosynthetic prokaryotes including the purple bacteria, the cyanobacteria, and the green bacteria have photosynthetic membranes extending from their inner membrane( IM), also called cytoplasmic membrane, maximizing the size of the membrane surface exposed to light. These membranes can adopt diverse shapes, including the formation of membrane stacks continuous with the cell membrane, spherical invaginations of the inner membrane so that multiple membrane spheres are connected to one another or are folded in an accordion-like structure and adjacent to the cell membrane[5]. Lastly, the anammoxosome is a membrane-bound compartment found in the anammox bacteria, which are divergent planctomycetes. It houses the anaerobic ammonium oxidation reaction. Its membrane is enriched in unusual concatenated lipids, the ladderane lipids, which form an impermeable barrier preventing the diffusion of the toxic intermediates produced during the anammox reaction[6]. Bacterial cell organization can be surprisingly complex. Nevertheless, members of the Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobiae, and Chlamydiae( PVC) bacterial superphylum are exceptional in displaying diverse and extensive intracellular membranous organization. For this reason they have been labeled the “compartmentalized bacteria”[7],[8]. The planctomycete Gemmata obscuriglobus is particularly interesting because a double membrane, formed from a folded single membrane, has been suggested to surround its genetic material. This double membrane is reminiscent of the eukaryotic nuclear envelope, leading to the name “nucleated bacterium”[7],[9]. Early ultrastructural analysis based on thin sections of cryo-substituted cells, freeze-fracture replicas, and computer-aided 3-D reconstructions has been used to argue that the DNA in G. obscuriglobus is enclosed within a compartment separated from the rest of the cytoplasm[8],[10]. However, the data are not entirely convincing. A three-dimensional( 3D) reconstruction from serial sections and fluorescence microscopy of living cells was presented to support the claim of “the continuous nature of the membranous envelope surrounding the nuclear body and completely enclosing the nucleoid, apart from where gaps appear in the envelope”[8]. As stated by the authors, the “outer region of the nuclear body has a similar appearance to the cytoplasm, ” and ribosomes are located in the same compartment as the DNA, arguing against the specific nature of this compartment. In addition, ribosomes line the walls of the internal membrane of the “nuclear compartment”[8], as observed along the inner membrane( IM) of classical bacteria. This and other analyses have led to the suggestion that the PVC cell plan is different from “classical” Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, because of the absence of a typical outer membrane( OM)[7],[8]. The outermost membrane closely juxtaposed to the cell wall was interpreted as the cytoplasmic membrane, while the remaining membrane was called the intracytoplasmic membrane( ICM), mainly based on the distinctive organization of the ICM supposedly surrounding the DNA. The claimed absence of an OM implied the absence of a periplasm, the volume located between IM and OM in Gram-negative bacteria. More recent evidence based on genomic information argue against this conclusion, including the presence of genes associated with the OM and the periplasm in Gram-negative bacteria[11],[12], and the presence of remnants of the division cluster and the peptidoglycan synthesis pathway( typically anchored in the OM)[13]. A more recent analysis of vitrified sections by cryo-electron tomography implied that the “internal membrane” system might be continuous with the ICM, but formed by membrane invaginations and that “the bacterial nucleoid is not completely sealed by the double-membrane system”[14]. It was observed that “the double-membrane network of G. obscuriglobus cells emanates from the intracytoplasmic membrane to form unsealed compartments. ” In that study, the bacteria were preserved close to native state, sectioned, and imaged under cryogenic conditions to reduce preparation-induced artifacts. However, because of the difficulties involved in sectioning cells under liquid nitrogen temperatures and the technical challenges presented by the use of vitrified sections in obtaining serial sections of a whole cell, the analysis was based on tomographic reconstruction of only a fraction, up to 150 nm thick sections, of G. obscuriglobus cells, which are usually ∼2 µm in diameter. We have recently contributed to this series of analyses and have described the cell organization in two types of G. obscuriglobus cells[15]. In the first type, the dividing form, the inner membrane protrudes deeply into the cytoplasm to form thin membrane sheet invaginations extending towards the inside of the cell. The second cell type is not budding, and has increased periplasmic volume populated by vesicle-like structures. Till present, how the membranes are organized in 3D is not known for any of the PVC bacteria. We have thus investigated the 3D membrane organization in multiple cells of the species G. obscuriglobus. In order to capture the membrane organization of entire cells, we chose to use plastic embedding for this study. Here we present the reconstructed volume of one complete cell of the first, dividing type, where we followed the entire organization of internal membranes within the cell. We report for the first time the 3D reconstruction of a bacterium with a complex endomembrane system. Our 3D reconstruction reveals that G. obscuriglobus cells are neither compartmentalized nor nucleated. We show that the spaces created by the membrane invaginations are all interconnected and not closed. The organization of cellular space is similar to that of a classical Gram-negative bacterium modified by the presence of large invaginations of the IM inside the cytoplasm.Discussion:Eukaryogenesis has long been a question of major interest to biologists. Although it is increasingly accepted that eukaryotes and archaea share a common ancestor, the nature of this ancestor( if it was already an archaea per se or an intermediate organism) is still debated[30]. The eukaryotic cell is differentiated from bacterial and archaeal cells by many features whose origins are for the most part still unknown. These features include the actin- and tubulin-based cytoskeleton, the mitochondria, the nuclear pore, the spliceosome, the proteasome, and the ubiquitin signaling system[31]. Features reminiscent of these are increasingly detected in prokaryotes, including the members of the PVC bacterial superphylum[23],[32]. Because PVCs display some features related to eukaryotes or archaea, including sterol production[26] and ether-linked lipids[6], it has been proposed that the PVC ancestor might have shared a sisterhood relationship with the ancestor of the eukaryotes and archaea[23],[32]. Other scenarios involving a relationship between PVC and eukaryotes have also been proposed[21],[33]. However, whether the PVC features are homologous or analogous to their eukaryotic or archaeal counterparts is still under discussion[34]. If there is no evolutionary relationship between PVC and eukaryotes, the complex endomembrane system of those bacteria highlights that endomembrane systems have evolved more than once. The complex endomembrane system of G. obscuriglobus is in direct contact with proteins displaying structural similarities to eukaryotic membrane coat proteins like clathrin or sec31 that sustain the eukaryotic endomembrane system[15],[35]. In addition, G. obscuriglobus endomembranes are involved in the otherwise strictly eukaryotic process of endocytosis[36]. These data reinforce the possibility of an evolutionary relationship between the eukaryotic and PVC endomembrane systems and suggest that the latter could represent intermediary steps in the development of the former from a “classical” Gram-negative bacterium[23],. Deeper characterization of the PVC endomembrane system is therefore of great interest. In conclusion, our analysis reveals that the membrane organization in G. obscuriglobus is not fundamentally different from that of “classical” bacteria, but a complex variant of it. The next step is to link those observations with the development of this endomembrane system in cells using live imaging methods.","answer":"The compartmentalization of cellular space has been an important evolutionary innovation , allowing for the functional specialization of cellular space .

In order to examine the site of action of an NR2B subtype-selective NMDA antagonist CP-101,606, we investigated its analgesic effect in a rat model of neuropathic pain at various routes of administration. Mechanical allodynia was induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Subcutaneous treatment of the animals with CP-101,606 at 10 mg/kg significantly inhibited CCI-induced mechanical allodynia. Intracerebroventricular injection of CP-101,606 at 10, 30 and 100 nmol also inhibited the mechanical allodynia in a dose-dependent manner, the statistically significant effect being achieved at the highest dose tested (100 nmol) without producing any behavioral abnormalities. However, intrathecal injection of CP-101,606 at a dose of 300 nmol failed to inhibit CCI-induced allodynia. A receptor binding assay using rat forebrain and spinal cord membrane preparations demonstrated that [3H]CP-101,606 bound to the brain NR2B receptor with a greater extent compared to the spinal cord one. These findings suggest that the anti-allodynia effect of CP-101,606 is ascribable to blockade of NR2B receptors at the brain, but not at the spinal cord. In contrast, intrathecal injection of a non-selective NMDA antagonist, memantine, significantly inhibited CCI-induced mechanical allodynia at a dose of 300 nmol, indicating the difference in the site of action between the non-selective NMDA antagonist and the NR2B-specific NMDA antagonist.","answer":"[[\\"memantine\\", \\"ANTAGONIST\\", \\"NMDA\\"], [\\"CP-101,606\\", \\"ANTAGONIST\\", \\"NR2B\\"], [\\"CP-101,606\\", \\"ANTAGONIST\\", \\"NMDA\\"], [\\"CP-101,606\\", \\"INHIBITOR\\", \\"NR2B\\"], [\\"[3H]CP-101,606\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"NR2B\\"]]"},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

One of the main theories concerning the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs (ADs) is based on the notion that the neurochemical background of depression involves an impairment of central noradrenergic transmission with a concomitant decrease of the norepinephrine (NE) in the synaptic gap. Many ADs increase synaptic NE availability by inhibition of the reuptake of NE. Using mice lacking NE transporter (NET-/-) we examined their baseline phenotype as well as the response in the forced swim test (FST) and in the tail suspension test (TST) upon treatment with ADs that display different pharmacological profiles. In both tests, the NET-/- mice behaved like wild-type (WT) mice acutely treated with ADs. Autoradiographic studies showed decreased binding of the beta-adrenergic ligand [3H]CGP12177 in the cerebral cortex of NET-/- mice, indicating the changes at the level of beta-adrenergic receptors similar to those obtained with ADs treatment. The binding of [3H]prazosin to alpha1-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex of NET-/- mice was also decreased, most probably as an adaptive response to the sustained elevation of extracellular NE levels observed in these mice. A pronounced NET knockout-induced shortening of the immobility time in the TST (by ca 50%) compared to WT mice was not reduced any further by NET-inhibiting ADs such as reboxetine, desipramine, and imipramine. Citalopram, which is devoid of affinity for the NET, exerted a significant reduction of immobility time in the NET-/- mice. In the FST, reboxetine, desipramine, imipramine, and citalopram administered acutely did not reduce any further the immobility time shortened by NET knockout itself (ca 25%); however, antidepressant-like action of repeatedly (7 days) administered desipramine was observed in NET-/- mice, indicating that the chronic presence of this drug may also affect other neurochemical targets involved in the behavioral reactions monitored by this test. From the present study, it may be concluded that mice lacking the NET may represent a good model of some aspects of depression-resistant behavior, paralleled with alterations in the expression of adrenergic receptors, which result as an adaptation to elevated levels of extracellular NE.","answer":"[[\\"[3H]CGP12177\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"beta-adrenergic receptors\\"], [\\"[3H]prazosin\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"alpha1-adrenergic receptors\\"], [\\"NE\\", \\"INDIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"adrenergic receptors\\"], [\\"Citalopram\\", \\"NOT\\", \\"NET\\"]]"},{"question":"Given an abstract from a research paper, your task is to identify and label relationships between chemical compounds and genes mentioned in the abstract.The relationship type must be one of ['DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE', 'INDIRECT-REGULATOR', 'PART-OF', 'MODULATOR-ACTIVATOR', 'REGULATOR', 'INHIBITOR', 'COFACTOR', 'UPREGULATOR', 'ACTIVATOR', 'ANTAGONIST', 'NOT', 'INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR', 'SUBSTRATE_PRODUCT-OF', 'INDIRECT-UPREGULATOR', 'AGONIST', 'PRODUCT-OF', 'MODULATOR', 'DIRECT-REGULATOR', 'UNDEFINED', 'AGONIST-INHIBITOR', 'AGONIST-ACTIVATOR', 'MODULATOR-INHIBITOR'].Please format your output as a JSON array.

The aggregation and interfacial behavior of mixtures of anionic (sodium dodecylsulfate, SDS) and cationic (dodecylammonium bromide, DTAB) surfactants were investigated. A room-temperature ionic liquid (IL) was explored as a solvent for the SDS/DTAB system and compared to water. The critical micelle concentration (cmc) and composition in mixed micelles were determined for both solvents. Our experiments showed nearly ideal mixing of SDS/DTAB over the entire composition range and suggest that charge screening is prominent in ILs. This behavior is in sharp contrast to the strong electrostatic attraction and a multiphase composition gap in water. Two models by Clint and Rubingh, which describe ideal and nonideal micellar behavior, respectively, are discussed on the basis of our results. According to Rubingh 's model, the composition of mixed micelles is gradually changing with the bulk composition in ILs but tends to be a 1:1 ratio in water. The results here are further support of the strong charge screening in ionic liquids.","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

Here, we develop Perturb-seq, combining single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based perturbations to perform many such assays in a pool. We demonstrate Perturb-seq by analyzing 200,000 cells in immune cells and cell lines, focusing on transcription factors regulating the response of dendritic cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Perturb-seq accurately identifies individual gene targets, gene signatures, and cell states affected by individual perturbations and their genetic interactions.

First steps towards validation. Despite more than a decade of research in the field of endocrine active compounds targeting the androgen receptor (AR), and although suitable cell lines can be obtained, no validated human stably transfected androgen sensitive transactivation assay is available. Bayer Schering Pharma (BSP) and the Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO), partners within the EU-sponsored 6th framework project ReProTect, made first steps towards such a validation. A standard operation protocol (SOP) developed at BSP based on the androgen sensitive PALM cell line was transferred to VITO and its performance and transferability were thoroughly studied. The investigation followed a generic protocol prepared for all reporter gene assays evaluated within ReProTect, and in both laboratories at least three independent experiments were performed. The highest concentration to be tested was limited to 10 microM, if needed. A few compounds, 17alpha-methyltestosterone (17alpha-MT), vinclozolin and linuron, were studied using a real world scenario, i.e., assuming that their interaction with the AR was not known: A prescreening for agonism and true, competitive antagonism was used to select conditions such as the appropriate mode of action, and the working range excluding cytotoxicity for the final screening. All other compounds were tested according to the generic protocol: Compounds screened for agonism were the reference androgen 17alpha-methyldihydrotestosterone (MDHT), levonorgestrel, norethynodrel, progesterone, o, p'-DDT, and dibutylphthalate (DBP), while compounds screened for antagonism were the reference anti-androgen flutamide, prochloraz, o, p'-DDT, progesterone, norethynodrel, and DBP. Cytotoxicity was assessed in parallel as lactate dehydrogenase release. The prescreen classified 17alpha-MT as androgenic, vinclozolin and linuron as anti-androgenic and compounds were tested accordingly. In the absence of cytotoxicity, appropriate androgenic properties of reference and test compounds were detected by both laboratories, o, p'-DDT and DBP had no androgenic activity. Across the two laboratories EC (50) -values for MDHT, 17alpha-MT, and levonorgestrel varied by not more than a factor of 3.4, for norethynodrel by a factor of 9.7. Progesterone effects could not fully be evaluated, as frequently concentration response curves were incomplete. In the absence of cytotoxicity anti-androgenic properties of reference and test compounds were also detected in both laboratories. DBP, the putative negative reference compound, was inactive, norethynodrel rather showed agonistic properties. Progesterone was an antagonist at low concentrations, but agonistic properties were observed in one laboratory at high concentrations. Since the highest test concentration was limited to 10 microM, for some compounds no complete concentration response curves were obtained and estimation of EC (50) -values was less robust. Our data demonstrated that the SOP was transferable, and that the assay was able to rank compounds with strong, weak, and without affinity for the AR and to discriminate agonists and antagonists. The sensitivity of the assay could be improved further, if the limit of solubility or beginning cytotoxicity was chosen as the highest test concentration. The assay avoids the use of tissues from laboratory animals, and thus contributes to the 3R concept. Furthermore, it could be adjusted to an intermediate/high throughput format. On the whole, this PALM assay is a promising candidate for further validation.","answer":"[[\\"linuron\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"AR\\"], [\\"17alpha-methyltestosterone\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"AR\\"], [\\"17alpha-MT\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"AR\\"], [\\"vinclozolin\\", \\"DIRECT-REGULATOR\\", \\"AR\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a key anabolic enzyme for de novo fatty acid synthesis, which is important in the development of colon carcinoma. The high expression of FASN is considered a promising molecular target for colon cancer therapy. Emodin, a naturally occurring anthraquinone, exhibits an anticancer effect in various types of human cancer, including colon cancer; however, the molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Cell viability was evaluated using a Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay. The apoptosis rate of cells was quantified via flow cytometry following Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. FASN activity was measured by monitoring oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate at a wavelength of 340 nm, and intracellular free fatty acid levels were detected using a Free Fatty Acid Quantification kit. Western blot analysis and reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction were used to detect target gene and protein expression. The present study was performed to investigate whether the gene expression of FASN and its enzymatic activity are regulated by emodin in a human colon cancer cell line. Emodin markedly inhibited the proliferation of HCT116 cells and a higher protein level of FASN was expressed, compared with that in SW480, SNU-C2A or SNU‑C5 cells. Emodin significantly downregulated the protein expression of FASN in HCT116 cells, which was caused by protein degradation due to elevated protein ubiquitination. Emodin also inhibited intracellular FASN enzymatic activity and reduced the levels of intracellular free fatty acids. Emodin enhanced antiproliferation and apoptosis in a dose‑ and time‑dependent manner. The combined treatment of emodin and cerulenin, a commercial FASN inhibitor, had an additive effect on these activities. Palmitate, the final product of the FASN reaction, rescued emodin‑induced viability and apoptosis. In addition, emodin altered FASN‑involved signaling pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and mitogen‑activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2. These results suggested that emodin-regulated cell growth and apoptosis were mediated by inhibiting FASN and provide a molecular basis for colon cancer therapy.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"mitogenu2011activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinasesu00a01/2\\", \\"extracellular signal-regulated kinasesu00a01/2\\", \\"FASN\\", \\"Akt\\", \\"fatty acid synthase\\", \\"Fatty acid synthase\\", \\"mitogenu2011activated protein kinases\\", \\"phosphatidylinositolu00a03-kinase\\", \\"Annexinu00a0V\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The Escherichia coli AlkB protein is involved in protecting cells against mutation and cell death induced specifically by SN2-type alkylating agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). A human cDNA encoding a polypeptide homologous to E.coli AlkB was discovered by searching a database of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) derived from high throughput cDNA sequencing. The full-length human AlkB homolog (hABH) cDNA clone contains a 924 bp open reading frame encoding a 34 kDa protein which is 52% similar and 23% identical to E.coli AlkB. The hABH gene, which maps to chromosome 14q24, was ubiquitously expressed in 16 human tissues examined. When hABH was expressed in E.coli alkB mutant cells partial rescue of the cells from MMS-induced cell death occurred. Under the conditions used expression of hABH in skin fibroblasts was not regulated by treatment with MMS. Our findings show that the AlkB protein is structurally and functionally conserved from bacteria to human, but its regulation may have diverged during evolution.","answer":"{\\"Gene\\": [\\"AlkB\\", \\"alkB\\", \\"hABH\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

We evaluate multiple predictive models used to infer the dynamics of scooping and dumping actions. These models are evaluated on a task that involves manipulating the media in order to deform it into a desired shape. Our best performing model is based on a highly-tailored convolutional network architecture with domain-specific optimizations, which we show accurately models the physical interaction of the robotic scoop with the underlying media. We empirically demonstrate that explicitly predicting physical mechanics results in a policy that out-performs both a hand-crafted dynamics baseline, and a \\"value-network\\", which must otherwise implicitly predict the same mechanics in order to produce accurate value estimates.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: [2]: We introduce SE3-Nets, which are deep networks designed to model rigid body motion from raw point cloud data. Based only on pairs of depth images along with an action vector and point wise data associations, SE3-Nets learn to segment effected object parts and predict their motion resulting from the applied force. Rather than learning point wise flow vectors, SE3-Nets predict SE3 transformations for different parts of the scene. Using simulated depth data of a table top scene and a robot manipulator, we show that the structure underlying SE3-Nets enables them to generate a far more consistent prediction of object motion than traditional flow based networks.[3]: Wooden blocks are a common toy for infants, allowing them to develop motor skills and gain intuition about the physical behavior of the world. In this paper, we explore the ability of deep feed-forward models to learn such intuitive physics. Using a 3D game engine, we create small towers of wooden blocks whose stability is randomized and render them collapsing (or remaining upright). This data allows us to train large convolutional network models which can accurately predict the outcome, as well as estimating the block trajectories. The models are also able to generalize in two important ways: (i) to new physical scenarios, e.g. towers with an additional block and (ii) to images of real wooden blocks, where it obtains a performance comparable to human subjects.[4]: Recent advances in AI and robotics have claimed many incredible results with deep learning, yet no work to date has applied deep learning to the problem of liquid perception and reasoning. In this paper, we apply fully-convolutional deep neural networks to the tasks of detecting and tracking liquids. We evaluate three models: a single-frame network, multi-frame network, and a LSTM recurrent network. Our results show that the best liquid detection results are achieved when aggregating data over multiple frames and that the LSTM network outperforms the other two in both tasks. This suggests that LSTM-based neural networks have the potential to be a key component for enabling robots to handle liquids using robust, closed-loop controllers.[5]: [6]: Pouring a specific amount of liquid is a challenging task. In this paper we develop methods for robots to use visual feedback to perform closed-loop control for pouring liquids. We propose both a model-based and a model-free method utilizing deep learning for estimating the volume of liquid in a container. Our results show that the model-free method is better able to estimate the volume. We combine this with a simple PID controller to pour specific amounts of liquid, and show that the robot is able to achieve an average 38ml deviation from the target amount. To our knowledge, this is the first use of raw visual feedback to pour liquids in robotics.[7]: We present the Neural Physics Engine (NPE), a framework for learning simulators of intuitive physics that naturally generalize across variable object count and different scene configurations. We propose a factorization of a physical scene into composable object-based representations and a neural network architecture whose compositional structure factorizes object dynamics into pairwise interactions. Like a symbolic physics engine, the NPE is endowed with generic notions of objects and their interactions; realized as a neural network, it can be trained via stochastic gradient descent to adapt to specific object properties and dynamics of different worlds. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach on simple rigid body dynamics in two-dimensional worlds. By comparing to less structured architectures, we show that the NPE's compositional representation of the structure in physical interactions improves its ability to predict movement, generalize across variable object count and different scene configurations, and infer latent properties of objects such as mass.","answer":"Similar to this work, ConvNets have recently been utilized for learning intuition of physical interactions by mimicking physics simulators [3] [7] , for detecting and pouring liquids [4] [6] , and for explicit modeling of rigid body dynamics [2] [1] or fluid dynamics [5] .

The preparation of fluorescent supramolecular polymers with desired properties is challenging due to the potential incompatibilities and interferences by the incorporation of fluorophores with the self-assembly process.</p><p>Over the last decades, investigation in discrete supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) has gained attention due to their well-defined sizes and shapes,9 and diverse functionalities (photophysical, biological, and catalytic properties).10 SCCs can exhibit superior properties comparing to the independent building blocks due to the interactions between the building blocks and the unique cyclic topologies, affording a simple and efficient methodology for the bottom-up preparation of functional material at the molecular level. Therefore, supramolecular polymers with novel topological structures as well as photophysical properties can be prepared by the incorporation of SCCs.11 In our previous work, Pt(II) rhomboidal metallacycles with 21-crown-7 moieties and different emission colors were synthesized.12 Cross-linking the metallacycles by the addition of bis-ammonium salts furnishes fluorescent supramolecular polymers, which emission can be tuned by varying the concentration of the light-emitting building blocks.</p><p>Herein, in further pursuit of metallacycle-cored fluorescent supramolecular polymers that possess targeted optical properties, we designed and synthesized a suite of metallacycles 3a-3h comprised of phenanthrene-21-crown-7 (P21C7)-based 60° diplatinum (II) acceptors and 120° dipyridyl donors. Fluorescence emission spanning the visible region (λmax = 427–593 nm) was achieved by functional group modifications on the donor. Fluorescent supramolecular polymers were prepared using P21C7-based host-guest interaction, which display similar emission bands, but higher quantum yields relative to their discrete counterparts in both solution and thin film. A white-light emitting LED was fabricated by placing a yellow-emitting supramolecular polymer SP-3h on a UV-emitting LED, indicating the potential of the supramolecular polymers for applications as photo-electronic materials.</p><p>As shown in Scheme 1, coordination-driven self-assembly of 120° dipyridyl donors 1a-1h with phenanthrene-21-crown-7 (P21C7)-based 60° diplatinum (II) acceptor 2 results in the formation of metallacycles 3a-3h in high yield (>90%) (Figure S1- S42). The resulting metallacycles were characterized by multinuclear NMR and electrospray ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF-MS). Downfield shifts for the pyridyl protons are observed for the metallacycles relative to the free donors, suggesting loss of electron densities upon the formation of platinum-N coordination interaction (Figure S43) in the 1H NMR. For example, comparing the 1H NMR spectra of 1c and 3c reveal that the α-pyridyl proton Hα (8.62 ppm) splits into Hα' and Hα' (8.88 and 8.64 ppm), and the β-pyridyl proton Hβ (7.61 ppm) splits into Hβ' and Hβ'' (8.10 and 7.73 ppm) (Figure 1a) for 3c. The correlation of α, β-pyridyl protons of 3c was indicated by 1H-1H homonuclear correlation spectroscopy NMR (COSY) experiments (Figure S44). In the 31P NMR, a sharp singlet with concomitant 195Pt satellites is observed for each of the metallacycles (Figure 1c), indicating a single phosphorous environment due to the highly symmetric topologies of the metallacycles. The formation of the metallacycles was further confirmed by ESI-TOF-MS. For example, isotopically resolved peaks correspond to intact entities with charge states arising from the loss of the triflate counterions [M-3OTf]3+ with m/z = 1124.65 for 3c (Figure 1d). The experimental results are in good agreement with the calculated values.</p><p>The absorption and emission spectra of the metallacycles are shown in Figures S46, and their optical data are summarized in Table S2. Compared with their corresponding donors 1a-1h (Figure S45, Table S1), all metallacycles 3a-3h show a redshift in the absorption and emission spectra. By the variation of the substituents installed in the pyridyl ligands, the fluorescent emission for the metallacycles ranges from 427 nm to 593 nm, spanning the visible light region. Additionally, the metallacycles with an endohedral amino group, or substituents (COOCH3, CH3, 4-methyl benzene) para to the aniline group exhibit higher quantum yields in solution and thin film. The favorable photophysical properties of these metallacycles make them ideal for the construction of tunable fluorescent supramolecular polymers in a wide range from blue to red by changing substituents on the dipyridyl donors of the SCC.</p><p>Utilizing the guest binding feature of the P21C7 moieties within the metallacycles, cavity-cored supramolecular polymers were prepared by the addition of bis-ammonium salt 6 into the solution of the metallacycles in a 1:1 molar ratio (Scheme 1).</p><p>Concentration-dependent 1H NMR spectroscopy and two-dimensional diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) experiments were performed to provide evidence for the polymerization of the metallacycles. With an increase in the concentration of the metallacycles and 6, the protons of H1 and H2 on the P21C7 moiety gradually shift downfield from 4.45 to 4.47 ppm, and 4.04 to 4.06 ppm, respectively (Figure 2a-2c). In contrast, the protons of H3 and H4 that correspond to the linker 6 exhibit an upfield shift. All of these chemical shifts provide evidence for the presence of the host-guest interaction between the P21C7 moiety and 6.12 Furthermore, all peaks corresponding to the protons on the metallacycles and 6 become broader as the concentration of the metallacycles and 6 increased from 2 mM to 100 mM, indicating the formation of a supramolecular polymer (Figure S47).7c DOSY NMR experiments were used to estimate the size of the supramolecular polymers (Figure 2d). The measured average diffusion coefficient (D) is 4.5 × 10−9 m2 s−1 at 2 mM. When the concentration is increased to 100 mM, D decreased by nearly ten-fold to 5.5 × 10−10 m2 s−1, indicating the formation of polymeric clusters with increasingly larger size. The phenomenon that D decreases with the increasing degree of polymerization is a distinctive feature of supramolecular polymer systems.6c</p><p>The metallacycle-cored supramolecular polymers display similar emission spectra and higher quantum yields in solution compared to the corresponding monomers. The emission spectra of the supramolecular polymers SP-3c (constructed from 3c and 6) and SP-3h (constructed from 3h and 6) are shown in Figure 3. The solution of 3c (c = 40 mM) displays an emission band centered at 515 nm (Φ3c = 0.15) (Figure 3a), while the emission band red-shifts to 530 nm and the quantum yield increases to 0.18 for SP-3c at the same concentration. A similar phenomenon was found in the emission profiles of 3h and SP-3h, exhibiting a red-shift of 15 nm (from 555 nm to 570 nm) and an enhancement of 0.02 (Φsp-3h=26) in the quantum yield (Figure 3c).</p><p>The emission of the supramolecular polymer thin film, on the other hand, exhibits a blue-shift of 10 nm compared to that in solution (Figures 3b, 3d and Table S3). The quantum yields of the supramolecular polymer thin films are almost double relative to that of their monomer metallacycles (ΦSP-3c-film: Φ3c-film = 13: 6, ΦSP-3h-film: Φ3h-film = 22: 15). To explore the reason for the increase in the quantum yields of the metallacycle-cored supramolecular polymer thin films, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to investigate the microstructure of metallacycle 3c, 3h and their supramolecular polymers SP-3c and SP-3h. The formation of polymeric structure is known for enhancing the fluorescence efficiency of luminophores in the solid state by reducing the self- quenching and aggregation.13 As shown in Figure S48, a structure with tight stacking can be seen in 3c and 3h, while the arrangement of SP-3c and SP-3h appears less dense and more orderly, indicating that the tightly packed structure of the SCCs in the solid state may facilitate the excited state interactions (e. g. formation of non-emissive excimers) that results in loss of excitation energy and a sharp decrease in quantum yield.14 When a linear dynamic polymer is used to modulate the packing of the SCCs, the tight stacking is weakened, and hence the quenching is reduced, resulting in an enhancement of emission efficiency.</p><p>Because of good solubility as well as a high quantum yield, SP-3h was utilized as a coating material to extend the emission range of a narrow band light emitting diode (LED) and thereby convert it to a broadband light source. Commercially available UV-LED was used as a photon source and was converted to a white-light source by dipping it in the solution of SP-3h. As shown in Figure 4, the original UV-LED displays an emission band centered at 430 nm (CIE chromaticity coordinate: 0.16, 0.05), while the SP-3h thin film emission is centered at 560 nm (CIE chromaticity coordinate: 0.38, 0.52). After painting SP-3h on the UV-LED, two bands centered at 430 and 550 nm were observed, extending the emission color from blue to white (Figure 4c-4f). The emission spectra were converted into the CIE chromaticity diagram. The painted LED was found located at (0.29, 0.34), which belongs to the white-light zone (Figure 4b).</p><p>In conclusion, fluorescent supramolecular polymers were constructed by linking P21C7-containing metallacycles using bis-ammonium salt in a 1:1 molar ratio, forming dynamic bonds via host-guest interactions. The supramolecular polymers inherit the tunable fluorescence of the metallacycles by modification on the precursor. Higher emission efficiency is observed upon polymerization in both solution and thin film. SEM studies on the microstructures indicate that the improvement in the quantum yields for the supramolecular polymers is likely the result of alternative stacking patterns of the metallacycles that reduced the loss of the excitation energy. SP-3h was used to coat a blue-light LED source, which converted it into a white-light lamp, showing the potential of the supramolecular polymers for the fabrication of light-emitting materials. This study provides a strategy for the fabrication of fluorescent supramolecular polymers with facile tunability by functional group modifications on the precursors, and lays a foundation for the development of self-assembled polymeric materials for photoelectric, bio-imaging and biosensing applications.</p>","answer":"Herein, we present a method for the preparation of supramolecular polymers with tunable fluorescence via the combination of metal-ligand coordination and phenanthrene-21-crown-7(P21C7)- based host-guest interaction. A suite of rhomboidal metallacycles with different substituents were prepared via the coordination-driven self-assembly of a P21C7- based 60xc2xb0 diplatinum (II) acceptor and 120xc2xb0 dipyridyl donors. By the variation of the substituents on the dipyridyl donors, the metallacycles exhibit emission wavelengths spanning the visible region (xcexbbmax = 427xe2x80x93593 nm). Metallacycle-cored supramolecular polymers were obtained via host-guest interactions between bisammonium salts and P21C7. The supramolecular polymers exhibit similar emission wavelengths of the individual metallacycles and higher fluorescent efficiency in solution and thin films. Utilizing a yellow-emitting supramolecular polymer thin film with high quantum yield (0.22), a white-light-emitting LED was fabricated by painting the thin film onto an ultra violet-LED.

normal , exponential or levy way @xcite in the middle income range .for instance , there are data from japan and usa that are fitted by a log - normal distribution in middle range plus a power law for high income one @xcite , data from united kingdom income and wealth fitted by an exponential law ( middle range ) and a power law ( high range ) @xcite and data from brazil @xcite worker s income and enterprise capital that are fitted by a log - normal plus a power law for high range of income @xcite .    one of the goals of the study of wealth distribution is to determine the social inequalities implied in a given model of economic exchanges .many ways to quantitatively measure the fairness of a given income distribution have been proposed in the economic science . among them , the gini index is well known and frequently used . in brief , for any given wealth density function @xmath4 , with mean @xmath5 and a given number @xmath6  ] , @xmath7 represents the cumulative fraction of population with wealth bellow @xmath8 and lorenz function @xmath9 is defined as the fraction of the total wealth which is attributed to the poorest @xmath10 percentage of the society . it easy to show that @xmath11 .gini index can be then defined as @xmath12 @xcite .it assumes values between 0 percent ( perfect equality ) and 100 percent ( perfect inequality ) .recently we developed a simple parameter free model for the competition among different economic agents within a conservative model .results for the wealth distribution has been published @xcite and also considering the effect of a small world network @xcite . within this modelwe obtained an exponential gibbs - style distribution for the wealth , with a finite lower threshold or poverty line , that is characteristic of models with extremal dynamics . in spite of the fact that this kind of distribution seems to be at stake when compared with pareto law , the idea of a society that take measures in order to improve the situation of the most impoverished is compatible with the propositions of john rawls , in his book \`\` a theory of justice '' @xcite , directed towards an inventive way of securing equality of opportunity as one of the basic principles of justice .he asserts that _ no redistribution of resources within ... a state can occur unless it benefits the least well - off _ and this should be the only way to prevent the stronger ( or richer ) from overpowering the weaker ( or poorer ) .it seems that a minimum dynamics , as that proposed in the bak - sneppen model @xcite , when applied to economics , is a way to ensure to the poorest agent a chance to improve its situation .    in the next sectionwe resume the principal assumptions of the model and the principal results of the numerical simulations .the calculation of the gini index and the comparison with wealth distribution of several countries will be presented in section [ ineq ] along with the conclusionsthe conservative exchange market model ( cemm ) @xcite is a simple macroeconomic model that consists of an one - dimensional lattice with @xmath13 sites and periodic boundary conditions , where every site represents an economic agent ( individuals , industries or countries ) . to each agentit is assigned some wealth - parameter that represents its welfare , like the gni for countries or salary for individuals .we choose an initial configuration where the wealth is a number between 0 and 1 distributed randomly among agents .the dynamics of the system is supported on the idea that some measure should be taken to modify the situation of the poorest agent . in this context, we model this process by a minimum dynamics @xcite : at each time step , the poorest agent , i.e. , the one with the minimum wealth , will take some action , trying to improve its economic state .since the outcome of any such measure is uncertain , the minimum suffers a random change in its wealth @xcite .we assume that whatever wealth is gained ( or lost ) by the poorest agent it will be at the expense of its neighbors and we assume that it is equally debited ( or credited ) between its two nearest neighbors on the lattice , making the total wealth constant .so , the cemm dynamic can be reduced as follows :    * find out the site with minimum wealth @xmath14 ; * substitute @xmath15 to @xmath16 , a new random number between 0 and 1 extracted from an uniform distribution ; * make the difference , @xmath17 * updating the neighbors : + @xmath18 + @xmath19 + note that if @xmath20 is positive ( negative ) the wealth of the neighbors will be reduced ( increased ) by @xmath21 .     for the model with interactions to nearest neighbors ( upper curves ) and with global interactions ( lower curves ) .in both cases we have superposed scaled data corresponding to _ _ _ _ @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .the histograms were built using @xmath25 consecutive states , after a transient of @xmath26 steps has elapsed . ]    numerical simulations on this model showed that , after a relatively long transient , the system arrives at a self organized critical ( soc ) state with a stationary wealth distribution ( figure [ distrisal]@xcite ) in which almost all agents are beyond a certain threshold . on fig[distrisal ] we represent both the cases of local exchanges and of global exchanges ( mean field solution ) ; in the former case the poverty line is @xmath27 and above this threshold the distribution of agents is an exponential @xmath28 , with @xmath29 @xcite , i.e. , there are exponentially few rich agents while the mass of them remains in what we call a _middle class_. in the second case the figure show the globally coupled ( _ mean field _ ) exchanges ( lower curves ) .this corresponds to a situation in which the agents with which the exchange takes place are chosen at random and not based on geographical proximity .this mean field solution exhibits a lower threshold , @xmath30 , and beyond it also an exponential distribution , @xmath28 , but with a higher value of @xmath31 @xcite .the temporal evolution , in the soc state , of the position of the system s minimum and maximum wealth is quite different . while the site of minimum wealth is changing continuously , generating avalanches of all sizes among neighbors , the wealthiest site is stable over relatively long periods of time @xcite as it is represented by the lines in the figure [ g3d ] . indeed , even when affected by an avalanche the maximum can frequently recover its status after a short time .not only the absolute maximum is stable , but also a privileged group , whose wealth is around the same value of the maximum , remains in its prosperous position for quite a while .this group is also privileged by having high wealth values , well above the market average . in the mean - field casethe rich sites are also stable , but over shorter periods of time .we also observed that the probability that the minimum asset agent improve its situation in a time step is relatively high .it is very high at the beginning of the simulation , then it decreases during the transient to finally converge to a finite value , @xmath32 as it is shown on figure [ prob ] .we remark that the probability is well above 0.5 , so this minimum dynamic has the effect of improve , in the average , the situation of the poorer agents .inequalities are related to social and economic phenomena and is a subject of much debate .the fraction of rich and poor people in a country depends on the inequalities of the income distribution .the standard way to determine the inequality of a wealth distribution is with the help of quintile tables that show the percentage of national income received by equal percentiles of individuals or households ranked by their per capita income levels .for example in a welfare state as sweden the richest 20 percent of the population receives about 4 times more than the poorest quintile , while in a _ ruthless _ capitalistic country like brazil the richest quintile receives more than 25 times more than the poorest quintile .table 1 gives the quintile data for a few countries , while full data can be obtained in the world bank site@xcite .           to measure income inequality in a country and to make a comparison among countries more accurately , economists use lorenz curves and gini indexes .a lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income against the cumulative percentages of recipients . in fig [ gini ]we have represented the lorenz curves for brazil , sweden and spain . for comparison ,we have plotted in same figure the lorenz curve of an hypothetical absolutely equalitarian income distribution that is the straight line with slope equal 1 .this figure shows that brazil s lorenz curve strongly deviates from the hypothetical line of absolute equality while that for sweden lies much nearer and that for spain in the middle of both .this means that of these three countries , brazil has the highest income inequality and sweden the lowest. we also constructed lorenz curves for the local and global cases of cemm model ( figure [ gini ] ) .clearly we see that the global case have a lorenz curve very similar to sweden , while the local case is close to perfect equality .the gini index is even more convenient than a lorenz curve when the task is to compare income inequality among many countries ; it is calculated as the area between a lorenz curve and the hypothetical line of absolute equality .it assumes values between 0 percent ( perfect equality ) and 100 percent . of course , real gini indexes are always in between .we calculated the gini index for the local and global cases .for the local case , the gini index is 8.07 , close to perfect equality , while its value is 24.71 for the global one ( figure [ gini ] ) .this last value is very close to that sweden ( 25.0 ) , and also close to values of other european developed countries .concluding , the analysis of the gini index shows that globalization ( mean field case ) increases the economic inequalities in a conservative economy .moreover , the poverty line in global case is well bellow that of the local case ( figure [ distrisal ] ) .another interesting aspect is that the minimum dynamic favors the poorest agent , so promoting wealth redistribution in the sense defined by rawls @xcite .also , from a strictly economic point of view , high inequality means lower exchanges , and so it implies in a reduction of the economic activity .","answer":"we analyze a conservative market model for the competition among economic agents in a close society .  a minimum dynamics ensures that the poorest agent has a chance to improve its economic welfare . after a transient  , the system self -

By doing so, mixup regularizes the neural network to favor simple linear behavior in-between training examples.  Our experiments on the ImageNet-2012, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Google commands and UCI datasets show that mixup improves the generalization of state-of-the-art neural network architectures.  We also find that mixup reduces the memorization of corrupt labels, increases the robustness to adversarial examples, and stabilizes the training of generative adversarial networks.Large deep neural networks have enabled breakthroughs in fields such as computer vision BID22 , speech recognition , and reinforcement learning BID28 .In most successful applications, these neural networks share two commonalities.First, they are trained as to minimize their average error over the training data, a learning rule also known as the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) principle BID35 .Second, the size of these state-of-theart neural networks scales linearly with the number of training examples.For instance, the network of BID31 used 10 6 parameters to model the 5 · 10 4 images in the CIFAR-10 dataset, the network of BID30 Strikingly, a classical result in learning theory BID36 tells us that the convergence of ERM is guaranteed as long as the size of the learning machine (e.g., the neural network) does not increase with the number of training data.Here, the size of a learning machine is measured in terms of its number of parameters or, relatedly, its VC-complexity BID16 .Thiscontradiction challenges the suitability of ERM to train our current neural network models, as highlighted in recent research. On theone hand, ERM allows large neural networks to memorize (instead of generalize from) the training data even in the presence of strong regularization, or in classification problems where the labels are assigned at random . On theother hand, neural networks trained with ERM change their predictions drastically when evaluated on examples just outside the training distribution BID33 , also known as adversarial examples. This evidencesuggests that ERM is unable to explain or provide generalization on testing distributions that differ only slightly from the training data. However, whatis the alternative to ERM?The method ofchoice to train on similar but different examples to the training data is known as data augmentation BID29 , formalized by the Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) principle BID3 . In VRM, humanknowledge is required to describe a vicinity or neighborhood around each example in the training data. Then, additionalvirtual examples can be drawn from the vicinity distribution of the training examples to enlarge the support of the training distribution. For instance, whenperforming image classification, it is common to define the vicinity of one image as the set of its horizontal reflections, slight rotations, and mild scalings. While data augmentationconsistently leads to improved generalization BID29 , the procedure is dataset-dependent, and thus requires the use of expert knowledge. Furthermore, data augmentationassumes that the examples in the vicinity share the same class, and does not model the vicinity relation across examples of different classes.Contribution Motivated by these issues, we introduce a simple and data-agnostic data augmentation routine, termed mixup (Section 2). In a nutshell, mixup constructsvirtual training examples DISPLAYFORM0 where x i , x j are raw input vectors y = λy i + (1 − λ)y j , where y i , y j are one-hot label encodings (x i , y i ) and (x j , y j ) are two examples drawn at random from our training data, and λ ∈ [0, 1]. Therefore, mixup extends the trainingdistribution by incorporating the prior knowledge that linear interpolations of feature vectors should lead to linear interpolations of the associated targets. mixup can be implemented in a few linesof code, and introduces minimal computation overhead.Despite its simplicity, mixup allows a new state-of-the-art performance in the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-2012 image classification datasets (Sections 3.1 and 3.2). Furthermore, mixup increases the robustnessof neural networks when learning from corrupt labels (Section 3.4), or facing adversarial examples (Section 3.5). Finally, mixup improves generalization on speech(Sections 3.3) and tabular (Section 3.6) data, and can be used to stabilize the training of GANs (Section 3.7). The source-code necessary to replicate our CIFAR-10experiments is available at:https://github.com/facebookresearch/mixup-cifar10.To understand the effects of various design choices in mixup, we conduct a thorough set of ablation study experiments (Section 3.8). The results suggest that mixup performs significantlybetter than related methods in previous work, and each of the design choices contributes to the final performance. We conclude by exploring the connections to prior work(Section 4), as well as offering some points for discussion (Section 5).We have proposed mixup, a data-agnostic and straightforward data augmentation principle.We have shown that mixup is a form of vicinal risk minimization, which trains on virtual examples constructed as the linear interpolation of two random examples from the training set and their labels.Incorporating mixup into existing training pipelines reduces to a few lines of code, and introduces little or no computational overhead.Throughout an extensive evaluation, we have shown that mixup improves the generalization error of state-of-the-art models on ImageNet, CIFAR, speech, and tabular datasets.Furthermore, mixup helps to combat memorization of corrupt labels, sensitivity to adversarial examples, and instability in adversarial training.In our experiments, the following trend is consistent: with increasingly large α, the training error on real data increases, while the generalization gap decreases.This sustains our hypothesis that mixup implicitly controls model complexity.However, we do not yet have a good theory for understanding the 'sweet spot' of this bias-variance trade-off.For example, in CIFAR-10 classification we can get very low training error on real data even when α → ∞ (i.e., training only on averages of pairs of real examples), whereas in ImageNet classification, the training error on real data increases significantly with α → ∞.Based on our ImageNet and Google commands experiments with different model architectures, we conjecture that increasing the model capacity would make training error less sensitive to large α, hence giving mixup a more significant advantage.mixup also opens up several possibilities for further exploration.First, is it possible to make similar ideas work on other types of supervised learning problems, such as regression and structured prediction?While generalizing mixup to regression problems is straightforward, its application to structured prediction problems such as image segmentation remains less obvious.Second, can similar methods prove helpful beyond supervised learning?The interpolation principle seems like a reasonable inductive bias which might also help in unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning.Can we extend mixup to feature-label extrapolation to guarantee a robust model behavior far away from the training data?Although our discussion of these directions is still speculative, we are excited about the possibilities mixup opens up, and hope that our observations will prove useful for future development.","answer":"Training on convex combinations between random training examples and their labels improves generalization in deep neural networks"},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a biomedical research paper.

Please answer the question based on the provided context. Do not include any text in your response other than the answer.Question: What is the function of transthyretin in cerebrospinal fluid?Context: Transthyretin (TTR) is a protein that binds and distributes thyroid hormones (THs). TTR synthesised in the liver is secreted into the bloodstream and distributes THs around the body, whereas TTR synthesised in the choroid plexus is involved in movement of thyroxine from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid and the distribution of THs in the brain. This is important because an adequate amount of TH is required for normal development of the brain.The choroid plexus forms the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. In reptiles, birds and mammals, the main protein synthesized and secreted by the choroid plexus is a thyroid hormone distributor protein: transthyretin. This transthyretin is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid and moves thyroid hormones from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid. Maximal transthyretin synthesis in the choroid plexus occurs just prior to the period of rapid brain growth, suggesting that choroid plexus-derived transthyretin moves thyroid hormones from blood into cerebrospinal fluid just prior to when thyroid hormones are required for rapid brain growth.Transthyretin (TTR) is a visceral protein, which facilitates the transport of thyroid hormones in blood and cerebrospinal fluid.Serum TH binding proteins play a major role for the availability of TH since only free hormone concentrations may dictate cellular uptake. One of these proteins, transthyretin is also present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after being secreted by the choroid plexus. Entry routes into the brain like the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and the blood-CSF-barrier will be explicated regarding fetal and adult status.Some POPs, i.e., hydroxylated metabolites of polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs), pentachlorophenol (PCP), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), compete with thyroxin (T4) for binding sites on transthyretin (TTR), a T4 transport protein found in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.Transthyretin (TTR), a plasma and cerebrospinal fluid protein secreted by the liver and choroid plexus, is mainly known as the physiological carrier of thyroxine (T(4)) and retinol.The secretion of transthyretin by the choroid plexus into the cerebrospinal fluid may have an important function in the transport of thyroxine from the blood to the brain.This transthyretin is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid and moves thyroid hormones from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid.Thyroid hormones enter the choroid plexus via thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters and leave the choroid plexus to enter the cerebrospinal fluid via either thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters or via choroid plexus-derived transthyretin secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid.This transthyretin is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid and moves thyroid hormones from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluidMaximal transthyretin synthesis in the choroid plexus occurs just prior to the period of rapid brain growth, suggesting that choroid plexus-derived transthyretin moves thyroid hormones from blood into cerebrospinal fluid just prior to when thyroid hormones are required for rapid brain growthThyroid hormones enter the choroid plexus via thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters and leave the choroid plexus to enter the cerebrospinal fluid via either thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters or via choroid plexus-derived transthyretin secreted into the cerebrospinal fluidTransthyretin (TTR) is a visceral protein, which facilitates the transport of thyroid hormones in blood and cerebrospinal fluidTransthyretin (TTR) is a plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-circulating homotetrameric proteinSome POPs, i.e., hydroxylated metabolites of polychlorinated biphenyls (OH-PCBs), pentachlorophenol (PCP), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), compete with thyroxin (T4) for binding sites on transthyretin (TTR), a T4 transport protein found in plasma and cerebrospinal fluidTransthyretin (TTR) is a homotetrameric serum and cerebrospinal fluid protein that transports both thyroxine (T(4)) and the retinol-retinol binding protein complex (holoRBP)Dose-dependent transthyretin inhibition of T4 uptake from cerebrospinal fluid in sheep.The secretion of transthyretin by the choroid plexus into the cerebrospinal fluid may have an important function in the transport of thyroxine from the blood to the brain.High-affinity cellular binding sites for TTR have been described; however, their function and that of choroid plexus synthesis of TTR and transport of T4 into the cerebrospinal fluid remain unclear.Transthyretin is the major thyroxine-binding protein in the plasma of rodents, and the main thyroxine-binding protein in the cerebrospinal fluid of both rodents and humans.This transthyretin is secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid and moves thyroid hormones from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid.Thyroid hormones enter the choroid plexus via thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters and leave the choroid plexus to enter the cerebrospinal fluid via either thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters or via choroid plexus-derived transthyretin secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid.","answer":"Transthyretin (TTR) is a protein synthesized in the choroid plexus, which forms the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier.

After 15 min, potassium chlorate was added into the system - very slowly to prevent strong reaction during the oxidation process. After reacting for 96 h, the mixture was diluted by de-ionized (DI) water and then filtered. The GO was next washed by hydrochloric acid to remove sulfate ions from the solution, which could be detected by adding BaCl2 in solution.

The human eye malformation aniridia results from haploinsufficiency of PAX6, a paired box DNA-binding protein. To study this dosage effect, we characterized two PAX6 mutations in a family segregating aniridia and a milder syndrome consisting of congenital cataracts and late onset corneal dystrophy. The nonsense mutations, at codons 103 and 353, truncate PAX6 within the N-terminal paired and C-terminal PST domains, respectively. The wild-type PST domain activates transcription autonomously and the mutant form has partial activity. A compound heterozygote had severe craniofacial and central nervous system defects and no eyes. The pattern of malformations is similar to that in homozygous Sey mice and suggests a critical role for PAX6 in controlling the migration and differentiation of specific neuronal progenitor cells in the brain..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"no eyes\\", \\"congenital cataracts\\", \\"haploinsufficiency of PAX6\\", \\"anophthalmia\\", \\"aniridia\\", \\"corneal dystrophy\\", \\"craniofacial and central nervous system defects\\", \\"central nervous system defects\\"]}"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats.

A randomized trial was conducted to compare PEG tubes and NGT in terms of nutritional outcomes, complications, patient satisfaction and cost. The study was closed early because of poor accrual, predominantly due to patients' reluctance to be randomized. There were 33 patients eligible for analysis. Nutritional support with both tubes was good. There were no significant differences in overall complication rates, chest infection rates or in patients' assessment of their overall quality of life. The cost of a PEG tube was 10 times that of an NGT. The duration of use of PEG tubes was significantly longer, a median 139 days compared with a median 66 days for NGT. We found no evidence to support the routine use of PEG tubes over NGT in this patient group.","answer":"There is not sufficient evidence to determine the optimal method of enteral feeding for patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy and/or chemoradiotherapy. Further trials of the two methods of enteral feeding, incorporating larger sample sizes, are required."},{"question":"Below is an abstract from a computer science research paper.

Although interleukin (IL) -12 was originally purified from an Epstein-Barr (EBV) -transformed B cell line and the high correlation of EBV infection and IL-12 expression has been suggested, no study has reported whether EBV infection is directly linked to IL-12 expression. To address this issue, we have investigated IL-12 expression in B cells during in vitro transformation with EBV. Human peripheral B cells became capable of constitutively producing p40 by in vitro transformation with EBV, coincident with the expression of latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of EBV. These B cells expressed p40 and p35 mRNA, and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulation strongly enhanced p40 and p70 production. Furthermore, transfection with LMP1 expression vector into a human B lymphoma cell line, Daudi, led to p40 production with nuclear factor (NF) -kappaB activation. These results suggest that transformation of primary B cells with EBV induces IL-12 expression potentially through LMP1 expression.

Instead, we present a novel virtual Try-On network, M2E-Try On Net, which transfers the clothes from a model image to a person image without the need of any clean product images. To obtain a realistic image of person wearing the desired model clothes, we aim to solve the following challenges: 1) non-rigid nature of clothes - we need to align poses between the model and the user; 2) richness in textures of fashion items - preserving the fine details and characteristics of the clothes is critical for photo-realistic transfer; 3) variation of identity appearances - it is required to fit the desired model clothes to the person identity seamlessly. To tackle these challenges, we introduce three key components, including the pose alignment network (PAN), the texture refinement network (TRN) and the fitting network (FTN). Since it is unlikely to gather image pairs of input person image and desired output image (i.e. person wearing the desired clothes), our framework is trained in a self-supervised manner to gradually transfer the poses and textures of the model's clothes to the desired appearance. In the experiments, we verify on the Deep Fashion dataset and MVC dataset that our method can generate photo-realistic images for the person to try-on the model clothes. Furthermore, we explore the model capability for different fashion items, including both upper and lower garments.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: We present an approach to efficiently detect the 2D pose of multiple people in an image. The approach uses a nonparametric representation, which we refer to as Part Affinity Fields (PAFs), to learn to associate body parts with individuals in the image. The architecture encodes global context, allowing a greedy bottom-up parsing step that maintains high accuracy while achieving realtime performance, irrespective of the number of people in the image. The architecture is designed to jointly learn part locations and their association via two branches of the same sequential prediction process. Our method placed first in the inaugural COCO 2016 keypoints challenge, and significantly exceeds the previous state-of-the-art result on the MPII Multi-Person benchmark, both in performance and efficiency.[2]: In this work we establish dense correspondences between an RGB image and a surface-based representation of the human body, a task we refer to as dense human pose estimation. We gather dense correspondences for 50K persons appearing in the COCO dataset by introducing an efficient annotation pipeline. We then use our dataset to train CNN-based systems that deliver dense correspondence 'in the wild', namely in the presence of background, occlusions and scale variations. We improve our training set's effectiveness by training an inpainting network that can fill in missing ground truth values and report improvements with respect to the best results that would be achievable in the past. We experiment with fully-convolutional networks and region-based models and observe a superiority of the latter. We further improve accuracy through cascading, obtaining a system that delivers highly-accurate results at multiple frames per second on a single gpu. Supplementary materials, data, code, and videos are provided on the project page http: densepose.org.","answer":"Apart from human parsing for part segmentation, the works in [1] [2] studied human pose estimation for pose analysis.

The overall 3- and 5-year survival rates for combined treatment were 41% and 33%, respectively, compared with 28% and 21% for radical radiotherapy. The operative mortality was 7.8%. The difference between the two treatments in favour of the combined treatment has not yet reached the generally accepted level of significance (P less than 0.05), the p factors for the 3- and 5-year results being 0.064 and 0.077, respectively. Of patients receiving the protocol combined treatment, reduction in tumour stage was found in the surgical specimen in 47% of cases. The overall incidence of nodal metastases was 23% (against the usual figure of 40-50%), and in the presence of a good response of the primary tumour to irradiation, only 8%. The 3- and 5-year survival rates for the down-staged cases were 66% and 55%, respectively, compared with 29% and 22% for patients showing no stage reduction in the surgical specimen. The aim of our future studies is to find effective radiosensitising and cytotoxic agents with which to try and increase the incidence and degree of tumour response to pre-operative irradiation in the combined modality treatment of T3 bladder cancers.","answer":"The analysis of this review suggests that there is an overall survival benefit with radical surgery compared to radical radiotherapy in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

Selective radical reactions are therefore oen enabled by rapid, innate chains (usually requiring fast and exothermic steps) or efficient transformations to long-lived (non-radical) intermediates (i.e. radical-polar crossover). To enable efficient chains, a polarity match of radical and reaction partner has to be given, otherwise non-productive side reactions with lower activation barriers will be the preferred pathways for these \\"impatient\\" intermediates. 5 Amongst the elementary steps within radical chain reactions, radical additions to different p-bonds, 6 which represent an efficient means to C-C bond formation, are quite well understood. 7 In principle, selectivity in radical additions for two competitive reaction steps is determined by the difference in activation barriers: this kinetic control is usually governed by a polarity match between an electrophilic radical and a nucleophilic double bond, or vice versa. It is, however, rather challenging to control such a selectivity, when multiple addition sites with matching polarity and, in turn, similarly low barriers are available. As an example, the classical Minisci-type addition of nucleophilic radicals to electron-decient heterocycles such as pyridine oen yields a mixture of 2-and 4substitution. In such systems, as well as e.g. for benzene rings or asymmetrical dienes, it remains challenging to predict the site selectivity of the radical addition of a given radical (see Fig. 1). 8 Building on our recent study on the radical addition to carbonyls, in which aromatic aldehydes and ketones act as radical acceptors for alkyl radicals under Brønsted acid activation, we investigated the selectivity of the radical addition to the C-O vs. C-C double bond in Michael acceptors. 9</p><p>In these systems (see Fig. 1), which exhibit two electrophilic addition sites, perfect regio-and chemoselectivity of alkyl radical additions was observed. We hypothesized that this selectivity is not determined by the addition itself, but by the consecutive electron transfer. Interestingly, this concept of radical selectivity control through consecutive steps has only been rarely applied, e.g. for controlling a radical metalation through a consecutive favoured/disfavoured cyclization, 10 or to direct a reversible radical cyclization by selective radical-polar crossover. 11 To the best of our knowledge, using electron transfer steps for controlling the selectivity of radical chain reactions has remained, to this date, elusive.</p>Results and discussion<p>To investigate the selectivity of the radical addition to C-O vs. C-C double bonds, Michael acceptors were chosen as radical acceptors. To enable an overall redox-neutral transformation, silyl ketene acetals were applied as radical precursors. In combination with an oxidizing photoredox catalyst, these substrates form amphiphilic alkyl radicals 12 aer single electron oxidation, which subsequently can add to p-bonds.</p><p>Irradiating silyl ketene acetal 1 in the presence of the photocatalyst [Ir(dF-CF 3 -ppy) 2 (dtbpy)]PF 6 (PC-1) and different Michael acceptors 2, an unexpected chemoselectivity switch was observed: whereas the addition to a,b-unsaturated esters and ketones afforded the Giese-type 1,4-addition product, the reaction of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes selectively formed allylic alcohols as products of a formal 1,2-addition. To rationalize this switch in reactivity, experimental and computational mechanistic analyses were conducted.</p>Mechanistic studies<p>As a rst model system the reaction between trimethyl silyl ketene acetal (1a) and methyl acrylate (2a) was investigated in detail. In the absence of either light or photocatalyst, no product was detected, which corroborates a photochemical reaction pathway. In steady-state absorption measurements, the photocatalyst was conrmed to be the only visible-light-absorbing component in the reaction mixture. Stern-Volmer analysis and nanosecond-transient absorption spectroscopy (ns-TAS) suggest an effective quenching of the electronically exited state of PC-1 by silyl ketene acetal 1. Upon irradiation PC-1 gives rise to a MLCT triplet state featuring a 2.49 AE 0.06 ms lifetime. In ns-TAS experiments, the latter is effectively quenched when silyl ketene acetal 1 is added and gives rise to newly developing transient absorption features. A comparison with the spectro-electrochemical measurements (see ESI for further details †) infers the reduction of PC-1 to afford PC-1 À . 13 The underlying electron transfer from the silyl ketene acetal 1 to photoexcited catalyst PC-1 occurs with diffusion-controlled dynamics: k ET ¼ (1.25 AE 0.02) 10 9 L mol À1 s À1 . A high quantum yield (4 ¼ 15.6) suggests that this quenching step initiates an efficient chain reaction. 14 Considering that the addition of trimethylsilyl triuoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf, without irradiation) did not lead to product formation, a radical pathway rather than a Lewis-acid-mediated mechanism is likely to be operative.</p><p>With these results in hand, we propose the following general mechanism (see Fig. 2): silyl ketene acetal 1 is oxidized by photocatalyst PC-1. The resulting radical cation A then fragments to the respective a-carbonyl radical B, 15 which adds to the Lewis-acid-activated a,b-unsaturated carbonyl C to yield radical cation D. 16 Intermediate D is readily reduced by the excess of silyl ketene acetal 1, 17 which closes the radical chain cycle and yields intermediate E. Removal of the trimethylsilyl group by aqueous or uoride workup leads to the nal product.</p><p>Additional support for such a reaction mechanism came from further mechanistic experiments (see ESI for further details †): upon addition of TEMPO to the reaction mixture, TEMPO adducts of intermediates B and D could be detected, while intermediate E was identied by means of ESI-MS. Furthermore, experiments using deuterated reaction solvent excluded the possibility of a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) event from a solvent molecule. Overall, the thermodynamic feasibility of the chain propagation step was supported by the calculated redox potentials, which underline that oxidation of silyl ketene acetal 1 by intermediate D is feasible (E 1 ¼ +0.46 V vs. SCE, E D ¼ +0.96 V vs. SCE). 18 For a,b-unsaturated aldehydes the observed 1,2-addition can be rationalized by an analogous hole catalysis mechanism (E D ¼ +1.63 V vs. SCE). Here, photocatalyst and light are required for the reaction to proceed as well. Notably, the addition of TMSOTf (without irradiation) leads to exclusive formation of the 1,4addition product. Since no 1,2-addition product was observed under these Lewis acid conditions, a radical pathway rather than a Lewis-acid-mediated mechanism is likely to be operative under the standard reaction conditions. For a,b-unsaturated ketones, however, a competing Lewis-acid-mediated chain reaction could not be fully excluded. 19 To understand the difference in behaviour of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes and esters, a computational analysis of the proposed radical chain processes was conducted. Density functional theory calculations were performed at the B3LYP-D3/ def2-TZVPP/CPCM(MeCN) level. Activation barriers for the electron transfer steps were estimated using the four-point approximation to Marcus-Hush theory (see ESI for further details †). 20 Although not widely established, this method was applied to different cases in organic chemistry to estimate electron transfer barriers. 21 Therefore, we believe that this methodology should result in a reasonable estimation of the electron transfer activation barrier (see Fig. 3).</p><p>For a,b-unsaturated aldehydes (see Fig. 3A), a highly oxidizing radical cation D 4 can be formed via a reversible radical C-O addition, which can undergo a fast electron transfer as consecutive reaction. Crucial for the selectivity is the electron transfer barrier, which is seemingly lower for the 1,2-addition product (DG ‡ ¼ 3.8 kcal mol À1 ) than for the respective 1,4addition product (DG ‡ ¼ 11.8 kcal mol À1 ). As such, we propose that, in a Curtin-Hammett-type scenario, the electron transfer is the selectivity determining step, which accounts for the 1,2over 1,4-preference. This conclusion is in agreement with the computed redox potentials, since the 1,2-addition product (E D ¼ +1.63 V vs. SCE) shows a higher oxidation potential than the 1,4-addition product (E D ¼ +1.21 V vs. SCE) and therefore undergoes a faster electron transfer.</p><p>For a,b-unsaturated esters, a different selectivity is observed (see Fig. 3B). Here, a rather high activation barrier is calculated for the 1,2-radical addition (DG ‡ ¼ 26.9 kcal mol À1 ), which renders the reaction less favourable compared to the 1,4-addition product (DG ‡ ¼ 12.6 kcal mol À1 ). Furthermore, the lower activation barrier of the electron transfer for the 1,4-addition product compared to the 1,2-addition product, additionally accounts for the selectivity towards the 1,4-addition. We reason that also here the observed selectivity is determined by the nal chain-propagating electron transfer step. Both computed reaction proles are in good agreement with the experimental observation and support our hypothesis of selectivity control through the consecutive step. 22</p>Reaction scope<p>With these mechanistic insights in hand, we sought to investigate the applicability of this protocol to functionalize aldehydes in 1,2-as well as esters and ketones in 1,4-fashion. The reaction was applied to several different silyl ketene acetals and Michael acceptors. As standard conditions, a solution of Michael acceptor 2 (1.0 eq.), silyl ketene acetal 1 (1.5 eq.) and PC-1 (1.0 mol%) in MeCN (0.1 M) was irradiated with 455 nm LEDs for 16 h (see Fig. 4).</p><p>Applying these conditions, esters and ketones showed high regio-and chemoselectivity towards the 1,4-addition product. Substituents at the a-position (3b, 3c) and alkene functionalities (3d) in the acceptor were well tolerated. Furthermore, diverse secondary and tertiary silyl ketene acetals could be applied (3gi). For a,b-unsaturated ketones, 1,4-addition could be observed exclusively, although full conversion could not be achieved in all cases. This reaction was shown to be applicable for the functionalization of cyclopentenone (3m) and chromone (3n) in high yields. 4-Phenylbutenones (3o-q) could also be applied leading to decent yields. Employed a,b-unsaturated aldehydes could be functionalized with exclusive selectivity for the 1,2addition product. Aliphatic a,b-unsaturated aldehydes underwent the transformation in good yields (4a-b). Moreover, cinnamaldehydes with different substituents in the aromatic ring (4c-f) and in a-position (4g) could be transformed in decent yields. The same reaction conditions could be applied to benzaldehydes (4h-l) in synthetically useful yields, while tolerating double bonds or esters in the side chains.</p>Conclusions<p>With this method, a radical alternative to the well-studied ionic Mukaiyama-Michael/Aldol-reaction was developed. 23 This variant does not require any external Lewis acid, allowing for good functional group tolerance and for the generation of quaternary carbon centers under mild reaction conditions. a,b-Unsaturated esters and ketones show a high selectivity towards the 1,4-addition products, while a,b-unsaturated aldehydes form the 1,2-addition product exclusively. Computational studies suggest that the high regio-and chemoselectivity of the reaction is not determined by the radical addition itself, but by the subsequent electron transfer step, which propagates the radical chain. The control of regioselectivity of radical additions through a consecutive step represents a previously underestimated strategy which shows potential for further reaction design towards switchable selective radical additions.</p>Conflicts of interest<p>There are no conicts to declare.</p>","answer":"Investigations into the selectivity of intermolecular alkyl radical additions to C-O-vs. C-C-double bonds in a,b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds are described. Therefore, a photoredox-initiated radical chain reaction is explored, where the activation of the carbonyl-group through an in situ generated Lewis acid originating from the substrateenables the formation of either C-O or the C-C-addition products.a,b-Unsaturated aldehydes form selectively 1,2-, while esters and ketones form the corresponding 1,4addition products exclusively. Computational studies lead to reason that this chemo-and regioselectivity is determined by the consecutive step, i.e. an electron transfer, after reversible radical addition, which eventually propagates the radical chain."},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper. Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: Among the 16 diagnostics studies selected, one study discussed the use of RT-PCR in diagnosing patients with 2019-nCoV [11] ( Table 1 ). The period and type of specimen collected for RT-PCR play an important role in the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV. It was found that the respiratory specimens were positive for the virus while serum was negative in the early period. It has also suggested that in the early days of illness, patients have high levels of virus despite the mild symptoms. Apart from the commonly used RT-PCR in diagnosing MERS-CoV, four studies identified various diagnostic methods such as reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), RT-insulated isothermal PCR (RT-iiPCR) and a one-step rRT-PCR assay based on specific TaqMan probes. RT-LAMP has similar sensitivity as real time RT-PCR. It is also highly specific and is used to detect MERS-CoV. It is comparable to the usual diagnostic tests and is rapid, simple and convenient. Likewise, RT-iiPCR and a one-step rRT-PCR assay have also shown similar sensitivity and high specificity for MER-CoV. Lastly, one study focused on the validation of the six commercial real RT-PCR kits, with high accuracy. Although real time RT-PCR is a primary method for diagnosing MERS-CoV, high levels of PCR inhibition may hinder PCR sensitivity (Table 1) . There are eleven studies that focus on SARS-CoV diagnostic testing (Table 1) . These papers described diagnostic methods to detect the virus with the majority of them using molecular testing for diagnosis. Comparison between the molecular test (i.e RT-PCR) and serological test (i.e., ELISA) showed that the molecular test has better sensitivity and specificity. Hence, enhancements to the current molecular test were conducted to improve the diagnosis. Studies looked at using nested PCR to include a pre-amplification step or incorporating N gene as an additional sensitive molecular marker to improve on the sensitivity (Table 1 ). In addition, there are seven potential rapid diagnostic kits (as of 24 January 2020; Table 2 ) available on the market for 2019-nCoV. Six of these are only for research purposes. Only one kit from Beijing Genome Institute (BGI) is approved for use in the clinical setting for rapid diagnosis. Most of the kits are for RT-PCR. There were two kits (BGI, China and Veredus, Singapore) with the capability to detect multiple pathogens using sequencing and microarray technologies, respectively. The limit of detection of the enhanced realtime PCR method was 10 2 -fold higher than the standard real-time PCR assay and 10 7fold higher than conventional PCR methods In the clinical aspect, the enhanced realtime PCR method was able to detect 6 cases of SARS-CoV positive samples that were not confirmed by any other assay [25] • The real time PCR has a threshold sensitivity of 10 genome equivalents per reaction and it has a good reproducibility with the inter-assay coefficients of variation of 1.73 to 2.72%. • 13 specimens from 6 patients were positive with viral load range from 362 to 36,240,000 genome equivalents/mL. The real-time RT-PCR reaction was more sensitive than the nested PCR reaction, as the detection limit for the nested PCR reaction was about 10 3 genome equivalents in the standard cDNA control. [34] Real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rRT-PCR); RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp); open reading frame 1a (ORF1a); Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP); enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); immunofluorescent assay (IFA); immunochromatographic test (ICT); nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA). With the emergence of 2019-nCoV, there are about 15 potential vaccine candidates in the pipeline globally (Table 3 ), in which a wide range of technology (such as messenger RNA, DNA-based, nanoparticle, synthetic and modified virus-like particle) was applied. It will likely take about a year for most candidates to start phase 1 clinical trials except for those funded by Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). However, the kit developed by the BGI have passed emergency approval procedure of the National Medical Products Administration, and are currently used in clinical and surveillance centers of China [40] . Of the total of 570 unique studies on 2019-nCoV, SARS CoV or MERS-CoV vaccines screened, only four were eventually included in the review. Most studies on SARS and MERS vaccines were excluded as they were performed in cell or animal models ( Figure 1 ). The four studies included in this review were Phase I clinical trials on SARS or MERS vaccines (Table 4 ) [44] [45] [46] [47] . There were no studies of any population type (cell, animal, human) on the 2019-nCoV at the point of screening. The published clinical trials were mostly done in United States except for one on the SARS vaccine done in China [44] . All vaccine candidates for SARS and MERS were reported to be safe, well-tolerated and able to trigger the relevant and appropriate immune responses in the participants. In addition, we highlight six ongoing Phase I clinical trials identified in the ClinicalTrials.gov register ( [48, 49] ); Table  S4 ) [50] [51] [52] . These trials are all testing the safety and immunogenicity of their respective MERS-CoV vaccine candidates but were excluded as there are no results published yet. The trials are projected to complete in December 2020 (two studies in Russia [50, 51] ) and December 2021 (in Germany [52] ). Existing literature search did not return any results on completed 2019-nCoV trials at the time of writing. Among 23 trials found from the systematic review (Table 5) , there are nine clinical trials registered under the clinical trials registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) for 2019-nCoV therapeutics [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] . Of which five studies on hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir plus ritonavir and arbidol, mesenchymal stem cells, traditional Chinese medicine and glucocorticoid therapy usage have commenced recruitment. The remaining four studies encompass investigation of antivirals, interferon atomization, darunavir and cobicistat, arbidol, and remdesivir usage for 2019-nCoV patients (Table 5) . Seroconversion measured by S1-ELISA occurred in 86% and 94% participants after 2 and 3 doses, respectively, and was maintained in 79% participants up to study end at week 60. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 50% participants at one or more time points during the study, but only 3% maintained neutralisation activity to end of study. T-cell responses were detected in 71% and 76% participants after 2 and 3 doses, respectively. There were no differences in immune responses between dose groups after 6 weeks and vaccine-induced humoral and cellular responses were respectively detected in 77% and 64% participants at week 60 . [47] Molecules developed by the university scientists inhibit two coronavirus enzymes and prevent its replication. The discovered drug targets are said to be more than 95% similar to enzyme targets found on the SARS virus. Researchers note that identified drugs may not be available to address the ongoing outbreak but they hope to make it accessible for future outbreaks. [85] Besides the six completed randomized controlled trials (RCT) selected from the systematic review (Table 6) , there is only one ongoing randomized controlled trial targeted at SARS therapeutics [92] . The studies found from ClinicalTrials.gov have not been updated since 2013. While many prospective and retrospective cohort studies conducted during the epidemic centered on usage of ribavirin with lopinavir/ritonavir or ribavirin only, there has yet to be well-designed clinical trials investigating their usage. Three completed randomized controlled trials were conducted during the SARS epidemic-3 in China, 1 in Taiwan and 2 in Hong Kong [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] . The studies respectively investigated antibiotic usage involving 190 participants, combination of western and Chinese treatment vs. Chinese treatment in 123 participants, integrative Chinese and Western treatment in 49 patients, usage of a specific Chinese medicine in four participants and early use of corticosteroid in 16 participants. Another notable study was an open non-randomized study investigating ribavirin/lopinavir/ritonavir usage in 152 participants [98] . One randomized controlled trial investigating integrative western and Chinese treatment during the SARS epidemic was excluded as it was a Chinese article [94] . There is only one ongoing randomized controlled trial targeted at MERS therapeutics [99] . It investigates the usage of Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Interferon Beta 1B. Likewise, many prospective and retrospective cohort studies conducted during the epidemic centered on usage of ribavirin with lopinavir/ritonavir/ribavirin, interferon, and convalescent plasma usage. To date, only one trial has been completed. One phase 1 clinical trial investigating the safety and tolerability of a fully human polyclonal IgG immunoglobulin (SAB-301) was found in available literature [46] . The trial conducted in the United States in 2017 demonstrated SAB-301 to be safe and well-tolerated at single doses. Another trial on MERS therapeutics was found on ClinicalTrials.gov-a phase 2/3 trial in the United States evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity on coadministered MERS-CoV antibodies REGN3048 & REGN3051 [100]. Rapid diagnostics plays an important role in disease and outbreak management. The fast and accurate diagnosis of a specific viral infection enables prompt and accurate public health surveillance, prevention and control measures. Local transmission and clusters can be prevented or delayed by isolation of laboratory-confirmed cases and their close contacts quarantined and monitored at home. Rapid diagnostic also facilitates other specific public health interventions such as closure of high-risk facilities and areas associated with the confirmed cases for prompt infection control and environmental decontamination [11, 101] . Laboratory diagnosis can be performed by: (a) detecting the genetic material of the virus, (b) detecting the antibodies that neutralize the viral particles of interest, (c) detecting the viral epitopes of interest with antibodies (serological testing), or (d) culture and isolation of viable virus particles. The key limitations of genetic material detection are the lack of knowledge of the presence of viable virus, the potential cross-reactivity with non-specific genetic regions and the short timeframe for accurate detection during the acute infection phase. The key limitations of serological testing is the need to collect paired serum samples (in the acute and convalescent phases) from cases under investigation for confirmation to eliminate potential cross-reactivity from non-specific antibodies from past exposure and/or infection by other coronaviruses. The limitation of virus culture and isolation is the long duration and the highly specialized skills required of the technicians to process the samples. All patients recovered. Significantly shorted time from the disease onset to the symptom improvement in treatment (5.10 ± 2.83 days) compared to control group (7.62 ± 2.27 days) (p < 0.05) No significant difference in blood routine improvement, pulmonary chest shadow in chest film improvement and corticosteroid usgae between the 2 groups. However, particularly in the respect of improving clinical symptoms, elevating quality of life, promoting immune function recovery, promoting absorption of pulmonary inflammation, reducing the dosage of cortisteroid and shortening the therapeutic course, treatment with integrative chinese and western medicine treatment had obvious superiority compared with using control treatment alone. Single infusions of SAB-301 up to 50 mg/kg appear to be safe and well-tolerated in healthy participants. [46] Where the biological samples are taken from also play a role in the sensitivity of these tests. For SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, specimens collected from the lower respiratory tract such as sputum and tracheal aspirates have higher and more prolonged levels of viral RNA because of the tropism of the virus. MERS-CoV viral loads are also higher for severe cases and have longer viral shedding compared to mild cases. Although upper respiratory tract specimens such as nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs can be used, they have potentially lower viral loads and may have higher risk of false-negatives among the mild MERS and SARS cases [102, 103] , and likely among the 2019-nCoV cases. The existing practices in detecting genetic material of coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV include (a) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), (b) real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR), (c) reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and (d) real-time RT-LAMP [104] . Nucleic amplification tests (NAAT) are usually preferred as in the case of MERS-CoV diagnosis as it has the highest sensitivity at the earliest time point in the acute phase of infection [102] . Chinese health authorities have recently posted the full genome of 2019-nCoV in the GenBank and in GISAID portal to facilitate in the detection of the virus [11] . Several laboratory assays have been developed to detect the novel coronavirus in Wuhan, as highlighted in WHO's interim guidance on nCoV laboratory testing of suspected cases. These include protocols from other countries such as Thailand, Japan and China [105] . The first validated diagnostic test was designed in Germany. Corman et al. had initially designed a candidate diagnostic RT-PCR assay based on the SARS or SARS-related coronavirus as it was suggested that circulating virus was SARS-like. Upon the release of the sequence, assays were selected based on the match against 2019-nCoV upon inspection of the sequence alignment. Two assays were used for the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene and E gene where E gene assay acts as the first-line screening tool and RdRp gene assay as the confirmatory testing. All assays were highly sensitive and specific in that they did not cross-react with other coronavirus and also human clinical samples that contained respiratory viruses [11] .Question: What were the differences in immune responses?","answer":"no differences in immune responses between dose groups after 6 weeks and vaccine-induced humoral and cellular responses were respectively detected in 77% and 64% participants at week 60"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

Virus Res 2015 Vol 202:60-88 with permission from Elsevier [5] DCs, which make up 95 % of all camels, have a central presence in the Arabian Peninsula where human-DC contact ranges from little to close [119] . Contact may be commonplace and could occur in variety of ways (Fig. 4a) . There are several large well-attended festivals, races, sales and parades which feature DCs and DCs are also kept and bred close to populated areas in the KSA [127, 128] . DC milk and meat are widely consumed and the older DC is an animal of ritual significance after the Hajj pilgrimage [129] . However, MERS-CoV infection frequency is reportedly much lower than is the widespread and frequent habit of eating, drinking and preparing DC products. Daily ingestion of fresh unpasteurized DC milk is common among the desert Bedouin and many others in the KSA. DC urine is also consumed or used for supposed health benefits. Despite camel butchery being a local occupation, neither butchers nor other at-risk groups are identifiable among MERS cases; this may simply be a reporting issue rather than an unexplainable absence of MERS. A small case-control study published in 2015 identified direct DC contact, and not ingestion of products, to be associated with onset of MERS [38] . The first sero-survey of livestock living in the Middle East region was conducted during 2012-2013 [85] . DCs were sampled from a mostly Canary Island-born herd and from Omani DCs (originally imported from the Horn of Africa) [85] . A neutralising antibody assay found only 10 % of strongly seropositive Canary Island [5] . b Camel-to-human infections appear to be infrequent, while human-to-human spread of infection is regularly facilitated by poor IPC in healthcare settings where transmission is amplified, accounting for the bulk of cases. There are human MERS cases that do not fall into either category of source and it is unclear if these acquired infection through some entirely separate route, or from cases that escaped diagnosis. c Hypothetical ways in which subclinical (when infection may not meet a previously defined clinical threshold of signs and/or symptoms) or asymptomatic (no obvious signs or measured, noticed or recalled symptoms of illness) MERS-CoV infection may be implicated in transmission DC sera could neutralise MERS-CoV while all Omani DC sera had high levels of specific MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody [85] . This indicated that DCs had in the past been infected by MERS-CoV, or a very similar virus. Since this study, a host of peer-reviewed reports have looked at both DCs and other animals, and the possibility that they may host MERS-CoV infection. Seropositive DCs have been found throughout the Arabian Peninsula including Oman, the KSA, Qatar, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait as well as Sudan, Somalia, Egypt, Tunisia, Nigeria, Kenya and Ethiopia in Africa and the Canary Islands [85, [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] . Other animals tested include sheep, cows, pigs, horses, donkeys, mules, birds, water buffalo, goats, Bactrian camels, llamas and guanaco (south American camelids) but none had detectable neutralising antibody against MERS-CoV [4, 74, 78, 85, 86, 135, 136] . No virology or serology studies of human samples from areas in Africa where there are camels with a history of MERS-CoV have been reported to date. However,an absence of unexplained pneumonia that may be attributable to MERS-CoV infection may not signal the absence of virus among humans in each country but simply reflect a lack of expensive epidemiology studies conducted by resource-poor countries. It is thus unclear whether MERS-CoV, or an antigenically related CoV, is an unrecognized pathogen in these regions, perhaps circulating for even longer than it has been known in the Arabian Peninsula [133] . MERS-CoV RNA has also been detected in DC samples, and recovery of infectious virus has also been achieved from DC samples [4, 77, 117, 132, [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] . From some of these, full or majority length genomes of MERS-CoV have been sequenced [77, 137, 138] . DC versions of MERS-CoV were found to be as similar to each other, as were variants detected from different humans over time and across distance. Antibody screening assays have also detected crossreactive antibodies in sera. These were identified as such by screening sera against similar viruses, for example BCoV or HCoV-OC43 (as an antigenic facsimile for BCoV). It is possible that other MERS-CoV-like viruses also reside within DCs, but this does not detract from the definitive finding of MERS-CoV genetic sequences in both DCs and humans [117, 142, 143] . Screening studies have shown that juvenile DCs are more often positive for virus or viral RNA while older DCs are more likely to be seropositive and RNA or virus negative [76, 77, 144] . In adult DCs, MERS-CoV RNA has been detected among animals with pre-existing antibody, suggesting re-infection is possible [77, 144] . Viral loads among positive DCs can be very high [4, 76, 77, 139, 144] and DCs have been found positive both when ill with URT respiratory signs [77, 117, 142, 145] or when apparently healthy [137] . These findings indicate DCs host natural MERS-CoV infections. Furthermore, stored DC sera have revealed signs of MERS-CoV in DCs which date back over three decades (the earliest collected in 1983) [4, 133, 135] . Older sera have not been tested and so precisely how long DCs have been afflicted by MERS-CoV, whether the virus is enzootic among them, introduced to them decades or centuries ago from bats in Africa or the Arabian Peninsula, or they are the subject of regular but short-lived viral incursions from an as yet unknown host, cannot be answered. Researchers sought to determine a direction for infection; were DCs transmitting virus to humans or were humans infecting DCs? At a Qatari site, a farm owner and his employee became ill in mid-October 2013 and tested positive for MERS-CoV RNA in a sputum and throat swab sample, respectively. RT-rtPCRs found MERS-CoV RNA in 11 of 14 positive DC nasal swabs at the farm; six (43 %) positive by two or more assays [138] . The results indicated a recent outbreak had occurred in this herd; the first indication of MERS-CoV RNA found within DCs with a temporal association to human infections. Three positive DC samples were confirmed by sequencing a 358 nt portion of the spike gene; these sequences were identical to each other, again with close homology to other human and DC MERS-CoV sequences [138] . The DCs and human contacts yielded ORF1a and ORF4b sequences differing by only a single nucleotide each, clustering closely with the Hafr-Al-Batin_1_2013 variant [138] . Subsequent case studies found evidence of a concurrent human and DC infection and the direction of that infection was inferred to be from the ill DCs and to their human owners [117, 142, 146] . Partial genome sequences indicated that a human and a MERS-CoV RT-rtPCR positive DC had been infected by a variant of the same virus, harbouring the same distinct pattern of nucleotide polymorphisms. [142] All nine DC in the owner's herd, serially sampled, reacted in a recombinant S1 antigen ELISA, with the two animals that had been RT-rtPCR positive showing a small, verifiable rise in antibody titre [142] . A rise in titre theoretically begins 10 to 21 days after DC infection [142] . The authors suggested that the rise in titre in DC sera which occurred alongside a declining RNA load, while the patient was actively ill and hospitalized, indicated that the DCs were infected first followed by the owner [117, 142] . BCoV antibodies were also present, and rising in one of the two RT-rtPCR positive animals but no animal's antibodies could neutralise BCoV infection [142] . Camel calving season occurs in the winter months (between late October and late February; Fig. 3 ) and this may be a time when there is increased risk to humans of spill-over due to new infections among naïve DC populations [128] . What role maternal camel antibody might play in delaying infection of calves remains unknown [128, 142] . Juvenile DCs appear to host active infection more often than adult DCs and thus the sacrificial slaughter of DCs, which must be five years of age or older (termed a thane), may not be accompanied by significant risk of exposure to infection. In contrast to earlier results, slaughterhouse workers who kill both younger and older DCs, may be an occupational group with significantly higher incidence of seropositivity to MERS-CoV when animals have active MERS-CoV infections [129, 139, [147] [148] [149] . Expanded virological investigations of African DCs may lead to more seropositive animals and geographic areas in which humans may be at risk. It is possible that there are areas where humans already harbour MERS-CoV infections that have not been identified because of an absence of laboratory surveillance. Virological investigations of bats may lead to findings of ancestral viruses and viral 'missing links' and identifying any other animal sources of zoonotic spread is important to inform options for reducing human exposures [56, 76] . Infectious MERS-CoV added to DC, goat or cow milk and stored at 4°C could be recovered at least 72 h later and, if stored at 22°C, recovery was possible for up to 48 h [150] . MERS-CoV titre decreased somewhat when recovered from milk at 22°C but pasteurization completely ablated MERS-CoV infectivity [150] . In a subsequent study, MERS-CoV RNA was identified in the milk, nasal secretion and faeces of DCs from Qatar [151] . A single study has examined the ability of MERS-CoV to survive in the environment [150] . Plastic or steel surfaces were inoculated with 10 6 TCID 50 of MERS-CoV at different temperature and relative humidity (RH) and virus recovery was attempted in cell culture. At high ambient temperature (30°C) and low RH (30 %) MERS-CoV remained viable for 24 h [150] . By comparison, a well known and efficently transmitted respiratory virus, influenza A virus, could not be recovered in culture beyond four hours under any conditions [150] . Aerosol experiments found MERS-CoV viability only decreased 7 % at low RH at 20°C. In comparison, influenza A virus decreased by 95 % [150] . MERS-CoV survival is inferior to that previously demonstrated for SARS-CoV [152] . For context, pathogenic bacteria can remain viable and airborne for 45 min in a coughed aerosol and can spread 4 m. MERS-CoV's ability to remain viable over long time periods gives it the capacity to thoroughly contaminate a room's surfaces when occupied by an infected and symptomatic patient [153] . Whether MERS-CoV can remain adrift and infectious for extended periods (truly airborne) remains unknown. Such findings expand our understanding of the possibilities for droplets to transmit respiratory viruses in many settings, including hospital waiting rooms, emergency departments, treatment rooms, open intensive care facilities and private patient rooms. The nature and quality of air exchange, circulation and filtration are important variables in risk measurement and reduction as is the use of negative pressure rooms to contain known cases. Droplet spread between humans is considered the mechanism of human-to-human transmission and the need for droplet precautions was emphasized after the Al-Ahsa hospital, the KSA and the South Korean outbreaks [21, 23, 154, 155] . By extrapolation, aerosol-generating events involving DCs (urination, defecation, and preparation and consumption of DC products) should be factored into risk measurement and reduction efforts and messaged using appropriate context. The provision of evidence supporting the best formulation of personal protective equipment to be worn by HCWs who receive, manage or conduct procedures on infectious cases remains a priority. MERS-CoV was found and characterized because of its apparent association with severe, and therefore more obvious, illness in humans; we were the canaries in the coal mine. Sero-assays and prospective cohort studies have yet to determine the extent to which milder or asymptomatic cases contribute to MERS-CoV transmission chains. However, transmission of MERS-CoV is defined as sporadic (not sustained), intra-familial, often healthcare associated, inefficient and requiring close and prolonged contact [22, 31, 63, 93, 97, 102, 156] In a household study, 14 of 280 (5 %) contacts of 26 MERS-CoV positive index patients were RNA or antibody positive; the rate of general transmission, even in outbreaks is around 3 % [31] . It seems that the majority of human cases of MERS-CoV, even when numbers appear to increase suddenly, do not readily transmit to more than one other human so to date, the localized epidemic of MERS-CoV has not been self-sustaining [157] [158] [159] [160] [161] . That is to say, the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) -the average number of infections caused by one infected individual in a fully susceptible populationhas been close to one throughout various clusters and outbreaks. If R 0 was greater than 1, a sustained increase in case numbers would be expected. Some R o calculations may be affected by incomplete case contact tracing, limited community testing and how a case is defined. That MERS has had a constant presence in the Arabian Peninsula since 2012 is due to ongoing, sporadic spill-over events from DCs amplified by poorly controlled hospital outbreaks.Question: Why has MERS had a constant presence in the Arabian Peninsula?","answer":"due to ongoing, sporadic spill-over events from DCs amplified by poorly controlled hospital outbreaks."},{"question":"You will be shown an excerpt from a computer science scientific research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

Methods A multicentric , r and omized , controlled-trial was conducted to test the efficacy of a 12-week group Lifestyle Wellness Program ( LWP ) . The program consists of a one-hour weekly session to discuss topics like dietary choices , lifestyle , physical activity and self-esteem with patients and their relatives . Patients were r and omized into two groups : st and ard care ( SC ) and st and ard care plus intervention ( LWP ) . Primary outcome was defined as the weight and body mass index ( BMI ) . Results 160 patients participated in the study ( 81 in the intervention group and 79 in the SC group ) . On an intent to treat analysis , after three months the patients in the intervention group presented a decrease of 0.48 kg ( CI 95 % -0.65 to 1.13 ) while the st and ard care group showed an increase of 0.48 kg ( CI 95 % 0.13 to 0.83 ; p=0.055 ) . At six-month follow-up , there was a significant weight decrease of −1.15 kg , ( CI 95 % -2.11 to 0.19 ) in the intervention group compared to a weight increase in the st and ard care group ( + 0.5 kg , CI 95 % -0.42–1.42 , p=0.017 ) . Conclusion In conclusion , this was a multicentric r and omized clinical trial with a lifestyle intervention for individuals with schizophrenia , where the intervention group maintained weight and presented a tendency to decrease weight after 6 months . It is reasonable to suppose that lifestyle interventions may be important long-term strategies to avoid the tendency of these individuals to increase weight .

Twenty participants diagnosed with a non-acute psychotic disorder were recruited . The intervention consisted of eight telephone delivered sessions targeting fruit and vegetable ( F&V ) consumption and leisure screen time , as well as smoking and alcohol use ( as appropriate ) . F&V frequency and variety , and overall diet quality ( measured by the Australian Recommended Food Score , ARFS ) , leisure screen time , overall sitting and walking time , smoking , alcohol consumption , mood , quality of life , and global functioning were examined before and 4-weeks post-treatment . Nineteen participants ( 95 % ) completed all intervention sessions , and 17 ( 85 % ) completed follow-up assessment s. Significant increases from baseline to post-treatment were seen in ARFS fruit , vegetable and overall diet quality scores , quality of life and global functioning . Significant reductions in leisure screen time and overall sitting time were also seen . Results indicated that a telephone delivered intervention targeting key cardiovascular disease risk behaviours appears to be feasible and relatively effective in the short-term for people diagnosed with psychosis . A r and omized controlled trial is warranted to replicate and extend these findingsTitle 3:Exercise therapy improves mental and physical health in schizophrenia: a randomised controlled trialAbstract 3:The objective of this multicenter r and omised clinical trial was to examine the effect of  exercise versus occupational therapy on mental and physical health in schizophrenia patientsTitle 4:The effectiveness of a program of physical activity and diet to modify cardiovascular risk factors in patients with severe mental illness after 3-month follow-up: CAPiCOR randomized clinical trial.Abstract 4:BACKGROUND The aim of this r and omized clinical trial follow-up at three months was to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention with a focus on diet and physical activity ( PA ) to change the amount of PA , body mass index ( BMI ) and the waist circumference ( WC ) in patients with severe mental illness . METHODS We recruited 332 out patients with severe mental disorders undergoing treatment with antipsychotic medication from Mental Healthcare Centers of Barcelona . They were r and omly assigned to an intervention or a control group . The patients in the intervention group participated in a group PA and diet educational program . The blinded measurements at 0 and 3 months were : the level of PA ( IPAQ question naire ) , BMI , WC , blood pressure , dietary habits ( PREDIMED question naire ) , quality of life ( SF-36 question naire ) and laboratory parameters ( cholesterol , triglycerides , glucose ) . RESULTS The average age was 46.7 years and 55 % were males . Schizophrenia had been diagnosed in 67.1 % of them . At 3 months , the average weekly walking METs rose significantly in the IG 266.05 METs ( 95%CI : 16.86 to 515.25 ; P=0.036 ) . The total MET average also rose although not significantly : 191.38 METs ( 95%CI : 1.38 to 381.38 ; P=0.086 ) . However , the BMI decreased significantly more in the CG , by 0.26kg/m(2 ) ( 95%CI : 0.02 to 0.51 ; P=0.038 ) , than in the IG . There were no significant differences in the WC . CONCLUSIONS The short-term results suggest that the intervention increases the level of PA , but does not improve physical or laboratory parameters .

We aim ed to evaluate the effectiveness of a lifestyle and life skills intervention , delivered within 4 weeks of antipsychotic medication initiation , in attenuating weight gain in youth aged 14 - 25 years with first-episode psychosis ( FEP ) . METHODS We undertook a prospect i ve , controlled study in two early psychosis community services . Intervention participants ( n = 16 ) received a 12-week individualized intervention delivered by specialist clinical staff ( nurse , dietician and exercise physiologist ) and youth peer wellness coaches , in addition to st and ard care . A comparison group was recruited from a similar service and received st and ard care  ( n = 12 ) . RESULTS The intervention group experienced significantly less weight gain at 12 weeks compared to st and ard care ( 1.8 kg , 95 % CI -0.4 to 2.8 vs. 7.8 kg , 4.8 - 10.7 , P < 0.001 ) . Thirteen per cent ( 2/16 ) of the intervention group experienced clinical ly significant weight gain ( greater than 7 % of baseline weight ) , while 75 % ( 9/12 ) of the st and ard care group experienced this level of weight gain . Similar positive effects of the intervention were observed for waist circumference . CONCLUSIONS A lifestyle and life skills intervention delivered as part of st and ard care attenuated antipsychotic-induced weight gain in young people with FEP . The intervention was acceptable to the young people referred to the service . Such interventions may prevent the seeding of future disease risk and in the long-term help reduce the life expectancy gap for people living with serious mental illnessTitle 8:A lifestyle intervention for older schizophrenia patients with diabetes mellitus: A randomized controlled trialAbstract 8:PURPOSE We tested the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a lifestyle intervention for middle-aged and older patients with schizophrenia and type-2 diabetes mellitus , using a r and omized pre-test , post-test control group design . METHOD Individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder over the age of 40 were r and omly assigned to 24-week Diabetes Awareness and Rehabilitation Training ( DART ; n=32 ) groups or Usual Care plus Information ( UCI ; n=32 ) comparison groups .  Participants were recruited from board- and -care facilities and day treatment programs . Fifty-seven patients completed baseline and 6-month assessment s consisting of an interview , measures of body mass index , blood pressure , fasting blood chemistry , and accelerometry . A mixed-model analysis of variance was used to analyze the data . RESULTS A significant group x time interaction was found for body weight , with patients in the DART group losing a mean of 5 lb and those in the UCI gaining a mean 6 lb . Significant group x time interactions were also found for triglycerides , diabetes knowledge , diabetes self-efficacy , and self-reported physical activity , but not for fasting plasma glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin .

Influenza viruses had caused a pandemic globally during 1918 and 1919, and that influenza pandemic had taken away more than 20 million people's lives in the world. However, in my opinion, it is unlikely that influenza viruses will again cause a pandemic on a level (both of the morbidity rate and the mortality rate) comparable to what happened in 1918 and 1919. Influenza viruses very easily reassort, recombine, and point mutate in nature due to their segmented RNA genome structures, however, unlike highly pathogenic (virulent) viruses like rabies virus, Lassa fever virus, smallpox virus, eastern equine encephalitis virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1); most influenza viruses (wild types and mutants) are moderately pathogenic. The case fatality rates of some highly virulent viruses and related references are listed in Table 1 . On November 11, 1918 , the fighting of World War I was stopped, and World War I was officially ended on June 28, 1919 with the signing of the Versailles Treaty. It is estimated that around 8.5-10 million soldiers lost their lives in World War I due to battle. The war also directly caused more than 6 million civilian deaths. Millions of people suffered from hunger and malnutrition during the war. Malnutrition weakened the human immune system and made a person more vulnerable to infectious diseases like tuberculosis and influenza, therefore, hunger and malnutrition were indirectly responsible for millions of deaths in the world in that period of time. For example, about 700,000 Germans died from malnutrition-related diseases in the years of 1914-1918. During the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, between 21 and 25 million people died of influenza worldwide. Those people were killed both directly and indirectly by influenza virus infections. Many families were too poor to buy food and coal, and to afford health care expenses when their family members were ill. Influenza virus could infect all members of a family, and this could result in no one left to feed the fires, and to prepare food for the whole family, even if they had firewood, coal, and food left in their homes. Sadly, a large number of people died of influenza virus infections along with starvation, cold, and poor living conditions (8) . In recent years, while hunger and malnutrition are not major and serious problems in some developed countries anymore, they are still very difficult to overcome in many developing countries. In these less-developed countries, there were approximately 925 million people who suffered from hunger; 125 million children were underweight; and 195 million children were stunted each year (9) . Nevertheless, in comparison to 1918 and 1919, currently, we have much better social and economic conditions and public health systems globally; and generally speaking, the majority of people in the world have better nutritional and educational statuses; better living and working conditions; therefore, better general health and immunity. Furthermore, in 1918 and 1919, physicians and nurses almost had nothing in their hands to help individuals who were infected by influenza viruses. Today, although we still do not have very effective, powerful, and practical anti-influenza drugs available, we at least have some improved, useful, and helpful anti-viral drugs like zanamivir, and effective, convenient anti-cold medicines like Tylenol or Advil. We do not have a universal vaccine to prevent all influenza virus infections, but we can make effective vaccines to a specific influenza virus strain in a short time. Actually, in the United States of America, the influenza classed mortality rate declined from 10.2/100,000 in the 1940s to 0.56/100,000 in the 1990s; and the classed mortality rates of 1957-1958 and 1968-1969 influenza pandemics were not remarkably different from the non-pandemic seasons (10) . Because of the above reasons, we can optimistically assume that even the same strain of influenza virus, which caused pandemic in 1918 and 1919, would not be able to kill millions of people and cause a pandemic comparable to the 1918-1919 pandemic again in the future. Additionally, a significant number of viruses can cause influenza-like syndromes, such as rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Coxsackie B virus, echovirus, and metapneumovirus (11, 12) . Some of the above-mentioned viruses like adenovirus and mutated coronavirus could cause problems that are comparable to influenza viruses (13, 14) . The World Health Organization (WHO) mistakenly raised the level of influenza pandemic alert from phase 5 to the highest phase 6 on June 11, 2009 (15) . However, the truth was that most cases of H1N1 influenza A virus infections were mild, the symptomatic case fatality rate was only 0.005% in New Zealand (16) ; and in New York City, the case fatality rate was 0.0094-0.0147% for persons ≥65 years old, and for those of 0-17 years old, the case fatality rate was 0.0008-0.0012% (17) .  Some researchers argued that it should not have been called an influenza pandemic in the first place if the clinical severity was considered (15, (18) (19) (20) . I believe it was unwise that we had paid too much www.frontiersin.org 23) . Not surprisingly, every year there would be some influenza patients and a few of them would die from the infections, as it is almost impossible to eliminate influenza viruses from the natural environment in many years. The severity of a viral infection is determined by both of the viral virulence (pathogenicity) and the host immunity. Some researchers' opinions on H7N9 avian influenza virus were incorrect and/or inadequate. They mainly focused on influenza viruses and worried about viral mutations, viral pathogenicity, viral adaptation, and transmission. They overestimated the negative part of socio-economic factors of the present east China: overcrowded population in the epidemic region; very busy national and international transportation and travel; a large number of live poultry markets . . . but they underestimated the currently changed, developed, and improved positive part of socio-economic factors in China. The following factors might be used to explain why that H7N9 influenza A virus epidemic was limited and controlled in China, and only a few immunocompromised patients were killed by H7N9 influenza A virus. First, China has a relatively organized and effective public health system, there are four levels of (national, provincial, prefectural-level city, and county) centers for disease control and prevention all over China (24) . Second, physicians and nurses in China were prepared and knowledgeable of influenza virus infections. Third, samples from patients with suspected influenza virus infections were collected and sent to the local and national centers for disease control and prevention promptly. H7N9 influenza A viruses were isolated and identified very quickly. Thereby, they were able to diagnose, confirm, and report three cases of H7N9 influenza patients in the early stage of the epidemic (24, 25) . Fourth, health care and public health workers were protected properly. Consequently, none of the health professionals was infected by H7N9 influenza A virus in 2013. However, a surgeon died of H7N9 influenza in Shanghai, China in January of 2014 (26) . Fifth, they detected H7N9 influenza A viruses from the samples of chickens, pigeons, and the environment of live poultry markets in Shanghai (27) ; and closed the live poultry markets of the involved epidemic region quickly. Sixth, patients were isolated and treated timely in hospitals, 74% (1251/1689) of those close contacts of H7N9 influenza patients were monitored and observed. Thus, H7N9 influenza A virus could not spread to a bigger population (24) . Last but not least, we are connected to the Internet now, and it seems that our planet is much smaller today than the earlier days when we did not have the Internet, because communication and information exchange have become so fast, easy, and convenient presently. During that avian influenza epidemic, some influenza experts in the world shared/exchanged H7N9 influenza A virus information and provided professional consultations and suggestions efficiently and rapidly. All these public health routine practices and measures resulted in that H7N9 influenza epidemic being controlled and stopped in China (24) . I have to point out that the cases of diagnosed H7N9 avian influenza A virus infection might only be the tip of the iceberg. Aside from one laboratory confirmed asymptotic case of H7N9 influenza A virus infection in Beijing (22), there were probably many undetected mild or asymptotic cases of influenza A H7N9 infection. The reason is that most people usually think a common cold is a very common and normal occurrence, and they don't take flu-like illnesses seriously. In most situations, they would just stay home and take some medicines. Only those who have very severe flu-like symptoms would see doctors, and thereby be detected and diagnosed, accordingly the real case fatality rate should be much lower than the detected 32.14% (45/140, one case from Taiwan, and one case from Hong Kong) (22, 23). Nowadays, we travel faster, and we travel more frequently and globally, and we have more complicated social activities and lifestyles, thereby increasing the chances of viral mutation; and we realize that influenza viruses are even easier to reassort, recombine, and mutate in nature than many other RNA viruses. However, we are now living in a technologically, economically, and socially much better and advanced society. I believe influenza virus infections are controllable and preventable, with the increased population health and immunity, with the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, and with standard/routine epidemiological practices, and with new effective anti-viral agents and vaccines in production in the future. Now, I first predict that influenza viruses will unlikely again cause a pandemic on a level comparable to what happened in 1918 and 1919. Hopefully, one day we could consider a strategy to produce a universal vaccine that can prevent people from infections of all influenza virus strains, or we could produce some very effective anti-influenza virus drugs; then influenza would not be a problem anymore. We should learn lessons from the mistakes we made in the past. It is reasonable and necessary to be cautious about influenza viruses, but overreactions or catastrophic reactions should be avoided in the future. My opinion is anti-traditional; the purpose of this article is to influence public health policy, and to save some of the limited resources and money for more important diseases like heart diseases, cancer, diabetes, AIDS, hepatitises, and tuberculosis (15) .

Inspired by the field of topological data analysis, we propose a novel approach to explore the robustness of road network connectivity in the presence of congestion on the roadway. The robustness of the pattern is summarized in a congestion barcode, which can be constructed directly from traffic datasets commonly used for navigation. As an initial demonstration, we illustrate the main technique on a publicly available traffic dataset in a neighborhood in New York City.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: We define a topology-based distance metric between road networks embedded in the plane. This distance measure is based on local persistent homology, and employs a local distance signature that enables identification and visualization of local differences between the road networks. This paper is motivated by the need to recognize changes in road networks over time and to assess the quality of different map construction algorithms. One particular challenge is evaluating the results when no ground truth is known. However, we demonstrate that we can overcome this hurdle by using a statistical technique known as the bootstrap.[2]: The brain network is usually constructed by estimating the connectivity matrix and thresholding it at an arbitrary level. The problem with this standard method is that we do not have any generally accepted criteria for determining a proper threshold. Thus, we propose a novel multiscale framework that models all brain networks generated over every possible threshold. Our approach is based on persistent homology and its various representations such as the Rips filtration, barcodes, and dendrograms. This new persistent homological framework enables us to quantify various persistent topological features at different scales in a coherent manner. The barcode is used to quantify and visualize the evolutionary changes of topological features such as the Betti numbers over different scales. By incorporating additional geometric information to the barcode, we obtain a single linkage dendrogram that shows the overall evolution of the network. The difference between the two networks is then measured by the Gromov-Hausdorff distance over the dendrograms. As an illustration, we modeled and differentiated the FDG-PET based functional brain networks of 24 attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder children, 26 autism spectrum disorder children, and 11 pediatric control subjects.[3]: We address the fundamental problem of goal-directed path planning in an uncertain environment represented as a probability (of occupancy) map. Most methods generally use a threshold to reduce the grayscale map to a binary map before applying off-the-shelf techniques to find the best path. This raises the somewhat ill-posed question, what is the right (optimal) value to threshold the map? We instead suggest a persistent homology approach to the problem-a topological approach in which we seek the homology class of trajectories that is most persistent for the given probability map. In other words, we want the class of trajectories that is free of obstacles over the largest range of threshold values. In order to make this problem tractable, we use homology in ℤ 2 coefficients (instead of the standard ℤ coefficients), and describe how graph search-based algorithms can be used to find trajectories in different homology classes. Our simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and practical applicability of the algorithm proposed in this paper.paper.","answer":"A variety of topological information can be studied.

Often it is assumed that the ratio of the associated hazards is a constant , rho , and we want adequate power for a given value of rho . In this case S(2)(t ) = S(rho)(1)(t ) , so that an assumption concerning S(1)(t ) is required . If a Kaplan-Meier estimate S(1)(t ) is available from a previous study , its use might be preferable to assuming a distribution of a particular form . In this note we show how such power calculations can be performed . Furthermore , since for any value of t , S(rho)(1)(t ) is a r and om variable , the variance of power estimates calculated using it can be estimatedTitle 2:Very Early Anthropometric Changes After Antiretroviral Therapy Predict Subsequent Survival, in Karonga, MalawiAbstract 2:Background : Antiretroviral ( ART )  scale-up in Malawi has been achieved on a large scale based mainly on clinical criteria . Simple markers of prognosis are useful , and we investigated the value of very early anthropometric changes in predicting mortality . Methods : Principal findings : Adult patients who initiated ART in Karonga District , northern Malawi , between September 2005 and August 2006 were included in a prospect i ve cohort study , and followed for up to one year . We used Cox regression to examine the association between anthropometric changes at 2 and 6 weeks and deaths within the first year . 573 patients were included , of whom 59 % were women ; the median age at initiation was 37 and 64 % were in WHO stage 4 . Both body mass index ( BMI ) and mid-upper arm circumference ( MUAC ) increased linearly with increased time on ART , and were closely correlated with each other . There were 118 deaths . After 2 weeks on ART , a BMI increase of < 0.5 kg/m2 ( HR 2.47 , 95%CI 1.24 - 4.94 , p=0.005 ) or a MUAC increase of < 0.5 cm ( HR 2.79 , 95%CI 1.19 - 6.55 , p=0.008 ) were strong predictors of death , and these associations were stronger after adjusting for baseline charactertistics . Similar results were found after 6 weeks on ART . Conclusions : Very early anthropometric changes , after 2 and 6 weeks on ART , are strong predictors of survival , independent of baseline characteristics . This should help identify patients requiring more detailed assessment where facilities are limited . MUAC is particularly valuable , requiring the simplest equipment and being appropriate for patients who have problems st and ingTitle 3:Effect of Probiotic Bacteria on Microbial Host Defense, Growth, and Immune Function in Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type-1 InfectionAbstract 3:The hypothesis that probiotic administration protects the gut surface and could delay progression of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type1 ( HIV-1 ) infection to the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) was proposed in 1995 . Over the last five years , new studies have clarified the significance of HIV-1 infection of the gut associated lymphoid tissue ( GALT ) for subsequent alterations in the microflora and breakdown of the gut mucosal barrier leading to pathogenesis and development of AIDS . Current studies show that loss of gut CD4 + Th17 cells , which differentiate in response to normal microflora , occurs early in HIV-1 disease . Microbial translocation and suppression of the T regulatory ( Treg ) cell response is associated with chronic immune activation and inflammation . Combinations of probiotic bacteria which upregulate Treg activation have shown promise in suppressing pro inflammatory immune response in models of autoimmunity including inflammatory bowel disease and provide a rationale for use of probiotics in HIV-1/AIDS . Disturbance of the microbiota early in HIV-1 infection leads to greater dominance of potential pathogens , reducing levels of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus species and increasing mucosal inflammation . The interaction of chronic or recurrent infections , and immune activation contributes to nutritional deficiencies that have lasting consequences especially in the HIV-1 infected child . While effective anti-retroviral therapy ( ART ) has enhanced survival , wasting is still an independent predictor of survival and a major presenting symptom . Congenital exposure to HIV-1 is a risk factor for growth delay in both infected and non-infected infants . Nutritional intervention after 6 months of age appears to be largely ineffective . A meta analysis of r and omized , controlled clinical trials of infant formulae supplemented with Bifidobacterium lactis showed that weight gain was significantly greater in infants who received B. lactis compared to formula alone . Pilot studies have shown that probiotic bacteria given as a supplement have improved growth and protected against loss of CD4 + T cells . The recognition that normal bacterial flora prime neonatal immune response and that abnormal flora have a profound impact on metabolism has generated insight into potential mechanisms of gut dysfunction in many setting s including HIV-1 infection . As discussed here , current and emerging studies support the concept that probiotic bacteria can provide specific benefit in HIV-1 infection . Probiotic bacteria have proven active against bacterial vaginosis in HIV-1 positive women and have enhanced growth in infants with congenital HIV-1 infection . Probiotic bacteria may stabilize CD4 + T cell numbers in HIV-1 infected children and are likely to have protective effects against inflammation and chronic immune activation of the gastrointestinal immune systemTitle 4:Comparison of methods for assessing nutritional status in HIV-infected adults.Abstract 4:Malnutrition is a frequent complication of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection and is associated with a poor prognosis . To compare different measures of nutritional status in HIV-infected patients , we prospect ively studied 88 out patients seen at a Paris AIDS outpatient clinic for routine follow-up examinations .  Nutritional status was assessed according to  body weight loss ( BWL , 4 classes ) , anthropometry , bioelectric impedance analysis ( BIA ) , and subjective global assessment of nutritional status ( SGA ) . Malnutrition was diagnosed in 22.4 % of subjects using SGA , and 37.1 % by BWL . SGA rapidly detected a worsening of nutritional status , while BWL detected malnutrition at an earlier stage . A good correlation was found between SGA class and body composition assessed by anthropometry and BIA . Deteriorating nutritional status diagnosed by SGA correlated with the CDC HIV disease class . SGA , a simple nutritional assessment , can serve as a basis for prescribing artificial nutrition , while BWL detects malnutrition at an earlier stageTitle 5:Weight and body shape changes in a treatment-naive population after 6 months of nevirapine-based generic highly active antiretroviral therapy in South India.Abstract 5:BACKGROUND The nutritional and body shape response after the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) in re source -limited environments has not been documented . In this environment , nutritional compromise is a common complication of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . METHODS We conducted a prospect i ve study of 190 HIV-infected patients who initiated a nevirapine-based HAART regimen .  CD4 + T cell count , body weight , body mass index , anthropometry , and bioelectrical impedance data were collected prior to initiation of therapy and after 6 months of therapy . RESULTS The mean age of participants was 35 years , 85 % of participants were male , and 59 % received  stavudine  as 1 of the nucleosides in their initial HAART regimen . The members of the cohort were malnourished before the initiation of therapy and had a mean body mass index of 20.1 ( calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters ) . Overall , body weight increased a mean of 2.8 kg ( range , -12.5 to 22.5 kg ) , and CD4 + T cell counts increased by a mean of 140 cells/mm3 . Patients were stratified into those who lost weight ( loss of > 1 kg , 22 % ; n=41 ) , those whose weight remained stable ( 19 % ; n=37 ) , and those who gained weight ( gain of > 1 kg , 59 % ; n=112 ) . Patients in all groups retained body shape symmetry and experienced no change in waist-to-hip ratio or regional body shape by anthropometry . CONCLUSIONS The group that lost weight and the group whose weight remained stable experienced significant CD4 + T cell count increases at 6 months . Although the majority of HIV-infected patients who received nevirapine-based HAART gained weight , there were participants who lost weight despite initiating their first HAART therapyTitle 6:Severe hepatotoxicity associated with nevirapine use in HIV-infected subjects.Abstract 6:Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected South African patients ( n=468 ) received blinded lamivudine or emtricitabine , stavudine , and either nevirapine or efavirenz ( based on screening viral load ) . Baseline characteristics were analyzed in univariate and multivariate regression , to identify risk factors for hepatotoxicity ( grade 3 or greater increase in serum aminotransferase levels ) . The occurrence of early hepatotoxicity was 17 % in the nevirapine group and 0 % in the efavirenz group and was balanced between the lamivudine and emtricitabine arms . Two subjects died of hepatic failure . Independent risk factors were body-mass index ( BMI ) < 18.5 , female sex , serum albumin level < 35 g/L , mean corpuscular volume > 85 fL , plasma HIV-1 RNA load < 20,000 copies/mL , aspartate aminotransferase level < 75 IU/L , and lactate dehydrogenase level < 164 IU/L. The use of nevirapine in female patients with a low BMI should be discouraged","answer":"Conclusion Undernutrition and weight loss are prevalent amongst highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-treated patients in LMICs and contribute to excess early mortality ."},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper. Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: While early attempts to directly cause increases in permeability of endothelial monolayers with viral particles or viral infection were largely disappointing, hantaviruses have been identified as adversely affecting endothelial migration over substrata  and in potentiating VEG-F-induced endothelial permeability [47, 48] . The shorter (50-kD) nucleocapsid or N protein is a structural component of the viral nucleocapsid, along with the genomic viral RNA segments. As an RNA-binding protein that engages the hairpin termini of the genomic segments with high affinity [49, 50] , it limits the access of the RNA to host nucleases and helps to render viral replication a closed process within the cytoplasm. It also acts as a peripheral membrane protein, as does the L protein [51] , an activity that could play a role in its presumed, but not yet demonstrated function as matrix [52] . Until recently, it had not been appreciated that N has a wide variety of other activities, some of which can be linked, not only to fundamental requirements of replication, but also to the interference with an array of the intracellular processes of the normal cell. Thus, an interaction between the amino terminus of the hantavirus N protein and the cellular protein Daxx has been proposed, with the suggestion of potential pro-apoptotic consequences [51] . N is also reported to interact with actin microfilaments, and the SUMO-1 protein [53, 54] . Using reporter-gene based assays, Connie Schmaljohn and her colleagues have reported that Hantaan virus' nucleocapsid protein has an inhibitory role in inflammatory responses mediated by NF kappa B (NF-B). The effects on NF-B expression appeared to be confined to prevention of its nuclear translocation after its attempted activation with lipopolysaccharide, LPS [55] . In the cytoplasm of infected cells, N protein can be found in cellular P bodies where it sequesters and protects 5' caps. It may locate the caps through its interaction with DCP1, a key constituent of P bodies. During hantavirus infection, the viral RNAs become concentrated in P bodies, through their interaction with N and DCP1. The N protein demonstrates preferential protection of mRNAs engineered to prematurely terminate their encoded protein in comparison to native mRNAs [56] . N protein has been increasingly linked to viral replication and translation, sometimes in previously unanticipated ways. It is among a growing family of diverse viral proteins that can serve as a nonspecific -RNA chaperone‖, an activity that should facilitate the L polymerase's access to vRNA for transcription and replication, in that it can transiently dissociate misfolded RNA structures [57] . Some of N protein's effects on translation might not immediately be recognized to be adaptive in nature. It can replace the entire EIF4F translational initiation complex, simultaneously presenting the ribosome with a replacement for the cap-binding activity of eIF 4E, binding to the 43S pre-initiation complex as does eIF 4G, while replacing the helicase activity of eIF 4A, which is presumed to be needed to dissociate higher-order RNA structure [56, 58] . These three factors normally work together to achieve translational initiation. In P bodies, N protein's ability to bind at high affinity to capped native cellular oligoribonucleotides, along with its activity in protecting capped RNAs from degradation likely facilitates the access of capped oligonucleotides for use in transcriptional initiation by L polymerase (-cap snatching‖). Trafficking of N for viral assembly: Classically, N protein in infected cells appears to be clustered or particulate in nature, with a heavy concentration at a single perinuclear location, widely considered to be the Golgi [27] . The N proteins of hantaviruses are found in association with particulate fractions, and confocal microscopy and biochemical-inhibitor studies have shown that N tracks along microtubules but not with actin filaments [52] . The ultimate destination for N, for its assembly into viral particles is the Golgi, and it traffics there via the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate complex (ERGIC), also known as vesicular-tubular cluster [52] . A dominant negative inhibitor, dynamitin, associated with dynein-mediated transport, reduced N's accumulation in the Golgi. Later studies suggested that the specific dependence on microtubular transport is specific to Old World hantaviruses such as HTNV, but that the New World hantavirus ANDV is instead associated with actin filaments [59] . However, recent data indicates that microtubular transport is indeed utilized for the New World hantavirus SNV [60] . Hantavirus diseases of man have long been suspected of having an immunopathogenic basis in part because of their relatively long incubation period of 2-3 weeks and the observed temporal association between immunologic derangements and the first appearance of signs and symptoms of hantavirus illness. HFRS and HCPS share many clinical features, leading many investigators to consider them to be, in essence, different manifestations of a similar pathogenic process, differing mainly in the primary target organs of disease expression ( Table 2 ). The pathogenesis of hantavirus infections is the topic of a continuously-updated review in the series UpToDate [61] . By the time symptoms appear in HCPS, both strong antiviral responses, and, for the more virulent viral genotypes, viral RNA can be detected in blood plasma or nucleated blood cells respectively [63, 64] . At least three studies have correlated plasma viral RNA with disease severity for HCPS and HFRS, suggesting that the replication of the virus plays an ongoing and real-time role in viral pathogenesis [65] [66] [67] . Several hallmark pathologic changes have been identified that occur in both HFRS and HCPS. A critical feature of both is a transient (~ 1-5 days) capillary leak involving the kidney and retroperitoneal space in HFRS and the lungs in HCPS. The resulting leakage is exudative in character, with chemical composition high in protein and resembling plasma. The continued experience indicating the strong tissue tropism for endothelial cells, specifically, is among the several factors that make β3 integrin an especially attractive candidate as an important in vivo receptor for hantaviruses. It is likely that hantaviruses arrive at their target tissues through uptake by regional lymph nodes, perhaps with or within an escorting lung histiocyte. The virus seeds local endothelium, where the first few infected cells give rise, ultimately, to a primary viremia, a process that appears to take a long time for hantavirus infections [62, 63] . By the time that secondary viremia emerges, the agents of the more severe forms of HFRS and HCPS have begun to achieve sufficient mass as to induce, through PAMP-PRR interactions and other means, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines [64] . For HCPS, that expression favors the pulmonary bed and lymphoid organs, yet, for unknown reasons, spares the retroperitoneum and, in general, the kidney. In HFRS the situation is reversed, and yet it is often not appreciated that the expected preferential tissue tropism of HFRS-associated viruses and their HCPS-associated counterparts for the renal and pulmonary beds, respectively, is not as one would predict through the manifestations of the two diseases. Local elaboration of inflammatory and chemotactic mediators is considered to be a requirement for the development of systemic disease symptoms, with those abnormalities sometimes culminating in shock and death. Yet it is not hypoxemia, due to the prominent pulmonary edema, that leads to death in most fatal cases of HCPS, but rather intoxication of the heart by as-yet-undefined mediators that leads to the low cardiac output state and the associated shock syndrome [64, 65] . It is tempting to speculate that mediators produced in the lung in connection with the inflammatory infiltrate can percolate through the coronary circulation with minimal dilution in HCPS, a disadvantageous consequence of the close anatomic juxtaposition of the two organs. Thus, at least three classes of potential mechanisms, some overlapping and all certainly nonexclusive of the others, could be presumed to underlie the pathogenesis of HCPS. These include:(1) Innate immune mechanisms. The nature of interactions between hantavirus pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) with the pattern recognition receptors (PRR) of susceptible endothelial cells are beginning to be clarified. The prototypical HTNV appears to be recognized by TLR-3 [43] . Such an infection has consequences such as increased expression of HLA-DR in dendritic cells [66] and differentiation of monocytes toward dendritic cells [67] . (2) Direct viral effects. The observed correlation between viral load and disease severity leaves the possibility open that hantavirus particles or RNA can themselves have toxic effects on cells or on signaling. Some investigators have favored direct viral toxicity, acting through the inhibition of endothelial cell barrier function, as an explanation for much of the capillary leak, although there is widespread agreement that multiple mechanisms that mediate pathogenesis likely operate simultaneously in the affected patient [68] . A potentially important clue toward the mechanism by which hantavirus infections deplete blood platelets and, in some cases cause hemorrhagic manifestations, was advanced by the recent discovery that pathogenic hantaviruses are able to recruit platelets to adhere to endothelial cell surfaces, with β3 integrin used as a critical binding element [69] . (3) Pathogenic effects caused by the activities of specific viral macromolecules. We have reviewed some of the activities associated with the Gn, Gc and N, virally-encoded polypeptides in previous sections. Testing models of pathogenesis can be done more effectively when there is an animal model that mimics key aspects of the disease. There is no such model that closely mimics HFRS, but animal models exist for both the asymptomatic carriage of PUUV and SNV by their native carrier rodents, the bank vole Myodes glareolus and the deer mouse P. maniculatus; as well as a Syrian hamster model using ANDV or the related Maporal virus from Venezuela, for which an HCPS-mimetic disease is observed [70] [71] [72] [73] . The ANDV-Syrian hamster model has a number of features in common with the human disease, as well as some differences. Unlike the neurologic diseases that have been possible to elicit with HTNV, the hamster model for HCPS appears to be caused by capillary leak that results in pulmonary edema and the production of a pleural effusion with exudative characteristics. Typically the hamsters die between 11 and 14-d post-inoculation, reflecting a slightly accelerated incubation period in comparison to human infections. As with human HCPS, the microscopic examination of the lung reveals abundant fibrin deposition, thickened alveolar septa, and viral antigen expressed abundantly in the microvascular endothelium. ANDV-infected hamsters fitted with physiologic monitoring devices exhibited diminished pulse pressures, tachycardia, and hypotension that appear to closely mimic the shock that is believed to be the proximate cause of demise in patients who succumb to HCPS [65, 74] . Compared to the human disease, ANDV-infected hamsters exhibit exceptionally high titers of live ANDV in their tissues, with much of the viral replication occurring in hepatocytes, which are spared in the human disease. Titers of live ANDV in some cases exceed 10 8 /g, whereas hantavirus isolates from human tissues have been notoriously difficult to obtain. Despite the universal occurrence of mildly-elevated hepatic enzymes in patients with HCPS, hepatic enzymes do not appear to be present at elevated levels in the blood of diseased hamsters even immediately before death [75] . The protracted incubation period associated with hantavirus disease gives the host considerable time to mount a mature immune response against the virus. Thus, in contradistinction to infections of comparable severity and related symptomatology associated with arenaviruses and filoviruses, hantavirus infections of humans are associated with antibody responses of significant titer by the time symptoms commence. Despite this observation, it appears to be possible that natural variation in individual neutralizing antibody responses among patients with SNV infections can be linked to disease severity, suggesting that administration of antiviral antibodies could prove effective therapeutically [76] . In the case of ANDV infection, new evidence has emerged indicating that the apparent clearance of the virus from the blood does not result in the complete removal of antigenic stimulus by the virus, suggesting that the virus may persist, perhaps in some as-yet undetermined immunologically privileged site [77] . A role for T cell-mediated pathological responses in HFRS and HCPS has been the source of speculation for a variety of reasons. The severity of SNV-associated HCPS may have made it more apparent that the onset of pulmonary edema, tachycardia and hypertension seemed to be all but universally temporally associated with the appearance of a spectrum of highly-activated cells of the lymphoid lineage in the peripheral blood. Cells with a close morphologic similarity to these -immunoblasts‖ were detected in the congested, heavy lungs of patients who came to autopsy, as well as in lymphoid organs and in the portal triads [63, [78] [79] [80] . These observations led to speculation that some component of hantavirus pathogenesis could be linked to the appearance of antiviral T cells that could stimulate or contribute to the appearance of a -storm‖ of mediators and the associated capillary leak phenotype. Subsequent studies have borne out the expectation that a significant fraction of the immunoblast population in patients with HCPS are T cells with specificity for specific class I HLA-presented epitopes of viral antigens, including Gn, Gc and N [77, [81] [82] [83] . Presumably, the antiviral activities of such cells, manifested in part through their elaboration of mediators in the affected interstitium, can contribute to the endothelial/capillary leak that lies at the heart of hantavirus pathogenesis. Because early cases of HCPS often came to autopsy, it became possible to examine necropsied tissues for expression of cytokines. The study by Mori et al. (1999) revealed high relative expression of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF, IL-1, IL-6, providing evidence in favor of a -cytokine storm‖ model for pathogenesis [64] . The authors believed, based on the morphology of cytokine-secreting cells, that both monocytes and lymphocytes were contributing to the production of cytokines. That proinflammatory mediators are found in elevated levels in the plasma as well as the renal interstitium of patients with acute hantaviral illness has been recognized for some time as well [84, 85] .Question: What have hantaviruses been identified as adversely affect?","answer":"endothelial migration over substrata"},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

The two apo-proteins were taken as model systems for ferritin internal cavity accessibility in that Af-Ft is characterized by the presence of a 45Å wide aperture on the protein surface whereas Pf-Ft displays canonical (threefold) channels. Thiol reactivity has been probed in kinetic experiments in order to assess the protein matrix permeation properties towards the bulky thiol reactive DTNB (5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid) molecule. Reaction of DTNB with thiols was observed in all ferritin mutants, including those bearing free cysteine thiols inside the ferritin cavity. As expected, a ferritin mutant from Pf-Ft, in which the cysteine thiol is on the outer surface displays the fastest binding kinetics. In turn, also the Pf-Ft mutant in which the cysteine thiol is placed within the internal cavity, is still capable of full stoichiometric DTNB binding albeit with an almost 200- fold slower rate. The behaviour of Af-Ft bearing a cysteine thiol in a topological ly equivalent position in the internal cavity was intermediate among the two Pf-Ft mutants. The data thus obtained indicate clearly that the protein matrix in archaea ferritins does not provide a significant barrier against bulky, negatively charged ligand s such as DTNB, a finding of relevance in view of the multiple biotechnological applications of these ferritins that envisage ligand encapsulation within the internal cavity.","answer":"{\\"AnatomicalStructure\\": [\\"cavity\\"], \\"Bacterium\\": [], \\"BiologicFunction\\": [\\"binding\\"], \\"BiomedicalOccupationOrDiscipline\\": [\\"topological\\", \\"biotechnological\\"], \\"BodySubstance\\": [\\"matrix\\"], \\"BodySystem\\": [], \\"Chemical\\": [\\"ferritins\\", \\"cysteine thiol\\", \\"5,5u0027-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid\\", \\"protein\\", \\"archaea ferritins\\", \\"archaeal ferritins\\", \\"mutants\\", \\"canonical (threefold) channels\\", \\"DTNB\\", \\"thiol\\", \\"bulky\\", \\"ligand\\", \\"ferritin\\", \\"cysteine thiols\\", \\"apo-proteins\\", \\"thiols\\", \\"mutant\\", \\"Thiol\\"], \\"ClinicalAttribute\\": [], \\"Eukaryote\\": [], \\"Finding\\": [\\"negatively charged\\", \\"finding\\", \\"aperture\\", \\"capable\\", \\"presence\\", \\"barrier\\"], \\"Food\\": [], \\"HealthCareActivity\\": [\\"Probing\\", \\"probed\\"], \\"InjuryOrPoisoning\\": [], \\"IntellectualProduct\\": [], \\"MedicalDevice\\": [], \\"Organization\\": [], \\"PopulationGroup\\": [], \\"ProfessionalOrOccupationalGroup\\": [], \\"ResearchActivity\\": [\\"engineered\\", \\"experiments\\"], \\"SpatialConcept\\": [\\"position\\", \\"intermediate\\", \\"positions\\", \\"internal\\", \\"surface\\"], \\"Virus\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

The prevalence of CpG substitutions is due to their mutational origin, which is dependent on DNA methylation. In comparison, other single nucleotide substitutions( for example those occurring at GpC dinucleotides) mainly arise from errors during DNA replication. Here we analyzed high quality BAC-based data from human, chimpanzee, and baboon to investigate regional variation of CpG substitution rates. We show that CpG substitutions occur approximately 15 times more frequently than other single nucleotide substitutions in primate genomes, and that they exhibit substantial regional variation. Patterns of CpG rate variation are consistent with differences in methylation level and susceptibility to subsequent deamination. In particular, we propose a “distance-decaying” hypothesis, positing that due to the molecular mechanism of a CpG substitution, rates are correlated with the stability of double-stranded DNA surrounding each CpG dinucleotide, and the effect of local DNA stability may decrease with distance from the CpG dinucleotide. Consistent with our “distance-decaying” hypothesis, rates of CpG substitution are strongly( negatively) correlated with regional G+C content. The influence of G+C content decays as the distance from the target CpG site increases. We estimate that the influence of local G+C content extends up to 1, 500∼2, 000 bps centered on each CpG site. We also show that the distance-decaying relationship persisted when we controlled for the effect of long-range homogeneity of nucleotide composition. GpC sites, in contrast, do not exhibit such “distance-decaying” relationship. Our results highlight an example of the distinctive properties of methylation-dependent substitutions versus substitutions mostly arising from errors during DNA replication. Furthermore, the negative relationship between G+C content and CpG rates may provide an explanation for the observation that GC-rich SINEs show lower CpG rates than other repetitive elements.Introduction:Elucidating causes of regional variation of substitution rates is a prominent topic in molecular evolutionary studies[1]–[6]. While most studies consider all types of point mutations together, different types of mutations arise from distinctive molecular processes. In this paper, we contrasted regional variations of two types of mutations that are prevalent in mammalian genomes according to their molecular origins. The first type of point mutations we consider are transitions at CpG dinucleotides, which are caused primarily by methylation of cytosine[7],[8]. Methylation followed by deamination causes a C to T transition( or G to A transition in the complementary strand) at a CpG dinucleotide. We refer to C to T( or G to A) substitutions at a CpG site as “CpG substitutions”. These are the most frequent point mutation in the human genome[2],[9], and often the basis of human genetic disease[10],[11]. In contrast, most other point mutations are believed to occur from errors in DNA replication[12]. Here we show that CpG substitutions occur over one order of magnitude more frequently than other substitutions in primate genomes, and that they exhibit substantial regional variability. We investigated the causes of regional variability of CpG rates. We pay a particular attention to the role of regional sequence context, based upon the differences in mutational mechanisms. In particular, efficiency of the deamination step may affect regional variation of CpG substitutions[13]. A prerequisite for the deamination process is the insertion of a water molecule between the DNA strands, via temporary melting or strand separation, which requires thermodynamic energy[13]–[15]. Bonds between G and C nucleotides require more thermodynamic energy to break, compared with A and T nucleotides[16]. Therefore, the substitution rate at CpG dinucleotides may be negatively correlated with GC content( defined as the percentage of G and C nucleotides). There are conflicting conclusions on this relationship[17]–[19]. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the G+C content of the whole sequence segment affects the probability of a CpG site to mutate. Rather, the effect of G+C content on CpG substitution may be confined to sites that are nearby the CpG site. In other words, the effect of sequence context on a CpG substitution is likely to be local. Moreover, we predict this effect will decay as the distance to the target CpG site increases. Therefore, we predict that G+C content has a strong distance-decaying influence on the CpG substitution rate, because only local DNA melting is required for deamination to occur. We present evidence that is consistent with our distance-decaying local GC influence hypothesis. In addition to our main results on the distance-decaying relationship, we discuss other causative factors of regional heterogeneity of CpG substitution rates. These include differential methylation of some transposable elements and potential variation of mismatch repair efficiency. The factors causing regional CpG substitution rate variation outlined in this paper are important in the study of genome evolution, and in the inference of phylogenetic histories. Our work also highlights the distinct properties of mutations that are dependent on DNA methylation as opposed to those mainly caused by errors during replication.Discussion:Even though the prevalence and importance of CpG substitutions is long recognized[8], the causes and patterns of their regional variation have been relatively little explored. In this study, we analyzed a large amount of high-quality genome sequence data( based upon BAC-clones) to provide a better understanding on the patterns and causes of variation of CpG substitution rates in primate genomes. The negative relationship between CpG substitution rate and G+C content is consistent with the idea that variations in the efficiency of the deamination process[13]–[15],[17] cause regional variation of CpG substitution rates. On the other hand, biased gene conversion can also explain this relationship. Even though we cannot distinguish the relative contributions of these two processes by our analysis, the distance-decaying relationship between G+C content and CpG substitution rate strengthens the former hypothesis. Our distance-decaying hypothesis is contradictory to conclusions drawn by Fryxell and Moon[17] and Zhao and Jiang[25]. Fryxell and Moon[17] conclude that G+C content of short and long segments surrounding each CpG site has similar degrees of correlations with the rate of CpG substitutions; this is clearly counter to the distance-decaying influence hypothesis. However, their analysis was based on a considerably smaller dataset( a total of 4437 CpG and GpC sites, as compared to 497467 sites used in this study; see Table 1), and only two length scales( 564 bps and 163 kb) were analyzed. In another study, Zhao and Jiang[25] analyzed a larger human SNP dataset( 292216 CpG and GpC sites) and observed that the absolute value of the slope of the relationship between log( CpG substitution rate) and G+C content increased with the length over which G+C content was measured( segment lengths of 101 bps to 1, 001 bps around the CpG site). Their results are counter to the thermodynamic mechanisms which were first suggested by Fryxell and Zuckerkandl[13] and now drive our hypothesis. The discrepancy is likely due to the different method and dataset used by Zhao and Jiang[25], as compared to our study( see Text S1 for details). Our results in this vein support the thermodynamic mechanism. Our analyses( Figure 3 and Figure 4) show that the CpG substitution rate has a significantly stronger relationship with the local G+C content. The influence of the G+C content decays with the distance to the target CpG site, subsiding at around 1, 500–2, 000 bps for each direction. There are at least two immediate questions raised by our analysis. First, what are the causes of the local distance-decaying relationship, which extends up to 1, 500–2, 000 bps? Given the absence of evidence for the effect of transcription coupled repair or transcription induced deamination( only intergenic regions were analyzed), or change in mutational biases over time[9], we propose that the distance-decaying relationship may be a consequence of the poorly understood mechanism of DNA melting[35], which is required for the deamination process. The second question is whether there is both global and local effect of G+C content on CpG substitution rate. We raise this question because it is possible that only the local G+C content may affect the CpG substitution rate, and the global effect is a consequence of the so-called “isochore” structure, which causes a positive correlation between local G+C content and global G+C content[31],[36],[37]. Although the answer to this question is still unclear and more direct experiments are required, the convergence of CpG curves when the data is divided into low-GCglobal and high-GCglobal distributions( For example, Figure S2A and S2B) despite the fact that there is some variation in GCglobal even within these distributions( Figure S1A) suggests that GCglobal may not have a direct effect on the rate of CpG substitution. We found a negative relationship between GpC substitution rate and G+C content( Figure 2B). As suggested by Fryxell and Moon[17], this relationship can be explained by biased gene conversion[38] or by regional differences in the deamination of unmethylated cytosines( an underlying mutational bias). In the absence of a distance-decaying relationship between GpC substitution rate and local G+C content( Figure 3A and Figure 4A), which is expected if deamination plays a major role in causing GpC substitution rate variation, it seems more likely that biased gene conversion is the cause of the negative relationship between G+C content and GpC substitution rate. Our results demonstrate the significance of the distinctive properties exhibited by methylation dependent substitutions versus substitutions caused by other molecular mechanisms. Models of molecular evolution and methods of phylogenetic inference, especially those concerned with mammalian and bird genomes( which have high rates of CpG substitutions), may benefit by considering the local effect of G+C content on CpG substitution rates( e. g.,[5],[18],[30]).","answer":"Mutations are raw materials of evolution .

Das et al., 2018; Thomason et al., 2019) empower large-scale learning of natural language grounded navigation that is situated in photorealistic simulation environments.Nevertheless, the generalization problem commonly exists for these tasks, especially indoor navigation: the agent usually performs poorly on unknown environments that have never been seen during training.One of the main causes for such behavior is data scarcity as it is expensive and time-consuming to extend either visual environments or natural language guidance.The number of scanned houses for indoor navigation is limited due to high expense and privacy concerns.Besides, unlike vision-only navigation tasks (Mirowski et al., 2018; Xia et al., 2018; Manolis Savva* et al., 2019; Kolve et al., 2017) where episodes can be exhaustively sampled in simulation, natural language grounded navigation is supported by human demonstrated interaction and communication in natural language.It is impractical to fully collect and cover all the samples for individual tasks.Therefore, it is essential though challenging to efficiently learn a more generalized policy for natural language grounded navigation tasks from existing data (Wu et al., 2018a; b) .In this paper, we study how to resolve the generalization and data scarcity issues from two different angles.First, previous methods are trained for one task at the time, so each new task requires training a brand new agent instance that can only solve the one task it was trained on.In this work, we propose a generalized multitask model for natural language grounded navigation tasks such as Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) and Navigation from Dialog History (NDH), aiming at efficiently transferring knowledge across tasks and effectively solving both tasks with one agent simultaneously.Moreover, although there are thousands of trajectories paired with language guidance, the underlying house scans are restricted.For instance, the popular Matterport3D dataset (Chang et al., 2017) contains only 61 unique house scans in the training set.The current models perform much better in seen environments by taking advantage of the knowledge of specific houses they have acquired over multiple task completions during training, but fail to generalize to houses not seen during training.Hence we propose an environment-agnostic learning method to learn a visual representation that is invariant to specific environments but still able to support navigation.Endowed with the learned environment-agnostic representations, the agent is further prevented from the overfitting issue and generalizes better on unseen environments.To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce natural language grounded multitask and environment-agnostic training regimes and validate their effectiveness on VLN and NDH tasks.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our environment-agnostic multitask navigation model can not only efficiently execute different language guidance in indoor environments but also outperform the single-task baseline models by a large margin on both tasks.Besides, the performance gap between seen and unseen environments is significantly reduced.We also set a new state of the art on NDH with over 120% improvement in terms of goal progress.In this work, we show that the model trained using environment-agnostic multitask learning approach learns a generalized policy for the two natural language grounded navigation tasks.It closes down the gap between seen and unseen environments, learns more generalized environment representations and effectively transfers knowledge across tasks outperforming baselines on both the tasks simultaneously by a significant margin.At the same time, the two approaches independently benefit the agent learning and are complementary to each other.There are possible future extensions to our work-the MT-RCM can further be adapted to other language-grounded navigation datasets, such as those using Street View (e.g., Touchdown (Chen et al., 2019) Table 6 presents a more detailed ablation of Table 5 using different parts of dialog history.The results prove that agents rewarded for getting closer to the goal room consistently outperform agents rewarded for getting closer to the exact goal location.Table 7 presents a more detailed analysis from Table 3 with access to different parts of dialog history.The models with shared language encoder consistently outperform those with separate encoders.Figure 4: Visualizing performance gap between seen and unseen environments for VLN and NDH tasks.For VLN, the plotted metric is agent's success rate while for NDH, the metric is agent's progress.","answer":"We propose to learn a more generalized policy for natural language grounded navigation tasks via environment-agnostic multitask learning."},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

Currently available functional and structural data suggest that TRPV1 channels have two gates within their permeation pathway: one formed by a ′bundle-crossing′ at the intracellular entrance and a second constriction at the selectivity filter. To describe conformational changes associated with channel gating, the fluorescent non-canonical amino acid coumarin-tyrosine was genetically encoded at Y671, a residue proximal to the selectivity filter. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy was performed to image the conformational dynamics of the channels in live cells. Photon counts and optical fluctuations from coumarin encoded within TRPV1 tetramers correlates with channel activation by capsaicin, providing an optical marker of conformational dynamics at the selectivity filter. In agreement with the fluorescence data, molecular dynamics simulations display alternating solvent exposure of Y671 in the closed and open states. Overall, the data point to a dynamic selectivity filter that may serve as a gate for permeation.Introduction:Cation channels from the TRPV family are functional tetramers with a central pore domain that is shaped by TM5 and TM6 transmembrane segments from each of the four subunits( Ramsey et al., 2006)( Figure 1a). As in Shaker-related tetrameric ion channels, the pore domain houses the ion selectivity filter and an intracellular ‘bundle crossing’ formed by the α-helical S6 segments. Functional and structural data suggest that the selectivity filter and inner bundle crossing have the potential to control the flux of ions according to the electrochemical gradient( Cao et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2016; Salazar et al., 2009). The lower constriction is highly conserved( Palovcak et al., 2015) and associated to the canonical gate( Cao et al., 2013; Steinberg et al., 2014), but less is known about the putative role of the upper constriction at the ionic selectivity filter, possibly due to the functionally sensitive nature of this region to side-chain mutagenesis. Nevertheless, high-resolution structures of TRPV1 suggest that the upper constriction undergoes structural changes in the presence of DkTx( Gao et al., 2016), a spider toxin that increases the open probability of the channel( Siemens et al., 2006). Moreover, the inhibition of the unitary conductance of TRPV1 channels by protons suggests that the selectivity filter region is flexible and is capable of adopting multiple, functionally distinct conformational states( Liu et al., 2009; Wen et al., 2016). However, it is not known if such conformational dynamics at the selectivity filter might be coupled to channel activation by agonists, such as capsaicin, and if filter gating is sufficient or acts in concert with the lower bundle crossing to control the ionic conductance. Organic dyes with environmentally sensitive fluorescence have been used for nearly 20 years to describe membrane protein conformational changes and ion channel motions( Mannuzzu et al., 1996). The voltage-clamp fluorometry( VCF) approach relies on the covalent attachment of such fluorophores, usually via introduced cysteine residues, and allows for the simultaneous recording of fluorescence signals and voltage-clamped ionic currents from expressed ion channels, often in the Xenopus oocyte( Cha and Bezanilla, 1997). This technique has proven to be useful for the real-time description of subtle, and in some cases electrophysiologically silent, conformational changes in voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels( Cha et al., 1999; Islas and Zagotta, 2006; Pless and Lynch, 2009). However, excessive background labeling of intracellular sites, at endogenous cysteine residues for instance, and the prerequisite for solvent accessibility of the labeling site serve to limit the utility of the technique substantially for the study of intracellular or solvent-restricted residues. A possible solution to these limitations is the use of genetically encoded fluorophores in the form of non-canonical amino acids( f-ncAA)( Drabkin et al., 1996). Such strategies employ an orthogonal suppressor tRNA and an evolved tRNA synthetase( RS), which can be used to encode the ncAA at any site in the reading frame of the target gene( Drabkin et al., 1996; Sakamoto et al., 2002). This approach has been used for site-specific incorporation of fluorescent ncAAs on soluble proteins in prokaryotic systems( Summerer et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2006), membrane proteins expressed in Xenopus oocytes( Kalstrup and Blunck, 2013;), and proteins expressed in mammalian cells( Chatterjee et al., 2013; Luo et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2011; Steinberg et al., 2016; Zagotta et al., 2016). The f-ncAA coumarin has potential for the study of expressed protein conformational dynamics because of its small size and its exquisite sensitivity to environmental polarity( Liu et al., 2015; Wagner, 2009; Wang et al., 2006). This sensitivity can be exploited to report on variations( i. e. dielectric changes) in the surroundings of the incorporated f-ncAA and, in turn, it can be interpreted as a signature of a protein conformational change. Notable examples include the use of coumarin and the amber codon suppression technique to report on peptide binding to viral proteins( Ugwumba et al., 2011), on the photoregulation of firefly luciferase and on the subcellular localization of proteins in living mammalian cells( Luo et al., 2014), as well as onstructural rearrangements in isolated NaK channels( Liu et al., 2015). Here, the spectral dynamics of an encoded hydroxy-coumarin were determined in individual live cells with total internal reflection( TIRF) microscopy and rapid imaging of single emitters to study the conformational changes occurring within the pore of the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 during activation.Discussion:Ion channel gating occurs in the range of hundreds of µs and it is one of the fastest protein-dependent processes occurring within cells( Hille, 2001). This rapid time-frame imposes intrinsic technical barriers in the detection of a limited number of photons coming from few emitting molecules and a consequent low signal-to-noise ratio under these conditions( Ha, 2014). Given the design of our imaging setups and our experimental conditions( i. e. transient overexpression), we are bound to either the low( 64 × 32 pixel) spatial resolution of the ns-time-scale sampling of the SPAD imager( which does not allow us to discriminate single emitters) or to a low signal-to-noise ratio restricting us to image at a maximum of 500 Hz( ms-time scale) for the individual diffraction-limited spots observed by an EM-CCD camera. As reported previously( Blunck et al., 2008), we observed that the latter approach is useful for conformational transitions in the order of 2–5 ms, thus barring optical access to the fast intra-burst channel activity that occurs in tens of µs. Therefore, the unitary transition analysis presented here was limited to the description of each burst as a single opening at the expense of missing activity during short openings. None the less, such an analysis, although lacking detail on unitary transitions, is a valid approach for estimating the duration of the mean open and closed state for a ligand-gated channel such as TRPV1, which has an open transition lasting for several hundreds of ms( Hui et al., 2003). The ideal experimental system would allow for sparse distribution( every ~1 micrometer) of the emitter-expressing receptors at the plasma membrane, so that the photon-count profile of individual molecules can be obtained with the SPAD imager with nanosecond resolution. However, in the absence of such technical advances, standard biophysical approaches are in place to provide insights on unitary gating events from an expressed population of channels. Interestingly, the similar rate constants obtained by noise analysis of the optical signal and from the subsequent modeling of the unitary transitions, suggest a strong internal consistency of data. Another limitation to consider in the analysis is the intrinsic blinking of the dye. In the present case, this represents roughly 12% of the PL1 transitions and therefore obfuscates efforts to obtain absolute values for the open probability. Our solution to bypass this issue was to linearly subtract this ‘background open probability’ post-hoc and to normalize the data to its maximal theoretical response. Still, even with this coarse approximation, the optical data is in surprising agreement with whole-cell electrophysiological recording of channel gating. Further, this approach allowed for the direct measurement of the steady-state activity of membrane receptors undergoing fast molecular rearrangements. Specifically, from our fluorescence recordings, we reasoned that Y671coum experiences a change of environment as part of the process of pore rearrangement associated to channel’s opening. This possibility is supported by the dynamic range for the optical measurements presented here, and closely overlaps with the dynamic range of burst activity observed in single-channel recordings of TRPV1 in response to capsaicin( i. e. 0. 1 to 1 μM)( Hui et al., 2003). The molecular dynamics simulations showed that Y671 could undergo three significant conformational changes during the channel’s transition from the conducting to the non-conducting conformation:( i) a side chain re-orientation with respect to the pore and pore helix,( ii) increased water exposure, and( iii) a reshaping of the H-bond interaction network. The spectral properties of coumarin are highly sensitive to changes in solvation and/or to changes in the coordination of the hydroxyl group of the dye( Wagner, 2009). Therefore, any of the modifications detected on MD simulations performed for the wild-type channel can potentially explain the observed changes in fluorescence. As a consequence, a detailed structural interpretation at the level of side-chain dynamics for the fluorescence fluctuations remains out of reach. Moreover, the data presented here do not prove a causal relationship between the motion of the aromatic side chain and the state of the pore helix.","answer":"Cells use proteins on their surface as sensors to help them to assess and explore their environments and adapt to external conditions . The transient receptor potential ( TRP ) ion channels form one such family of proteins . Sodium , potassium and calcium ions can move through TRP channels to enter and exit cells , and by doing so trigger changes in the cell that help it respond to an external stimulus . The channels have physical “gates” that can open and close to control the flow of the ions . When the TRP channel detects a stimulus – which could take the form of specific chemicals , or a change in temperature , pressure or voltage – it changes shape , causing the gate to open . Researchers have a number of unanswered questions about how TRP channels work . Where in the channels are gates located ? How do the channels control the flow of ions , and how do they communicate with each other ? And which regions of the protein sense environmental cues ? As a result , new technologies are being developed to make it easier to study the types of rearrangements that TRP channels experience when they activate . Steinberg , Kasimova et al . have used total internal reflection microscopy – a method that images fluorescent molecules – to measure the conformational change of a single TRP channel in a living cell . This channel , called TRPV1 , senses external heat and plays an important role in pain perception . Its gate can also be opened by the pungent compound of chili pepper , capsaicin . The results of the experiments suggest that a selectivity filter region in TRPV1 channels changes its shape when the channel opens in response to capsaicin . Then , this selectivity filter appears to do double duty – it controls which types of ions pass through the channels as well as controlling their flow rate . Because of its role in pain perception , having a better understanding of how TRPV1 works will be valuable for researchers who are trying to develop new pain relief treatments .

The branched character of their respiratory chains allows bacteria to do so by providing a great metabolic and regulatory flexibility. Here, we show that the native localization of the nitrate reductase, a major respiratory complex under anaerobiosis in Escherichia coli, is submitted to tight spatiotemporal regulation in response to metabolic conditions via a mechanism using the transmembrane proton gradient as a cue for polar localization. These dynamics are critical for controlling the activity of nitrate reductase, as the formation of polar assemblies potentiates the electron flux through the complex. Thus, dynamic subcellular localization emerges as a critical factor in the control of respiration in bacteria.Introduction:Respiration is an essential process for most living organisms. The free energy derived from oxidation of reducing equivalents generated by cell metabolism or taken up from the environment is converted into a protonmotive force( pmf) across a membrane that is used, among many processes, to drive adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Although oxygen is the most common terminal electron acceptor of respiratory chains, prokaryotes can make use of alternative acceptors in anoxic environments, such as nitrogen oxides, elemental sulfur and sulfur oxyanions, organic N-oxides, etc. In eukaryotes, respiration is confined to a specific organelle, the mitochondrion and more specifically to its inner membrane which displays remarkably intricate ultra-structural features that impact the respiratory output( Cogliati et al., 2013). Respiration involves multimeric membrane-embedded oxidative phosphorylation( OXPHOS) complexes which bear several metal cofactors through which electrons are transported. The organization of OXPHOS complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane has been the subject of intense debate during the last decade after the discovery of supramolecular assemblies by the landmark study of Schägger in 2000( Schägger and Pfeiffer, 2000), later substantiated by electron microscopy studies( for a review, see Vonck and Schafer, 2009). Plasticity of the almost linear mitochondrial OXPHOS chain is ensured by a dynamic equilibrium between isolated complexes and supramolecular assemblies which is, in turn, influenced by both specific lipids and stabilizing factors( Zhang et al., 2002; Ikeda et al., 2013). Such an equilibrium is likely beneficial for the function of the mitochondrion allowing the cell to respond to cellular and environmental cues. Moreover, the extraordinarily low degradation rate of OXPHOS complexes in mitochondria( Price et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2013) reinforces the idea that the dynamic association into supercomplexes adds an effective switch to control electron flows in response to environmental changes( Lapuente-Brun et al., 2013). The flexibility of energy metabolism is also critical for the adaptation of a number of prokaryotes to varying environments( Unden et al., 2014). The utilization of modular OXPHOS chains confers flexibility depending on the available energy source or terminal electron acceptor but also allows modulation of the resulting pmf. So far, the adjustment of respiration to varying environments in prokaryotes is considered to be the result of an intricate transcriptional regulation network that controls the expression of OXPHOS complexes with varying electrogenic capacities. At the same time, there is cumulative evidence for an elaborate spatial organization of macromolecules in bacterial cells. We thus hypothesized that the OXPHOS process could be regulated through the dynamic subcellular localization of complexes in response to the metabolic demand. Here, we investigate the native localization of a major OXPHOS complex under anoxic conditions, the quinol oxidizing nitrate reductase complex from the gut bacterium Escherichia coli, and its dynamics upon changes in the environment by real-time fluorescence imaging in live cells.Discussion:In the past decade, the emerging field of bacterial cell biology has underscored the fact that dynamic subcellular localization is intimately linked to the biological function allowing control of fundamental processes, such as cell division, virulence, motility, or signal transduction( for reviews, see Kiekebusch and Thanbichler, 2014; Laloux and Jacobs-Wagner, 2014; Nevo-Dinur et al., 2012; Shapiro et al., 2009). Similarly, we have shown that the nitrate reductase respiratory complex is submitted to a spatiotemporal regulation in response to environmental conditions which, in turns, potentiates the electron flux through the associated respiratory chain. Nitrate respiration in E. coli is thus controlled by specific subcellular localization of its terminal reductase. Segregation of respiratory complexes within the cytoplasmic membrane has also been reported for components of bacterial aerobic chains( Johnson et al., 2004; Lenn et al., 2008; Werner et al., 2009; Rexroth et al., 2011; Llorente-Garcia et al., 2014). The actual view is that functional consequences are associated with a high level of structural organization of respiratory complexes within bioenergetic membranes( for a review, see Genova and Lenaz, 2014). Interestingly enough, recent studies have evidenced the existence of functional microdomains in bacterial membranes organizing a specific subset of proteins in space and time surmising a gain-of-function( Lopez and Kolter, 2010). In the same line of thought, it has recently been shown that clustering of multiple enzymes belonging to the same metabolic pathway into agglomerates accelerates the processing of intermediates( Castellana et al., 2014). Clearly, several alternatives can be found for the reported enhanced electron flux in the nitrate reductase-associated respiratory chains such as physical association into supercomplexes or segregating respiratory complexes into microdomains. In both cases, one would hypothesize that the probability of the quinone molecules to encounter the nitrate reductase is higher. Evidences have been provided for such quinone channeling within supercomplexes while the exact mechanism of channeling is not yet understood( for a review, see Genova and Lenaz, 2014). By providing the first evidence for a spatiotemporal regulation of a respiratory complex in response to environmental conditions, this work establishes a basis for a deeper analysis on how environmental signals are translated into subcellular localization of respiratory complexes to adjust the respiration output.","answer":"Respiration occurs at different levels: the body , the organ , and the cells . At the cellular level , it is a molecular process that produces a high-energy molecule called adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) using the biochemical energy stored in sugars , fatty acids , and other nutrients . Along with the ATP , this process also provides another source of energy to the cell: an electrochemical gradient across the membrane used for a range of processes ranging from the transport of molecules and ions to cell motility . In order to thrive , cells need to quickly respond to cues from the environment or elsewhere in the cell . A cell must therefore have the ability to increase or decrease cellular respiration and the production of ATP to ensure it has an appropriate supply of energy . In bacteria , the protein complexes responsible for cellular respiration are embedded in the cell membrane . In the past decade , research has suggested that large molecules are arranged in a specific way throughout the bacterial cell , which directly influences how they work . Alberge et al . tested this idea by studying the localization of a respiratory complex called nitrate reductase—which is important for generating energy in the absence of oxygen—through the introduction of a fluorescent marker tagged to the complex in the cell membrane of a rod-shaped bacterium called Escherichia coli . This allowed the complex to be tracked when the cells were viewed using a microscope . The experiments revealed that the location of the complex varies depending on how much energy the cell requires . For example , when the cells are in an oxygen-poor environment , the nitrate reductase complex moves towards the poles at each end of the bacterial cells . This allows the cells to produce ATP more efficiently through respiration of nitrate . Alberge et al . show that a ‘proton gradient’ , caused by positively charged hydrogen ions moving through the cell membrane as the result of respiration , controls where the complexes are located in the membrane . Alberge et al . 's findings provide experimental support that dynamic localization of respiratory complexes plays an important role in controlling respiration in bacteria . The next challenge will be to identify the genes that influence the distribution of respiratory complexes throughout the cell , which may help to explain how bacterial cells have adapted to specific environments ."},{"question":"You will be presented with the full text of a science research paper.

? ?* hazard , 1961 ) ) . after giving an occultation talk at sydney university ,he had been invited by joseph pawsey , of csiro radiophysics , to use the parkes telescope as a guest observer to make further observations . at parkes ,hazard was well supported by brian mackey and john shimmins as well as by the parkes director , john bolton .hazard s motivation for the occultation work was to provide precise , arcsecond radio positions for high galactic latitude radio sources in order to establish their nature , which he had strong evidence for being extra - galactic .hazard had noted that the radio source 3c273 would be occulted by the moon several times that year .moreover , these occultations would be visible at the newly completed parkes 210 foot radio telescope .the importance of these occultations was that they were capable of yielding a precise radio position with arcsecond accuracy and that the position was in the optical reference frame .    in 1962 , the year of these dramatic observations , maarten schmidt had taken on the optical identification and spectroscopy of the objects identified based on radio positions measured with the owens valley interferometer ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?* read , 1963 ) ) . in thishe was ably supported by tom matthews who made the essential optical position measurements on the palomar schmidt plates ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?* matthews & sandage 1962 ) ) .the first occultation observation took place at 410 mhz on may 15 1962 , when only the emersion was visible .the emersion occurred as the moon was entering the field of view of the telescope with the telescope stationary at the elevation limit .the record was complicated by the presence of the rapid increase in level as the moon entered the beam .but what was interesting was the clear presence of two well - defined diffraction fringes .this was the first time that these had been seen and clearly identified the presence of a component of diameter no more than @xmath0 arcseconds .such small components implied that the necessary arcsecond position would be attainable .unfortunately , the record was unsuitable for a more detailed analysis .but it did make clear the importance of the august 5 , 1962 occultation , for which both immersion and emersion would be visible . however , the emersion was scheduled to occur at an elevation close to the 30 degree limit of the parkes telescope .    before the scheduled august 5 ,1962 observations bolton was concerned about the possible low elevation and undertook significant surgery on the telescope .as it happened , it was unnecessary , but it made a great story ( c.f .comments by frank kerr in serendipitous discoveries in radio astronomy , p 174 , 1983 ) .the \`\` problem '' was that the predictions from hm nautical almanac office were given not for parkes , but for the fleurs field station 275 km east - south - east of parkes .the august 5 , 1962 occultation was undertaken with concentric feeds at 410 mhz and 136 mhz where the telescope half - power beamwidths are 48 arcminutes and three times this , respectively ( ( * ? ? ?* bolton et al . , 1964 ) ) .the telescope was unable to track the moon , and could only track the radio source .both immersion and emersion were observed and the records showed clearly the presence of two components in the source .the immersion and emersion records at both 136 and 410 mhz are plotted as figure 1 ; time increases from right to left , and the motion of the moon is also from right to left .3c273 is clearly a double source at 410 mhz , aligned so that both components reappear together along p.a .45 degrees .however , the immersion record at 136 mhz shows no evidence for a second component as is shown at 410 mhz .hazard started his preliminary analysis of the records immediately after the occultation .    on august 20,1962 , while hazard was still involved in his analysis , bolton wrote a letter to maarten schmidt ( section reproduced below ) about a separate potential parkes identification .he also asked \`\` would you also pass on to tom ( matthews ) the following position for 3c273 '' , but gave no reference as to its origin .he also added a p.s .saying \`\` the position of 3c273 is subject to arithmetic errors as yet undetected ! ''figure 2 suggests that the optical identification , as seen by schmidt and matthews , was most likely what we now know as the \`\` jet '' , but was initially thought to be a faint edge - on galaxy .the radio source has exactly the same position angle , 45@xmath1 , and the same length as the optical \`\` jet '' , @xmath2 arcseconds , but displaced laterally by about 5 arcseconds .such a coincidence would otherwise be most unlikely .however , the exact nature of the bright @xmath3th magnitude \`\` star '' is clearly uncertain ; is it merely a random foreground star , or , alternatively , is it somehow associated with the \`\` jet '' ?this situation posed a serious question for schmidt , as well as for us now . why did this position differ from that given later in the _ nature _ paper ?bolton s letter is dated august 20,1962 , barely two weeks after the occultation and hazard was still engaged in his analysis . as thiswas the first time that diffraction fringes had been seen , their presence presented a new challenge and the analysis was complex .the most likely reason for bolton passing on this position is that hazard s analysis was still incomplete . at 136 mhz componentb has effectively disappeared due to the steeper spectral index . at 410 mhzthe separation between the components is 20 arcseconds ; so a possible solution could be to put component b half way between the 410 mhz positions .alternatively , bolton may have misread the numbers . however , at the time the question for schmidt was not pressing , because for the next four months , 3c273 was up only in daylight hours and so was inaccessible at the 200 inch .in the meantime the october 26 , 1962 immersion observations were undertaken successfully at parkes , this time at 410 and 1,420 mhz , as this was the standard concentric feed configuration in use at that time for the parkes sky survey .the october occultation results are shown in figure 3 .        at 410 mhzboth components show clear fringes , indicating angular sizes of 1 - 2 arcseconds for both . at 1420 mhz , where the fresnel scale is much smaller , component a shows at best a small bump , while b exhibits strong fringes .component b is significantly smaller than a at the sub - arcsecond scale .a detailed analysis of these observations was later undertaken ( @xcite ) showing that both components at 410 mhz have diameters less than 2 arcseconds , while at 1420 mhz component b is less than 0.5 arcseconds in diameter .also interesting is the relative increase in source fraction at 1420 mhz .the spectral index of the more compact component b was found to be flat at 0.0 , whereas that of a was steep at -0.9 .the august 1962 record shows component a totally dominates at 136 mhz with @xmath4% of the total flux density . herewas the first concrete evidence for an inverted - spectrum , sub - arcsecond component , b , in a radio source .the low - frequency surveys of the 1950s and 60s preferentially found the steep - spectrum sources .it would be for the later high - frequency surveys to uncover these compact , flat - spectrum sources .    for both the august and october 1962 occultations , hazard s3c273 analysis had revealed a \`\` core - jet '' structure with \`\` normal '' steep - spectrum component a and an inverted - spectrum , very compact component b. the final image and positional information was determined by hazard in collaboration with w.nicholson of the h.m .nautical almanac .the detailed arcsecond resolution image is given here in figure 4 , taken from hazard et al .on january 31 , 1963 hazard wrote to schmidt with the correct occultation structure and positions for a and b and suggested a joint publication . on january 26 1962, bolton also wrote to schmidt giving the positions .        in the meantime , schmidt had undertaken spectroscopy at the 200 inch on the nights of 27 and 29 december 1962 , his first opportunity to do so .he was faced with a practical dilemma .he assumed that the bright \`\` star '' was merely a confusing foreground bright 13th magnitude galactic star . to obtain a spectrum of the faint jet , which was by far the most likely identification based on the information he had received from bolton , he had to place the slit of the spectrograph along the extended jet for a long exposure .in doing it was inevitable that the bright confusing star 10 arcseconds away would spill over into any spectrum of the jet he would obtain .to offset this , he had decided to first obtain a spectrum of this bright star .his first attempt on the night of december 27 was overexposed .although he had the world s largest optical telescope at his disposal , his detector was a photographic plate with efficiency no more than a few percent ; thus exposure times were not always easy to determine . on the night of december 29 , 1962he managed to obtain a spectrum of the \`\` star '' that was not overexposed , which showed some faint emission lines , but with no obvious explanation in terms of any expected stellar lines ._ \`\` it happened on 6 february 1963 . in responseto hazard s letter i decided to have another look at the spectra ... for reasons that i do nt remember i tried to construct an energy - level diagram .when the energy levels did not come out regularly spaced , i was annoyed ... to check on the regularity of the observed lines , i decided to compare them with the balmer lines of hydrogen ... specifically , i took for each line in 3c 273 the ratio of its wavelength over the wavelength of the nearest balmer line .the first ratio was 1.16 , the second was ... also 1.16 .+ it suddenly struck me that i might be seeing a redshift . when the third and fourth ratios were also close to 1.16 , it was abundantly clear that i was seeing in 3c 273 a redshifted balmer spectrum .

The interleukin 2 receptor alpha-chain (IL-2R alpha) gene is rapidly and potently induced in T cells in response to mitogenic stimuli. Previously, an inducible enhancer between nucleotides-299 and-228 that contains NF-kappa B and CArG motifs was identified. We now report the characterization of a second essential positive regulatory element located between nucleotides-137 and-64 that binds Elf-1 and HMG-I (Y). This element had maximal activity in lymphoid cells, paralleling the cell type specificity of Elf-1 expression. Transcription from the IL-2R alpha promoter was inhibited when either the Elf-1 or the HMG-I (Y) binding site was mutated. Coexpression of both proteins activated transcription of the-137 to-64 element in COS-7 cells. Elf-1 physically associated with HMG-I and with NF-kappa B p50 and c-Rel in vitro, suggesting that protein-protein interactions might functionally coordinate the actions of the upstream and downstream positive regulatory elements. This is the first report of a physical interaction between an Ets family member and NF-kappa B family proteins. These findings provide significant new insights into the protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that regulate cell-type-specific and inducible IL-2R alpha gene expression and also have implications for other genes regulated by Elf-1 and NF-kappa B family proteins.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"COS - 7 cells\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"lymphoid cells\\", \\"T cells\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"interleukin 2 receptor alpha - chain (IL - 2R alpha) gene\\", \\"nucleotides - 299 and - 228\\", \\"Elf - 1 or the HMG - I (Y) binding site\\", \\"upstream and downstream positive regulatory elements\\", \\"an Ets family member\\", \\"IL - 2R alpha promoter\\", \\"- 137 to - 64 element\\", \\"nucleotides - 137 and - 64\\", \\"NF - kappa B and CArG motifs\\", \\"Elf - 1\\", \\"essential positive regulatory element\\", \\"inducible enhancer\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"p50\\", \\"interleukin 2 receptor alpha - chain\\", \\"HMG - I\\", \\"NF - kappa B family proteins\\", \\"HMG - I (Y)\\", \\"c - Rel\\", \\"IL - 2R alpha\\", \\"interleukin - 2 receptor alpha - chain\\", \\"Elf - 1\\", \\"NF - kappa B\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper. Please extract text from the paragraph to answer the question. Do not include any text in your repsonse other than the answer.Paragraph: Evolutionary analyses have shown that bats and rodents are the gene sources of most αCoVs and βCoVs, while avian species are the gene sources of most δCoVs and γCoVs. CoVs have repeatedly crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens. The best-known examples include severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) which emerged in China in 2002-2003 to cause a large-scale epidemic with about 8000 infections and 800 deaths, and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) which has caused a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula since 2012 [2, 3] . In both of these epidemics, these viruses have likely originated from bats and then jumped into another amplification mammalian host [the Himalayan palm civet (Paguma larvata) for SARS-CoV and the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) for MERS-CoV] before crossing species barriers to infect humans. Prior to December 2019, 6 CoVs were known to infect human, including 2 αCoV (HCoV-229E and HKU-NL63) and 4 βCoV (HCoV-OC43 [ HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 usually cause self-limiting upper respiratory infections in immunocompetent hosts and occasionally lower respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised hosts and elderly [4] . In contrast, SARS-CoV (lineage B βCoV) and MERS-CoV (lineage C βCoV) may cause severe lower respiratory tract infection with acute respiratory distress syndrome and extrapulmonary manifestations, such as diarrhea, lymphopenia, deranged liver and renal function tests, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, among both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts with mortality rates of ∼10% and ∼35%, respectively [5, 6] . On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China [7] . Subsequent virological testing showed that a novel CoV was detected in these patients. As of 16 January 2020, 43 patients have been diagnosed to have infection with this novel CoV, including two exported cases of mild pneumonia in Thailand and Japan [8, 9] . The earliest date of symptom onset was 1 December 2019 [10] . The symptomatology of these patients included fever, malaise, dry cough, and dyspnea. Among 41 patients admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan, 13 (32%) required intensive care and 6 (15%) died. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest computerized tomography scans [10] . We recently reported a familial cluster of 2019-nCoV infection in a Shenzhen family with travel history to Wuhan [11] . In the present study, we analyzed a 2019-nCoV complete genome from a patient in this familial cluster and compared it with the genomes of related βCoVs to provide insights into the potential source and control strategies. The complete genome sequence of 2019-nCoV HKU-SZ-005b was available at GenBank (accession no. MN975262) ( Table 1 ). The representative complete genomes of other related βCoVs strains collected from human or mammals were included for comparative analysis. These included strains collected from human, bats, and Himalayan palm civet between 2003 and 2018, with one 229E coronavirus strain as the outgroup. Phylogenetic tree construction by the neighbour joining method was performed using MEGA X software, with bootstrap values being calculated from 1000 trees [12] . The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) was shown next to the branches [13] . The tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method and were in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site [14] . All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair (pairwise deletion option). Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X [15] . Multiple alignment was performed using CLUSTAL 2.1 and further visualized using BOX-SHADE 3.21. Structural analysis of orf8 was performed using PSI-blast-based secondary structure PREDiction (PSIPRED) [16] . For the prediction of protein secondary structure including beta sheet, alpha helix, and coil, initial amino acid sequences were input and analysed using neural networking and its own algorithm. Predicted structures were visualized and highlighted on the BOX-SHADE alignment. Prediction of transmembrane domains was performed using the TMHMM 2.0 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). Secondary structure prediction in the 5 ′ -untranslated region (UTR) and 3 ′ -UTR was performed using the RNAfold WebServer (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/ RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi) with minimum free energy (MFE) and partition function in Fold algorithms and Table 2 .

Putative function/domain Amino acid position Putative cleave sitecomplex with nsp3 and 6: DMV formationcomplex with nsp3 and 4: DMV formationshort peptide at the end of orf1a basic options. The human SARS-CoV 5 ′ -and 3 ′ -UTR were used as references to adjust the prediction results. The single-stranded RNA genome of the 2019-nCoV was 29891 nucleotides in size, encoding 9860 amino acids. The G + C content was 38%. Similar to other (Table 2 ). There are no remarkable differences between the orfs and nsps of 2019-nCoV with those of SARS-CoV (Table 3) . The major distinction between SARSr-CoV and SARS-CoV is in orf3b, Spike and orf8 but especially variable in Spike S1 and orf8 which were previously shown to be recombination hot spots. Spike glycoprotein comprised of S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit contains a signal peptide, followed by an N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD), while the S2 subunit contains conserved fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat (HR) 1 and 2, transmembrane domain (TM), and cytoplasmic domain (CP). We found that the S2 subunit of 2019-nCoV is highly conserved and shares 99% identity with those of the two bat SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45) and human SARS-CoV (Figure 2 ). Thus the broad spectrum antiviral peptides against S2 would be an important preventive and treatment modality for testing in animal models before clinical trials [18] . Though the S1 subunit of 2019-nCoV shares around 70% identity to that of the two bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS-CoV (Figure 3(A) ), the core domain of RBD (excluding the external subdomain) are highly conserved (Figure 3(B) ). Most of the amino acid differences of RBD are located in the external subdomain, which is responsible for the direct interaction with the host receptor. Further investigation of this soluble variable external subdomain region will reveal its receptor usage, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis. Unlike 2019-nCoV and human SARS-CoV, most known bat SARSr-CoVs have two stretches of deletions in the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) when compared with that of human SARS-CoV. But some Yunnan strains such as the WIV1 had no such deletions and can use human ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor. It is interesting to note that the two bat SARS-related coronavirus ZXC21 and ZC45, being closest to 2019-nCoV, can infect suckling rats and cause inflammation in the brain tissue, and pathological changes in lung & intestine. However, these two viruses could not be isolated in Vero E6 cells and were not investigated further. The two retained deletion sites in the Spike genes of ZXC21 and ZC45 may lessen their likelihood of jumping species barriers imposed by receptor specificity. A novel short putative protein with 4 helices and no homology to existing SARS-CoV or SARS-r-CoV protein was found within Orf3b ( Figure 4 ). It is notable that SARS-CoV deletion mutants lacking orf3b replicate to levels similar to those of wildtype virus in several cell types [19] , suggesting that orf3b is dispensable for viral replication in vitro. But orf3b may have a role in viral pathogenicity as Vero E6 but not 293T cells transfected with a construct expressing Orf3b underwent necrosis as early as 6 h after transfection and underwent simultaneous necrosis and apoptosis at later time points [20] . Orf3b was also shown to inhibit expression of IFN-β at synthesis and signalling [21] . Subsequently, orf3b homologues identified from three bat SARSrelated-CoV strains were C-terminally truncated and lacked the C-terminal nucleus localization signal of SARS-CoV [22] . IFN antagonist activity analysis demonstrated that one SARS-related-CoV orf3b still possessed IFN antagonist and IRF3-modulating activities. These results indicated that different orf3b proteins display different IFN antagonist activities and this function is independent of the protein's nuclear localization, suggesting a potential link between bat SARS-related-CoV orf3b function and pathogenesis. The importance of this new protein in 2019-nCoV will require further validation and study. Orf8 orf8 is an accessory protein found in the Betacoronavirus lineage B coronaviruses. Human SARS-CoVs isolated from early-phase patients, all civet SARS-CoVs, and other bat SARS-related CoVs contain fulllength orf8 [23] . However, a 29-nucleotide deletion,Bat SL-CoV ZXC21 2018Bat which causes the split of full length of orf8 into putative orf8a and orf8b, has been found in all SARS-CoV isolated from mid-and late-phase human patients [24] . In addition, we have previously identified two bat SARS-related-CoV (Bat-CoV YNLF_31C and YNLF_34C) and proposed that the original SARS-CoV full-length orf8 is acquired from these two bat SARS-related-CoV [25] . Since the SARS-CoV is the closest human pathogenic virus to the 2019-nCoV, we performed phylogenetic analysis and multiple alignments to investigate the orf8 amino acid sequences. The orf8 protein sequences used in the analysis derived from early phase SARS-CoV that includes full-length orf8 (human SARS-CoV GZ02), the mid-and late-phase SARS-CoV that includes the split orf8b (human SARS-CoV Tor2), civet SARS-CoV (paguma SARS-CoV), two bat SARS-related-CoV containing full-length orf8 (bat-CoV YNLF_31C and YNLF_34C), 2019-nCoV, the other two closest bat SARS-related-CoV to 2019-nCoV SL-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45), and bat SARS-related-CoV HKU3-1 ( Figure 5(A) ). As expected, orf8 derived from 2019-nCoV belongs to the group that includes the closest genome sequences of bat SARS-related-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45. Interestingly, the new 2019-nCoV orf8 is distant from the conserved orf8 or Figure 5(B) ) which was shown to trigger intracellular stress pathways and activates NLRP3 inflammasomes [26] , but this is absent in this novel orf8 of 2019-nCoV. Based on a secondary structure prediction, this novel orf8 has a high possibility to form a protein with an alpha-helix, following with a betasheet(s) containing six strands ( Figure 5(C) ). The genome of 2019-nCoV has overall 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-related-CoV SL-CoVZXC21 (MG772934.1), and 82% with human SARS-CoV BJ01 2003 (AY278488) and human SARS-CoV Tor2 (AY274119). The phylogenetic trees constructed using the amino acid sequences of orf1a/b and the 4 structural genes (S, E, M, and N) were shown (Figure 6(A-E) ). For all these 5 genes, the 2019-nCoV was clustered with lineage B βCoVs. It was most closely related to the bat SARS-related CoVs ZXC21 and ZC45 found in Chinese horseshoe As shown in Figure 7 (A-C), the SARS-CoV 5 ′ -UTR contains SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4, S5, SL5A, SL5B, SL5C, SL6, SL7, and SL8. The SL3 contains trans-cis motif [27] . The SL1, SL2, SL3, SL4, S5, SL5A, SL5B, and SL5C structures were similar among the 2019-nCoV, human SARS-CoV and the bat SARS-related ZC45. In the 2019-nCoV, part of the S5 found was inside Figure 7 Continued the orf1a/b (marked in red), which was similar to SARS-CoV. In bat SARS-related CoV ZC45, the S5 was not found inside orf1a/b. The 2019-nCoV had the same SL6, SL7, and SL8 as SARS-CoV, and an additional stem loop. Bat SARS-related CoV ZC45 did not have the SARS-COV SL6-like stem loop. Instead, it possessed two other stem loops in this region. All three strains had similar SL7 and SL8.Question: What strains were included in  this study?","answer":"strains collected from human, bats, and Himalayan palm civet between 2003 and 2018, with one 229E coronavirus strain as the outgroup."},{"question":"You will be presented with a collection of medical randomized controlled trial (RCT) reports addressing a shared clinical question -- for instance, the efficacy of a medical intervention on a disease or condition.

METHODS Clinical characteristics of 87 African-American patients with head and neck cancer and a r and om sample of 261 white patients matched on age and smoking dose were associated with outcome . RESULTS Black patients with cancers of the oral cavity and larynx were more likely diagnosed with advanced stages than whites , after adjusting for socioeconomic and insurance status and other confounding factors . There was a significant difference in relapse-free survival between blacks and whites with tumors of the larynx ( hazard ratio [ HR ] = 3.36 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 1.62 - 7.00 ) , but not with tumors of the oral cavity or pharynx . CONCLUSIONS Differences in disease outcome may be attributed to a combination of tumor stage , socioeconomic status , and access to health care . The inclusion of biologic markers such as human papillomavirus ( HPV ) status is needed in future studies to further evaluate racial disparities in head and neck cancer outcomesTitle 2:The Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trialsAbstract 2:Flaws in the design , conduct , analysis , and reporting of r and omised trials can cause the effect of an intervention to be underestimated or overestimated .

Population -based data have been unable to explain these differences . AIMS To describe survival from head and neck cancers in a large cohort of patients for whom a range of socio-economic , demographic , behavioural and casemix data was available . METHODS Prospect i ve cohort study using data from the Scottish Head and Neck Audit on all patients diagnosed with a head and neck cancer in Scotl and between 1st September 1999 and 31st August 2001 linked to General Register Office for Scotl and death records to 30th June 2006 . Cox proportional hazards models were produced to describe adjusted hazards of death according to socio-economic circumstances , using vali date d area-based DEPCAT scores . RESULTS Data on 1909 patients were analysed . 71.0 % were male and mean age was 64.3 ( SD 12.2 ) years .  Overall 5-year survival was 45.6 % ( 95 % CI : 43.4 - 47.8 % ) . In order of strength of association in univariate regression , World Health Organisation Performance Status , disease stage , patient age , tumour site , smoking status , alcohol use , tumour differentiation , and deprivation were significant predictors of all-cause mortality but after multiple adjustment , deprivation was no longer an independent predictor of survival . CONCLUSIONS Socio-economic differentials in survival from head and neck cancers are determined by a mixture of risk factors , some of which may be amenable to targeted earlier detection methods and lifestyle interventions . However , further research is needed to underst and the impacts of performance status in more deprived patientsTitle 4:Effect of education level on outcome of patients treated on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Protocol 90‐03Abstract 4:It has been hypothesized that people in lower socioeconomic groups have worse outcomes because they present with advanced‐stage cancers or receive inadequate treatment .

However , previous studies have been too small to examine the associations by cancer subsite , age , sex , global region and calendar time and to explain the association in terms of behavioral risk factors . Individual participant data of 23,964 cases with head and neck cancer and 31,954 controls from 31 studies in 27 countries pooled with r and om effects models . Overall , low education was associated with an increased risk of head and neck cancer ( OR = 2.50 ; 95 % CI = 2.02 – 3.09 ) . Overall one‐third of the increased risk was not explained by differences in the distribution of cigarette smoking and alcohol behaviors ; and it remained elevated among never users of tobacco and nondrinkers ( OR = 1.61 ; 95 % CI = 1.13 – 2.31 ) . More of the estimated education effect was not explained by cigarette smoking and alcohol behaviors : in women than in men , in older than younger groups , in the oropharynx than in other sites , in South/ Central America than in Europe/North America and was strongest in countries with greater income ine quality . Similar findings were observed for the estimated effect of low versus high household income . The lowest levels of income and educational attainment were associated with more than 2‐fold increased risk of head and neck cancer , which is not entirely explained by differences in the distributions of behavioral risk factors for these cancers and which varies across cancer sites , sexes , countries and country income ine quality levelsTitle 6:Emotional well‐being does not predict survival in head and neck cancer patientsAbstract 6:The objective of the current study was to examine whether  emotional well‐being predicted survival in a large sample of patients with head and neck cancer who were participating in multicenter clinical trialsTitle 7:Explaining socioeconomic status effects in laryngeal cancer.Abstract 7:INTRODUCTION People with lower socioeconomic status ( SES ) experience shorter survival times after a cancer diagnosis for many disease sites . We determined whether area-level SES was associated with the outcomes : cause-specific survival and local-regional failure in laryngeal cancer in Ontario , Canada . When we found an association we sought explanations that might be related to access to care including age , sex , rural residence , tumor stage , lymph node status , use of diagnostic imaging , treatment type , percentage of prescribed radiotherapy delivered , number of radiotherapy interruption days , treatment waiting time , and treating cancer center . MATERIAL S AND METHODS The study population consisted of 661 glottic and 495 supraglottic stage-stratified r and omly- sample d patients identified using the Ontario Cancer Registry . Area-level SES quintiles were assigned using adjusted median household income from the Canadian Census . Other data were collected from patient charts . Explanations for SES effects were determined by measuring whether the effect moved toward the null value by at least 10 % when an access indicator was added to a the model . RESULTS Socioeconomic status was not related to either outcome for those with supraglottic cancer , but an association was present in glottic cancer . With the highest socioeconomic status quintile as the referent group , the relative risks for patients in the lowest socioeconomic quintile were 2.75 ( 95 % CI 1.48 , 5.12 ) for cause-specific survival and 1.90 ( 95 % CI 1.24 , 2.93 ) for local-regional failure . Disease stage as measured by T-category explained between 3 % and 23 % of these socioeconomic effects . None of the other access indicators met our 10 % change criterion . CONCLUSION We question why people in lower socioeconomic quintiles were not diagnosed earlier in the disease progression . Having ruled out several variables that may be related to access to care , additional biologic and social variables should be examined to further underst and socioeconomic status effectsTitle 8:Combined P16 and human papillomavirus testing predicts head and neck cancer survivalAbstract 8:While its prognostic significance remains unclear , p16INK4a protein expression is increasingly being used as a surrogate marker for oncogenic human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas ( HNSCC ) . To evaluate the prognostic utility of p16 expression in HNSCC , we prospect ively collected 163 primary tumor specimens from histologically confirmed HNSCC patients who were followed for up to 9.4 years .  Formalin fixed tumor specimens were tested for  p16 protein expression by immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . HPV type‐16 DNA and RNA was detected by MY09/11‐PCR and E6/E7 RT‐PCR on matched frozen tissue , respectively . P16 protein expression was detected more often in oropharyngeal tumors ( 53 % ) as compared with laryngeal ( 24 % ) , hypopharyngeal ( 8 % ) or oral cavity tumors ( 4 % ; p < 0.0001 ) . With respect to prognosis , p16‐positive oropharyngeal tumors exhibited significantly better overall survival than p16‐negative tumors ( log‐rank test p = 0.04 ) , whereas no survival benefit was observed for nonoropharyngeal tumors . However , when both p16 and HPV DNA test results were considered , concordantly positive nonoropharyngeal tumors had significantly better disease‐specific survival than concordantly negative nonoropharyngeal tumors after controlling for sex , nodal stage , tumor size , tumor subsite , primary tumor site number , smoking and drinking [ adjusted hazard ratio ( HR ) = 0.04 , 0.01–0.54 ] . Compared with concordantly negative nonoropharyngeal HNSCC , p16(+)/HPV16(− ) nonoropharyngeal HNSCC ( n = 13 , 7 % ) demonstrated no significant improvement in disease‐specific survival when HPV16 was detected by RNA ( adjusted HR = 0.83 , 0.22–3.17 ) . Our findings show that p16 IHC alone has potential as a prognostic test for oropharyngeal cancer survival , but combined p16/HPV testing is necessary to identify HPV‐associated nonoropharyngeal HNSCC with better prognosis","answer":"The results will help identify gaps in the literature and therefore direct further novel research in the field ."},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of an NLP research paper, as well as the context surrounding that citation.

The aim of this study was to determine whether the care plan could improve the oral health-related quality of life of patients with PD . This study was conducted by purposive sampling and a quasi-experimental design . Patients with PD were assigned to either comprehensive periodontal treatment ( n = 32 ) or a simple cleaning regimen ( n = 32 ) . Their oral health-related quality of life ( OHRQoL ) was measured using the Taiwanese version of the Brief World Health Organization Quality of Life ( WHOQOL-BREF ) scale ( general QoL ) and the Oral Health Impact Profile ( OHIP-14 ) ( OHRQoL ) . Both scales were completed 14 , 28 , and 90 days after the initial assessment . The extent of PD in the experimental group was determined again at the end of the study . On the 28-item WHOQOL-BREF scale , the scores of the experimental group were higher than those of the control group on 5 items and the environmental domain at 14 days . There was a significant improvement in the experimental group on 2 items at 28 days and at 90 days after periodontal treatment ( both P < .05 ) . No difference was found between the 2 groups in score on the OHIP-14 ; however , there was a significant improvement in the experimental group in total score at 28 and 90 days after periodontal treatment ( both P < .05 ) . The number of teeth with probing depth ≥5 mm and the percentage of dental plaque were both significantly reduced after the intervention ( both P < .001 ) . Patients with a comprehensive plan for PD care showed some improvement in QoL , including in the environmental domain , and on the total score for OHRQoL. Comprehensive periodontal treatment also alleviated periodontal symptomsTitle 2:The mediating role of general self-efficacy in the association between perceived social support and oral health-related quality of life after initial periodontal therapyAbstract 2:Background Although initial periodontal therapy can ease some physical and psychological discomforts from periodontitis and improve patients ’ oral health-related quality of life ( OHRQoL ) , it is also vital to find positive re sources from psychological and social aspects to promote the overall OHRQoL. This study aims to explore the associations of perceived social support ( PSS ) and general self-efficacy with OHRQoL and the mediating role of general self-efficacy in PSS-OHRQoL association after initial periodontal therapy . Methods A prospect i ve case series study was conducted among consecutive out patients with chronic periodontitis during the period of July 2014–April 2015 . A total of 145 eligible patients responded to OHRQoL question naire and periodontal examination at baseline . About 4 to 5 weeks after initial periodontal therapy , 120 patients completed the second OHRQoL measurement and periodontal examination , along with PSS and general self-efficacy measurement . The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was used to determine the difference between baseline and post-treatment OHRQoL scores and periodontal parameters . Hierarchical linear regression analysis was used to explore the associations of PSS and general self-efficacy with post-treatment OHRQoL after adjusting for some demographic and periodontal variables . Asymptotic and resampling strategies were performed to explore the mediating role of general self-efficacy . Results Initial periodontal therapy result ed in a significant improvement in the mean total score and all domains of OHRQoL and all periodontal parameters measured . In hierarchical linear regression analysis , clinical attachment loss ( CAL ) was significantly and positively associated with post-treatment OHRQoL score ( β = 0.265 , p < 0.01 ) , while PSS ( β = −0.303 , p < 0.01 ) and general self-efficacy ( β = −0.221 , p < 0.01 ) were significantly and negatively associated with post-treatment OHRQL score , respectively . A significant mediating role of general self-efficacy ( a*b = −0.139 , BCa 95 % CI : −0.298 , −0.011 ) in the association between PSS and post-treatment OHRQoL was revealed , and the proportion of the mediating role of general self-efficacy was 31.4 % . Conclusions Initial periodontal therapy could significantly improve all aspects of OHRQoL. PSS and general self-efficacy could be the positive re sources for improving OHRQoL after initial periodontal therapy among patients with periodontitis . General self-efficacy partly mediated the association between PSS and post-treatmentTitle 3:Effect of periodontal surgery on oral health-related quality of life in patients who have completed initial periodontal therapy.Abstract 3:BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Patient-centered assessment s are particularly important in periodontal treatment in which their concerns may differ from the traditional clinical endpoints . However , information is limited regarding the influence of periodontal surgery on patients ' quality of life ( QoL ) . The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of surgical periodontal therapy on the oral health-related QoL of patients who have received initial periodontal therapy . METHODS A three-center prospect i ve clinical study design was used , with the study participants comprising patients with moderate to severe periodontitis . Following initial periodontal therapy , the participants received either surgical or non-surgical periodontal treatment . The Oral Health-related Quality of Life Model for Dental Hygiene ( OHRQL instrument ) , was used to assess participants ' oral health-related QoL at each periodontal assessment interval : baseline ( phase I ) , after initial therapy ( phase II ) and after surgery or during supportive periodontal therapy ( phase III ) . RESULTS Seventy-six patients ( 26 non-surgery , 50 surgery ) completed the third phase of OHRQL assessment and were subjected to data analysis . From phase II to III , an improvement was achieved in all clinical parameters ( p < 0.05 - 0.001 ) in the surgery group , whereas no such improvement was observed in the non-surgery group . In both groups , a significant difference in total OHRQL score was noted between phases I and III ( p < 0.001 for surgery and p < 0.05 for non-surgery ) . The OHRQL domain scores for pain and eating/chewing function showed a significant improvement between these time points . However , no further significant improvement in OHRQL scores was achieved from phase II to III . CONCLUSION A significant improvement in oral health-related QoL was noted between phases I and III in the surgery and non-surgery groups . Such improvement was less pronounced in the non-surgery vs. the surgery group . From phase II to III , neither surgery nor non-surgical treatment yielded significant improvement in oral health-relatedTitle 4:Evaluation of the effect of non-surgical periodontal treatment on oral health-related quality of life: estimation of minimal important differences 1 year after treatment.Abstract 4:AIM To evaluate an individually tailored oral health educational programme on patient-reported outcome compared with a st and ard oral health educational programme , assess change over time and determine minimal important differences ( MID ) in change scores for two different oral health related quality of life ( OHRQoL ) instrument after non-surgical periodontal treatment ( NSPT ) . MATERIAL S AND METHODS In a r and omized controlled trial evaluating two educational programmes , patients ( n = 87 ) with chronic periodontitis completed a question naire at baseline and after 12 months . OHRQoL was assessed with the General Oral Health Assessment Index ( GOHAI ) and the UK oral health-related quality -of-life measure ( OHQoL-UK ) . In addition , patients ' global rating of oral health and socio-demographic variables were recorded . The MID was estimated with anchor-based and distributions-based methods . RESULTS There were no differences between the two educational groups . The OHRQoL was significantly improved after treatment . The MID was approximately five for OHQoL-UK with a moderate ES , and three for GOHAI with a Small ES , and 46 - 50 % of the patients showed improvements beyond the MID . CONCLUSION Both oral health educational groups reported higher scores in OHRQoL after NSPT result ing in more positive well-being ( OHQoL-UK ) and less frequent oral problems ( GOHAI ) . OHQoL-UK gave a greater effect size and mean change scores but both instruments were associated with the participants ' self-rated change in oral health . The changes were meaningful for the patients supported by the estimated MIDTitle 5:Assessing the minimally important difference in the oral impact on daily performances index in patients treated for periodontitis.Abstract 5:AIM To assess changes over time and determine the minimally important difference ( MID ) in the Oral Impact on Daily Performances ( OIDP ) index for patients with severe generalized periodontitis receiving periodontal treatment .  METHODS This study was nested in a larger r and omized controlled trial and consisted of 45 consecutive subjects of the larger trial ( 17 receiving intensive and 28 receiving conservative periodontal care ) . The OIDP index assessed impacts on quality of life ( QoL ) at baseline and 1 month after treatment . Repeated- measures ANOVA was used for comparison over time and between treatment groups . To estimate the MID , two subjective global transition scales , related to periodontal and oral health , respectively , were used as anchors , whereas the effect size ( ES ) , st and ardized response mean and st and ard error of measurement were also calculated . RESULTS The mean OIDP score after treatment was significantly lower than at baseline , indicating improvement in QoL , but there were no differences between treatment groups . Based on an agreement between different methods , the MID of the OIDP index was around five scale points and corresponded to a moderate ES . CONCLUSION The MID for the OIDP index among patients treated for severe generalized periodontitis provides meaning to change scores and facilitates interpretation of findingsTitle 6:Pain response after psychological preparation for repeated periodontal surgery.Abstract 6:The effects of pre-surgery intervention messages on postsurgical pain and recovery in 42 female patients were compared . Each participant was scheduled for at least two periodontal surgeries and exposed to one of four messages before each surgery . Auditory and visual messages classified as \\" control enhancement \\" were associated with reduction of pain after the second surgery with no effect after the first surgeryTitle 7:Effect of initial periodontal therapy on oral health-related quality of life in patients with periodontitis in Japan.Abstract 7:BACKGROUND It is becoming increasingly important for periodontists and dental hygienists to take a biopsychosocial approach to care when considering periodontal interventions . However , information on how patients perceive periodontitis and its treatment is limited . The purpose of the present study is to gain insight into the patient perception of oral health and the impact that periodontitis and treatment have on self-assessed quality of life ( QoL ) . METHODS This was a prospect i ve , two-center , clinical study in Japan . Patients with periodontitis were assessed for their perceptions of oral health by using an instrument for oral health-related QoL ( OHRQL ) before and after initial periodontal therapy . RESULTS A total of 58 patients ( mean age : 53.6 years ; 23 male and 35 female ) participated in the study and completed initial periodontal therapy . At baseline , 97 % of the patients perceived that their oral health status impacted on their QoL in one or more ways . Pain , eating and chewing , and psychologic function were identified as compromised OHRQL domains . More than one-half of the patients rated their overall oral health as poor . Initial periodontal therapy , consisting mainly of oral hygiene instructions and scaling and root planing , significantly improved OHRQL scores ( P = 0.0027 ) . The effect size was calculated to be 0.51 , indicating a moderate improvement . Compared with baseline , a significantly higher proportion of patients reported rarely or never having a problem regarding OHRQL domains such as pain ( P = 0.0049 ) and eating and chewing ( P = 0.0145 ) after treatment . No significant difference in the OHRQL improvement was found with respect to disease severity . CONCLUSIONS Periodontitis negatively affected QoL in this population of Japanese patients with periodontitis . Conventional non-surgical periodontal therapy has a potential to ameliorate patient perceptions of oral healthTitle 8:Scaling and Root Planing per Quadrant Versus One-Stage Full-Mouth Disinfection: Assessment of the Impact of Chronic Periodontitis Treatment on Quality of Life--A Clinical Randomized, Controlled Trial.Abstract 8:BACKGROUND There are few r and omized , controlled clinical trials about the effect of non-surgical periodontal treatment on oral health-related quality of life ( OHRQL ) . This study aims to compare the effects of two different forms of non-surgical periodontal therapy , scaling and root planing ( SRP ) per quadrant and one-stage full-mouth disinfection ( FMD ) , on periodontal clinical parameters and OHRQL of patients with chronic periodontitis . METHODS In this r and omized , controlled clinical trial , the question naires Oral Impacts on Daily Performance ( OIDP ) and Oral Health and Quality of Life ( OHQoL ) were given to 90 patients divided into two groups : SRP ( n = 45 ) and FMD ( n = 45 ) . Periodontal clinical parameters recorded included probing depth , clinical attachment level , plaque index , and gingival index . For statistical analysis , χ(2 ) test , Fisher exact test , Mann-Whitney U test , and Wilcoxon test were used . Intention-to-treat analyses were performed at T0 ( baseline ) for periodontal clinical parameters , T1 ( 30 days after treatment ) for question naires , and T2 ( 180 days after treatment ) for both . RESULTS No significant differences were identified between the SRP and FMD groups in regard to OHQoL and OIDP scores when comparing the data of T1 and T2 . CONCLUSION Patients treated by both SRP and FMD showed improvement in all periodontal clinical parameters and OHRQL , with no significant differences between treatment groups","answer":"Conclusions NSPT procedures greatly improve the oral health-related quality of life within a short time , remaining stable after 3 months of treatment .Clinical relevance This systematic review brings forward summary evidence that NSPT improves the OHRQoL in adults with periodontitis from a patient-centred perception and remain stable in the short term"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (FNDI) is an inherited deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) and is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. In the present study we have analyzed the AVP-neurophysin II (AVP-NPII) gene in a Spanish kindred. Studies were performed on seven members (four clinically affected) of the family. Patients were diagnosed at the Hospital Universitario Gregorio Maranon (Madrid, Spain). The entire coding region of the AVP-NPII gene of all family members was amplified by PCR and sequenced. All affected individuals presented a missense mutation (G1757-- > A) that replaces glycine at position 23 with arginine within the NPII domain. The substitution was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis and was present in heterozygosis. Additionally, one of the asymptomatic relatives (a girl 8 months old at the time of study) was identified as carrier of the same mutation and developed the disease 3 months later. The alteration found in the second exon of the gene in this family seems to be responsible for the disease, as all individuals harboring the mutation had been previously diagnosed or have eventually developed FNDI. Identification of the molecular defect underlying FNDI in affected families is a powerful tool for early asymptomatic diagnosis in infants..","answer":"{\\"Disease\\": [\\"FNDI\\", \\"deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin\\", \\"Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus\\", \\"familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

The problem is compounded because A. baumannii survives for long periods by forming biofilms on surfaces and medical devices2,3. Persisting in all environments as a biofilm allows the bacterium enhanced opportunity to enter the body via open wounds, catheters and breathing tubes causing infections from pneumonia to septicemia4.</p><p>We have found that simple derivatives of the natural products oroidin and bromoageliferin inhibit and disperse biofilms from both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria,5–10 fungi11 and mixed species biofilms11. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that these 2-aminoimidazole (2AI) compounds work synergistically with conventional antibiotics to eradicate bacteria within a biofilm state as well as resensitize multidrug resistant bacteria to the effects of numerous antibiotics while the bacteria are in their planktonic state12. At this time mechanistic information to describe how these 2AI compounds control bacterial behavior has remained elusive. In this work we show that one of our 2AI compounds targets the response regulator protein BfmR from A. baumannii. BfmR has been shown to be a master controller of biofilm formation in A. baumannii13.</p><p>Response regulators constitute one half of the bacterial communication module known as a two-component system. Two-component systems enable bacteria to sense and respond to changes in environmental conditions. They characteristically consist of a membrane-bound histidine kinase that senses a specific environmental stimulus and a matching response regulator that mediates the bacterial response, typically through differential expression of target genes14. In addition to providing environmental surveillance, two-component systems are essential elements of the virulence and antibiotic resistance responses of opportunistic bacterial pathogens15,16. Not surprisingly they have long been considered an ideal therapeutic target in the infectious disease community. So far, nearly all therapeutic efforts have focused on affecting the histidine kinases17–20. A recent virtual screening approach was used to design molecules that affect the response regulator PhoP binding DNA, but no in vivo or clinical studies have been reported21.</p><p>The 2AI compound used in this study (2AI-1) is shown in Fig. 1a. This molecule has demonstrated great efficacy in affecting A. baumannii in both its biofilm and planktonic states12,22.23.</p><p>Our first goal was to determine whether 2AI-1 was able to cross both A. baumannii cell membranes and enter the cytoplasm. To do this we used a fluorescein-labeled analog of 2AI-1 and confocal laser scanning microscopy or CLSM (Supporting Information). Prior to applying the 2AI-1 analog, we used 'impermeable' octadecyl-rhodamine B (ORB) to establish a negative control24. The ORB fluorophore binds to the environmentally exposed surface of the outer membrane and cannot cross into the cell. When viewed using CLSM, the ORB-treated cells exhibit a red halo that outlines the cells surface (Fig. 1b). After establishing this control, A. baumannii bacteria were treated with 100 µM of the 2AI-1 fluorescein analog, and live samples were viewed after a 30-minute incubation. The fluorescein signal in the live A. baumannii sample was uniformly distributed throughout the cells with the appearance of hotspots just within the cellular boundary, confirming that 2AI-1 was able to permeate the membrane barriers (Fig. 1c). In addition to live samples, formaldehyde-fixed samples were made from the analog treated cultures. These samples revealed that the analog could be crosslinked, due to the free amine moiety on the 2AI ring, within the cellular membranes and internal hotspots, especially near septa (Fig. 1d), supporting the membrane permeability of the molecule.</p><p>Next we determined a biological target for 2AI-1. Unlike for typical antibiotics, 2AI mechanistic studies are hampered by the fact that the compounds exert their biological control through a non-microbicidal mechanism. Consequently, there is no underlying evolutionary basis allowing the bacteria to evolve resistance traits and hence to deliver mutants to be sequenced. Indeed, we have attempted to employ antibiotics as adjuvants to induce bacterial stress and generate mutants that are resistant to the effects of our 2AI derivatives. To date this approach has proved fruitless11. Given this restraint, we elected to identify potential protein targets directly using a pull-down strategy in conjunction with mass spectrometry. In these studies we employed A. baumannii bacterial lysate and a functionally active biotinylated analog of 2AI-1. The compound 2AI-1 falls under our \\"reverse amide\\" class of anti-biofilm agents22,25 and we have previously shown that the tertiary amide analogue 2AI-2 is an active anti-biofilm agent against A. baumannii23. In addition, further functionalization of the alkyne via click chemistry does not erode activity. Therefore, we chose to pursue conjugation to biotin via the alkyne linker. The resulting biotinylated analog, 2AI-3, showed expected activity against A. baumannii biofilms (Supporting Information). From these pull-down experiments and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis, we readily identified that the 2AI-1 biotinylated analog extracted the response regulator BfmR (Supporting Information). This interaction was confirmed using the anti-BfmR antibody for visualization. Here the pull-down experiment was repeated using (i) lysate and (ii) purified, recombinantly expressed BfmR. The antibody indicated the major protein band that bound 2AI-1 was BfmR in the lysate as well as the purified protein. In Fig. 2 a western blot illustrates a biotynilated analog of 2AI-1 used with magnetic strepavidin beads in a pull down assay, to confirm binding to the BfmR protein in A. baumannii lysate and recombinantly expressed BfmR.</p><p>Lane 1 shows lysate from A. baumannii after being exposed to the BfmR antibody. Lane 2 shows BfmR that was bound from the lysate by the 2AI-1 analog and exposed to the BfmR antibody. As a control, recombinantly expressed BfmR (Lane 5) was used in an identical pull down. Lanes 6, 7 and 8 show the recombinant protein bound the 2AI-1 analog. Subsequently fluorescence spectroscopy also corroborated that 2AI-1 bound to purified BfmR.</p><p>Like the majority of response regulators, BfmR has two domains: an N-terminal phosphporylation domain and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain. To determine which domain 2AI-1 interacts with, we performed further pull-down experiments using biotinylated 2AI-1 with BfmRN (N-terminal BfmR, residues 1–129) and BfmRC (C-terminal BfmR, residues 129–238). These experiments showed that 2AI-1 bound to both BfmRN and BfmRC (Supporting Information). This suggests that 2AI-1 compound contacts both domains when binding to the full-length protein and may reside at the inter-domain interface.</p><p>Subsequently, we performed computational docking for BfmR and 2AI-1. The high homology between response regulators allows for realistic structural models to be generated26. The goal was to locate a general region on BfmR where 2AI-1 might preferentially bind (i.e. with the lowest energy) and whether this location supported the pull-down data. The BfmR model was based on the high-resolution PhoP structure (PDB 3ROJ)27. Like BfmR, PhoP is a member of the OmpR response regulator family. It was chosen as the optimum structural template for BfmR because (i) its structure is available, (ii) its secondary structure prediction is very similar to BfmR and (iii) the linker region between the N- and C-terminal domains is of comparable length, suggesting similar tethering. Using AutoDock (MGLTools), so-called 'blind/unbiased molecular docking' was performed, using standard docking and scoring parameters, except for the degree of exhaustiveness (=100)28. The search space comprised the entire target PDB so that no regional biasing was evident. The docking calculations show that 2AI-1 preferentially targets the interface between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains in BfmR, with 70% of the interactions computed found to reside in the inter-domain interface. Figure 3 shows the lowest energy binding solutions for 2AI-1 binding to the BfmR model. Contacts are made between 2AI-1 and both domains.</p><p>These studies strongly support the pull-down experiments and bolster the proposition that 2AI-1 targets BfmR in such a way as to directly affect both the N-terminal regulatory domain and the C-terminal DNA-binding domain.</p><p>Finally, in order to see whether 2AI-1 has any broad preference for response regulators, we performed more pull-down experiments with the following response regulators/domains: Spo0A, Spo0AN (Spo0A N-terminal domain), Spo0AC (Spo0A C-terminal domain), ComAN (ComA N-terminal domain), ComAC (ComA C-terminal domain), Spo0F and CheY (response regulators consisting of just a regulatory domain). In each case, binding between the 2AI-1 analog and the protein/domain was observed. Pull-down negative controls were also run. The following 'all helical' proteins were employed: VanU, LuxU, SinI and SinRN. For each, no binding was seen between the 2AI-1 analog and the protein. These studies suggest that 2AI-1 preferentially targets response regulators.</p><p>Here, we established that the response regulator BfmR from the opportunistic human pathogen A. baumannii is a target for the 2-aminoimidazole compound 2AI-1. BfmR controls biofilm development in A. baumannii and 2AI-1 inhibits biofilm formation. Pull-down experiments show that 2AI-1 binds to both the regulatory and output domains of BfmR and computational docking suggests that the putative site for interaction is at the inter-domain interface. 2AI-1 shows general targeting preference for response regulators and is able to permeate the cell membrane. As noted, there has been great interest in controlling the action of two-component systems for therapeutic advantage29,30. Here we suggest that a family of 2-aminoimidazole compounds target response regulators in such a way that two-component system function is hindered and the ability of bacteria to protect themselves is impeded. This allows for the possibility of using our 2AI molecules as adjuvants to existing (or new) antimicrobial treatments.</p><p>          ASSOCIATED CONTENT</p><p>          Supporting Information</p><p>Materials and methods for confocal microscopy, pull-down experiments and docking.

oxidation , and sulfoxidation .  the studies reported in this communication were performed with the objective of finding a convenient rich source of peroxidase which could be tested for the above organic biotransformations . we have found that aegyptiaca fruit juice is a novel good source of peroxidase .the enzymatic properties of peroxidase of l. aegyptiaca fruit juice have been reported in this communication .louis usa . all other chemicals used in these investigations were either from himedia laboratory ltd , mumbai or from e. merck ( india ) ltd . , mumbai , and were used without further purifications .the enzyme was isolated by cutting the l. aegyptiaca fruit into the small pieces , crushing the pieces in mortar with pestle , and extracting the juice by keeping the pieces in four layers of cheese cloth and squeezing it .the juice was centrifuged using sigma ( germany ) model 3  k-30 refrigerated centrifuge at 4000  g for 20  min at 4c to remove the cloudiness of the juice .peroxidase activity of the enzyme was measured in 1  ml reaction solution containing 50  mm sodium phosphate buffer ph 7.0 at 30c using 5  mm guaiacol , 0.6  mm hydrogen peroxide as the substrates and by monitoring the absorbance changes at  = 470  nm using molar extinction coefficient value of 2.66  10  m  cm for the product tetraguaiacol formed by the enzymatic reaction [ 28 , 29 ] .the reaction solution was allowed for thermal equilibration for 10 minutes , 10  l of the enzyme stock 180  iu / ml was added , and activity measurement was started immediately and was continued for 180 seconds .all spectrophotometric measurements were done with uv / vis spectrophotometer hitachi ( japan ) model u-2000 which was fitted with electronic temperature control unit for variation of temperature in the cuvettes .the least count of the absorbance measurement was 0.001 , and one enzyme unit is the amount of enzyme which produces 1  mol / min of the product .the steady state kinetics of the enzyme was studied using guaiacol and h2o2 as the variable substrates and monitoring the steady state formation of tetraguaiacol as mentioned in the assay section . while varying the concentration of guaiacol , the concentration of h2o2 was fixed at enzyme saturating value 0.6  mm .similarly , while varying the concentration of h2o2 , the concentration of guaiacol was fixed at the enzyme saturating value 5  mm .the km values were calculated using linear regression analysis of the data points of double - reciprocal plots .each point of steady state velocity was an average of triplicate measurements , and the percentage standard deviation was less than 5% .  the ph optimum was determined by measuring the relative activity of the enzyme in the ph range 2.59.0 using buffer prepared with h3po4/nah2po4/na2hpo4 .the composition of the reaction solution was the same as mentioned in the peroxidase activity assay .the temperature optimum was determined by measuring the relative activity of the enzyme in the temperature range 2080c at fixed ph 7.0 and using the reaction solution of the composition mentioned in peroxidase activity assay . before each measurement , the reaction mixture in the spectrophotometer cuvette was allowed for 10  min for temperature equilibration , the reaction was initiated by the addition of 10  l , of concentrated enzyme stock having 180  iu / ml , and the activity was measured immediately .the effect of sodium azide on the activity of the enzyme was studied by monitoring the steady -

menten kinetics .the michaelis - menten and double - reciprocal plots using hydrogen peroxide as the variable substrate at the fixed enzyme saturating concentration of guaiacol ( 5  mm ) are shown in figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) , respectively .the correlation factor for the points on the double - reciprocal plot figure 2(b ) is 0.9864 .  the calculated km values for guaiacol and hydrogen peroxide were 2.0  mm and 0.2  mm , respectively .the corresponding values of km for horseradish peroxidase , turkish black radish , and solanum melongena fruit juice   were 0.8  mm and 0.1  mm , 36.0  m , and 8.4  m , and 6.5  mm and 0.33  mm , respectively .the reported enzyme has lower affinity for both the substrates than the peroxidases of horseradish peroxidase and turkish black radish ( raphanus sativus l. ) but higher affinity for both the substrates as compared to the peroxidase of s.   melongena fruit juice .  since peroxidases are known to follow double displacement type kinetics , l. aegyptiaca fruit juice peroxidase was also analysed for this type of kinetics by measuring the steady state velocity of the enzyme - catalysed reaction at three different fixed concentrations of the hydrogen peroxide and varying the concentration of guaiacol at each hydrogen peroxide concentration and also at three different fixed concentrations of guaiacol and varying the concentration of hydrogen peroxide .double reciprocal plots ( not shown here ) in both cases have been found to be parallel straight lines confirming that the reported peroxidase also follows double displacement type mechanism observed in case of other peroxidases . in order to use the reported peroxidase under optimal conditions of ph and temperature ,the dependence of the enzyme activities on the ph and temperature of the reaction solutions were studied .the enzyme had ph optimum at 6.5 and showed more than half of the maximum activity in the ph range 4.0 to 9.5 .plant peroxidases of s. melongena fruit juice   and musa paradisiaca stem juice   have been studied in our laboratory .the ph optima of the peroxidases from these sources have been found to be 5.5 and 4.5 ph units , respectively .thus the reported peroxidase can be used effectively near neutral ph , whereas the other two peroxidases have ph optima in more acidic regions .the temperature optima of the peroxidases from s. melongena fruit juice   and m. paradisiacal stem juice , the other two plant peroxidases reported from our laboratory , were 84c and 62.5c respectively .thus the peroxidase from l. aegyptiaca fruit juice has the temperature optimum on the higher temperature side as in the cases of peroxidases from s. melongena fruit juice   and m. paradisiacal stem juice .the effect of sodium azide which is known to inhibit peroxidase activity   was also studied on the activity of l. aegyptiaca fruit juice peroxidase .the concentration of sodium azide needed to reduce the relative activity of the enzyme to half of its initial value is 20  mm . in order to decide the nature of inhibition ,double - reciprocal plots were drawn in the presence of different fixed concentrations of sodium azide inhibitor and varying the concentration of guaiacol .the nature of inhibition was competitive , because the intercepts on y - axis was independent of the inhibitor concentration .the competitive inhibition suggests that the inhibitor competes for the binding of guaiacol substrate to the enzyme .during the last decades , peroxidases have emerged as good biocatalysts for the variety of organic biotransformation reactions like hydroxylation of arenes , the oxyfunctionalization of phenols and aromatic amines , the epoxidation and halogenation of olefins , the oxygenation of hetero atoms , and the enantioselective reduction of racemic hydroperoxides .this short communication reports a convenient and rich source of a peroxidase which can be used for the above transformations .","answer":"peroxidases have turned out to be potential biocatalyst for a variety of organic reactions .  the research work reported in this communication was done with the objective of finding a convenient rich source of peroxidase which could be used as a biocatalyst for organic synthetic reactions .  the studies made have shown that luffa aegyptiaca ( gourd ) fruit juice contains peroxidase activity of the order of 180 enzyme unit / ml .  the km values of this peroxidase for the substrates guaiacol and hydrogen peroxide were 2.0 and 0.2  mm , respectively .  the ph and temperature optima were 6.5 and 60c , respectively .  like other peroxidases , it followed double displacement type mechanism .  sodium azide inhibited the enzyme competitively with ki value of 3.35  mm ."},{"question":"You will be shown sections from a scientific research paper, together with a question about the paper.

First, the standard metrics for style accuracy and semantics preservation vary significantly on different re-runs. Therefore one has to report error margins for the obtained results. Second, starting with certain values of bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) between input and output and accuracy of the sentiment transfer the optimization of these two standard metrics diverge from the intuitive goal of the style transfer task. Finally, due to the nature of the task itself, there is a specific dependence between these two metrics that could be easily manipulated. Under these circumstances, we suggest taking BLEU between input and human-written reformulations into consideration for benchmarks. We also propose three new architectures that outperform state of the art in terms of this metric.IntroductionDeep generative models attract a lot of attention in recent years BIBREF0. Such methods as variational autoencoders BIBREF1 or generative adversarial networks BIBREF2 are successfully applied to a variety of machine vision problems including image generation BIBREF3, learning interpretable image representations BIBREF4 and style transfer for images BIBREF5. However, natural language generation is more challenging due to many reasons, such as the discrete nature of textual information BIBREF6, the absence of local information continuity and non-smooth disentangled representations BIBREF7. Due to these difficulties, text generation is mostly limited to specific narrow applications and is usually working in supervised settings.Content and style are deeply fused in natural language, but style transfer for texts is often addressed in the context of disentangled latent representations BIBREF6, BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10, BIBREF11, BIBREF12. Intuitive understanding of this problem is apparent: if an input text has some attribute A, a system generates new text similar to the input on a given set of attributes with only one attribute A changed to the target attribute tilde{A}. In the majority of previous works, style transfer is obtained through an encoder-decoder architecture with one or multiple style discriminators to learn disentangled representations. The encoder takes a sentence as an input and generates a style-independent content representation. The decoder then takes the content representation and the target style representation to generate the transformed sentence. In BIBREF13 authors question the quality and usability of the disentangled representations for texts and suggest an end-to-end approach to style transfer similar to an end-to-end machine translation.Contribution of this paper is three-fold: 1) we show that different style transfer architectures have varying results on test and that reporting error margins for various training re-runs of the same model is especially important for adequate assessment of the models accuracy, see Figure FIGREF1; 2) we show that BLEU BIBREF14 between input and output and accuracy of style transfer measured in terms of the accuracy of a pre-trained external style classifier can be manipulated and naturally diverge from the intuitive goal of the style transfer task starting from a certain threshold; 3) new architectures that perform style transfer using improved latent representations are shown to outperform state of the art in terms of BLEU between output and human-written reformulations.Style transferIn this work we experiment with extensions of a model, described in BIBREF6, using Texar BIBREF40 framework. To generate plausible sentences with specific semantic and stylistic features every sentence is conditioned on a representation vector z which is concatenated with a particular code c that specifies desired attribute, see Figure FIGREF8. Under notation introduced in BIBREF6 the base autoencoder (AE) includes a conditional probabilistic encoder E defined with parameters theta _E to infer the latent representation z given input xGenerator G defined with parameters theta _G is a GRU-RNN for generating and output hat{x} defined as a sequence of tokens hat{x} = {hat{x}_1, ..., hat{x}_T} conditioned on the latent representation z and a stylistic component c that are concatenated and give rise to a generative distributionThese encoder and generator form an AE with the following lossThis standard reconstruction loss that drives the generator to produce realistic sentences is combined with two additional losses. The first discriminator provides extra learning signals which enforce the generator to produce coherent attributes that match the structured code in c. Since it is impossible to propagate gradients from the discriminator through the discrete sample hat{x}, we use a deterministic continuous approximation a \\"soft\\" generated sentence, denoted as tilde{G} = tilde{G}_tau (z, c) with \\"temperature\\" tau  set to tau rightarrow 0 as training proceeds. The resulting “soft” generated sentence is fed into the discriminator to measure the fitness to the target attribute, leading to the following lossFinally, under the assumption that each structured attribute of generated sentences is controlled through the corresponding code in c and is independent from z one would like to control that other not explicitly modelled attributes do not entangle with c. This is addressed by the dedicated lossThe training objective for the baseline, shown in Figure FIGREF8, is therefore a sum of the losses from Equations (DISPLAY_FORM4) – (DISPLAY_FORM6) defined aswhere lambda _c and lambda _z are balancing parameters.Let us propose two further extensions of this baseline architecture. To improve reproducibility of the research the code of the studied models is open. Both extensions aim to improve the quality of information decomposition within the latent representation. In the first one, shown in Figure FIGREF12, a special dedicated discriminator is added to the model to control that the latent representation does not contain stylistic information. The loss of this discriminator is defined asHere a discriminator denoted as D_z is trying to predict code c using representation z. Combining the loss defined by Equation (DISPLAY_FORM7) with the adversarial component defined in Equation (DISPLAY_FORM10) the following learning objective is formedwhere mathcal {L}_{baseline} is a sum defined in Equation (DISPLAY_FORM7), lambda _{D_z} is a balancing parameter.The second extension of the baseline architecture does not use an adversarial component D_z that is trying to eradicate information on c from component z. Instead, the system, shown in Figure FIGREF16 feeds the \\"soft\\" generated sentence tilde{G} into encoder E and checks how close is the representation E(tilde{G} ) to the original representation z = E(x) in terms of the cosine distance. We further refer to it as shifted autoencoder or SAE. Ideally, both E(tilde{G} (E(x), c)) and E(tilde{G} (E(x), bar{c})), where bar{c} denotes an inverse style code, should be both equal to E(x). The loss of the shifted autoencoder iswhere lambda _{cos} and lambda _{cos^{-}} are two balancing parameters, with two additional terms in the loss, namely, cosine distances between the softened output processed by the encoder and the encoded original input, defined asWe also study a combination of both approaches described above, shown on Figure FIGREF17.In Section SECREF4 we describe a series of experiments that we have carried out for these architectures using Yelp! reviews dataset.Experiments ::: Error margins matterOn Figure FIGREF1 one can see that the outcomes for every single rerun differ significantly. Namely, accuracy can change up to 5 percentage points, whereas BLEU can vary up to 8 points. This variance can be partially explained with the stochasticity incurred due to sampling from the latent variables. However, we show that results for state of the art models sometimes end up within error margins from one another, so one has to report the margins to compare the results rigorously. More importantly, one can see that there is an inherent trade-off between these two performance metrics. This trade-off is not only visible across models but is also present for the same retrained architecture. Therefore, improving one of the two metrics is not enough to confidently state that one system solves the style-transfer problem better than the other. One has to report error margins after several consecutive retrains and instead of comparing one of the two metrics has to talk about Pareto-like optimization that would show confident improvement of both.To put obtained results into perspective, we have retrained every model from scratch five times in a row. We have also retrained the models of BIBREF12 five times since their code is published online. Figure FIGREF19 shows the results of all models with error margins. It is also enhanced with other self-reported results on the same Yelp! review dataset for which no code was published.One can see that error margins of the models, for which several reruns could be performed, overlap significantly. In the next subsection, we carefully study BLEU and accuracy of the external classifier and discuss their aptness to measure style transfer performance.ConclusionStyle transfer is not a rigorously defined NLP problem. Starting from definitions of style and semantics and finishing with metrics that could be used to evaluate the performance of a proposed system. There is a surge of recent contributions that work on this problem. This paper highlights several issues connected with this lack of rigor. First, it shows that the state of the art algorithms are inherently noisy on the two most widely accepted metrics, namely, BLEU between input and output and accuracy of the external style classifier. This noise can be partially attributed to the adversarial components that are often used in the state of the art architectures and partly due to certain methodological inconsistencies in the assessment of the performance. Second, it shows that reporting error margins of several consecutive retrains for the same model is crucial for the comparison of different architectures, since error margins for some of the models overlap significantly. Finally, it demonstrates that even BLEU on human-written reformulations can be manipulated in a relatively simple way.Supplemental MaterialHere are some examples characteristic for different systems.

Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2), a protein involved in cell transformation, interferes with the cellular response to type I interferons (IFN-alpha / beta). We investigated the function of conditionally expressed EBNA2 in the context of the IFN response in Burkitt 's lymphoma cell lines. Expression of EBNA2 led to the transcriptional activation of both endogenous or transfected IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), genes which contain within their promoters either the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) or the gamma interferon activation site (GAS). In search of a molecular mechanism for the transcriptional induction of ISGs, we observed an EBNA2-dependent synthesis of IFN-beta mRNA at low levels and the secretion of low amounts of IFN. A transfected IFN-beta promoter responded to EBNA2 activation, and a sequence closely resembling a RBP-Jkappa binding site was pinpointed as a potential target of EBNA2 activity. EBNA2-dependent transcriptional induction of the IFN-beta promoter occurred in EBV-negative Burkitt 's lymphoma cells, indicating that other EBV genes were not required for the induction of IFN-beta synthesis.","answer":"{\\"CellLine\\": [\\"EBV - negative Burkitt u0027s lymphoma cells\\", \\"Burkitt u0027s lymphoma cell lines\\"], \\"CellType\\": [\\"B lymphocyte\\"], \\"DNA\\": [\\"EBV genes\\", \\"RBP - Jkappa binding site\\", \\"gamma interferon activation site\\", \\"interferon - stimulated response element\\", \\"GAS\\", \\"IFN - beta promoter\\", \\"ISRE\\", \\"promoters\\", \\"IFN - stimulated genes\\", \\"ISGs\\"], \\"Protein\\": [\\"Epstein - Barr virus nuclear antigen 2\\", \\"EBNA2\\", \\"IFN\\", \\"IFN - alpha / beta\\", \\"type I interferon\\", \\"IFN - beta\\", \\"type I interferons\\"], \\"RNA\\": []}"},{"question":"Below are the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of a computer science research paper.

between events is irrelevant and the distance between events is simply the difference between their order positions in the sequence.While this time-independent view of sequences is applicable for data such as natural languages, e.g., dealing with words in a sentence, it is inappropriate and inefficient for many real world events that are observed and collected at unequally spaced points of time as they naturally arise, e.g., when a person goes to a grocery store or makes a phone call.The time span between events can carry important information about the sequence dependence of human behaviors.In this work, we propose a set of methods for using time in sequence prediction.Because neural sequence models such as RNN are more amenable for handling token-like input, we propose two methods for time-dependent event representation, based on the intuition on how time is tokenized in everyday life and previous work on embedding contextualization.We also introduce two methods for using next event duration as regularization for training a sequence prediction model.We discuss these methods based on recurrent neural nets.We evaluate these methods as well as baseline models on five datasets that resemble a variety of sequence prediction tasks.The experiments revealed that the proposed methods offer accuracy gain over baseline models in a range of settings.Event sequence prediction is a task to predict the next event 1 based on a sequence of previously occurred events.Event sequence prediction has a broad range of applications, e.g., next word prediction in language modeling BID10 , next place prediction based on the previously visited places, or next app to launch given the usage history.Depending on how the temporal information is modeled, event sequence prediction often decomposes into the following two categories: discrete-time event sequence prediction and continuous-time event sequence prediction.Discrete-time event sequence prediction primarily deals with sequences that consist of a series of tokens (events) where each token can be indexed by its order position in the sequence.Thus such a sequence evolves synchronously in natural unit-time steps.These sequences are either inherently time-independent, e.g, each word in a sentence, or resulted from sampling a sequential behavior at an equally-spaced point in time, e.g., busy or not busy for an hourly traffic update.In a discrete-time event sequence, the distance between events is measured as the difference of their order positions.As a consequence, for discrete-time event sequence modeling, the primary goal is to predict what event will happen next.Continuous-time event sequence prediction mainly attends to the sequences where the events occur asynchronously.For example, the time interval between consecutive clinical visits of a patient may potentially vary largely.The duration between consecutive log-in events into an online service can change from time to time.Therefore, one primary goal of continuous-time event sequence prediction is to predict when the next event will happen in the near future.Although these two tasks focus on different aspects of a future event, how to learn a proper representation for the temporal information in the past is crucial to both of them.More specifically, even though for a few discrete-time event sequence prediction tasks (e.g., neural machine translation), they do not involve an explicit temporal information for each event (token), a proper representation of the position in the sequence is still of great importance, not to mention the more general cases where each event is particularly associated with a timestamp.For example, the next destination people want to go to often depends on what other places they have gone to and how long they have stayed in each place in the past.When the next clinical visit BID3 will occur for a patient depends on the time of the most recent visits and the respective duration between them.Therefore, the temporal information of events and the interval between them are crucial to the event sequence prediction in general.However, how to effectively use and represent time in sequence prediction still largely remains under explored.A natural and straightforward solution is to bring time as an additional input into an existing sequence model (e.g., recurrent neural networks).However, it is notoriously challenging for recurrent neural networks to directly handle continuous input that has a wide value range, as what is shown in our experiments.Alternatively, we are inspired by the fact that humans are very good at characterizing time span as high-level concepts.For example, we would say \\"watching TV for a little while\\" instead of using the exact minutes and seconds to describe the duration.We also notice that these high-level descriptions about time are event dependent.For example, watching movies for 30 minutes might feel much shorter than waiting in the line for the same amount of time.Thus, it is desirable to learn and incorporate these time-dependent event representations in general.Our paper offers the following contributions:• We propose two methods for time-dependent event representation in a neural sequence prediction model: time masking of event embedding and event-time joint embedding.We use the time span associated with an event to better characterize the event by manipulating its embedding to give a recurrent model additional resolving power for sequence prediction.•We propose to use next event duration as a regularizer for training a recurrent sequence prediction model. Specifically, we define two flavors of duration-based regularization: one is based on the negative log likelihood of duration prediction error and the other measures the cross entropy loss of duration prediction in a projected categorical space.• We evaluatedthese proposed methods as well as several baseline methods on five datasets (four are public). These datasetsspan a diverse range of sequence behaviors, including mobile app usage, song listening pattern, and medical history. The baseline methodsinclude vanilla RNN models and those found in the recent literature. These experiments offervaluable findings about how these methods improve prediction accuracy in a variety of settings.We proposed a set of methods for leveraging the temporal information for event sequence prediction.Based on our intuition about how humans tokenize time spans as well as previous work on contextual representation of words, we proposed two methods for time-dependent event representation.They transform a regular event embedding with learned time masking and form time-event joint embedding based on learned soft one-hot encoding.We also introduced two methods for using next duration as a way of regularization for training a sequence prediction model.Experiments on a diverse range of real data demonstrate consistent performance gain by blending time into the event representation before it is fed to a recurrent neural network.","answer":"Proposed methods for time-dependent event representation and regularization for sequence prediction; Evaluated these methods on five datasets that involve a range of sequence prediction tasks."},{"question":"You will be shown an abstract from a biomedical research paper.

An analysis of current evidence. This article reviews current data on the use of cognition enhancers as study aids in the student population. It identifies gaps and uncertainties in the knowledge required to make a balanced assessment of the need for some form of regulation. The review highlights the weak evidence on the prevalence of use of such drugs, especially outside the US, and the ambiguous evidence for their efficacy in a healthy population. Risks are well documented for the commonly used drugs, but poorly appreciated by users. These include not only the side-effects of the drugs themselves, but risks associated with on-line purchase, which offers no guarantees of authenticity and which for some drugs is illegal. The case for urgent action to regulate use is often linked to the belief that new and more effective drugs are likely to appear in the near future. The evidence for this is weak. However, drugs are not the only possible route to neuroenhancement and action is needed to collect more data on the impact of existing drugs, as well as new technologies, in order to guide society in making a proportionate response to the issue.

As has become known, most materials, such as proteins and DNA, show orientation under strong magnetic fields. However, the critical threshold for the magnetic field of the magnetomechanical phenomena is still unknown. We demonstrate that a thin micro-mirror from a fish scale with high reflectivity exhibits a distinct magnetic response at 100 mT. A dramatic event under a magnetic field is the decrease of light scattering from guanine crystals as well as rapid rotation against the applied magnetic field. Enhancement of light scattering intensity is also observed when the three vectors of light incidence, magnetic field, and observation are orthogonally directed. The results indicate that biogenic guanine crystals have a large diamagnetic anisotropy along the surface parallel and normal directions. The micrometer to submicrometer scale of thin biogenic plates can act as a noninvasively, magnetically controlled micro-mirror for light irradiation control in the micrometer-scale region.","answer":"{\\"Chemical\\": [\\"guanine\\"]}"},{"question":"You will be shown inclusion or exclusion criteria for a clinical trial.

Chapter Title:  A. Localization and tracking based on the expectationmaximization procedure 1. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB001):  Suppose x is an unknown vector in Ropfm (a digital image or signal); we plan to measure n general linear functionals of x and then reconstruct. If x is known to be compressible by transform coding with a known transform, and we reconstruct via the nonlinear procedure defined here, the number of measurements n can be dramatically smaller than the size m. Thus, certain natural classes of images with m pixels need only n=O(m1/4log5/2(m)) nonadaptive nonpixel samples for faithful recovery, as opposed to the usual m pixel samples. More specifically, suppose x has a sparse representation in some orthonormal basis (e.g., wavelet, Fourier) or tight frame (e.g., curvelet, Gabor)-so the coefficients belong to an lscrp ball for 0<ples1. The N most important coefficients in that expansion allow reconstruction with lscr2 error O(N1/2-1p/). It is possible to design n=O(Nlog(m)) nonadaptive measurements allowing reconstruction with accuracy comparable to that attainable with direct knowledge of the N most important coefficients. Moreover, a good approximation to those N important coefficients is extracted from the n measurements by solving a linear program-Basis Pursuit in signal processing. The nonadaptive measurements have the character of \\"random\\" linear combinations of basis/frame elements. Our results use the notions of optimal recovery, of n-widths, and information-based complexity. We estimate the Gel'fand n-widths of lscrp balls in high-dimensional Euclidean space in the case 0<ples1, and give a criterion identifying near- optimal subspaces for Gel'fand n-widths. We show that \\"most\\" subspaces are near-optimal, and show that convex optimization (Basis Pursuit) is a near-optimal way to extract information derived from these near-optimal subspaces 2. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB002):  The problem of distributed localization for ad hoc wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) is addressed in this paper. WASNs are characterized by low computational resources in each node and by limited connectivity between the nodes. Novel bi-directional tree-based distributed estimation--maximization (DEM) algorithms are proposed to circumvent these inherent limitations. We show that the proposed algorithms are capable of localizing static acoustic sources in reverberant enclosures without a priori information on the number of sources. Unlike serial estimation procedures (like ring-based algorithms), the new algorithms enable simultaneous computations in the nodes and exhibit greater robustness to communication failures. Specifically, the recursive distributed EM (RDEM) variant is better suited to online applications due to its recursive nature. Furthermore, the RDEM outperforms the other proposed variants in terms of convergence speed and simplicity. Performance is demonstrated by an extensive experimental study consisting of both simulated and actual environments. 3. Abstract of Cited Paper (BIB003):  Localization of acoustic sources has attracted a considerable amount of research attention in recent years. A major obstacle to achieving high localization accuracy is the presence of reverberation, the influence of which obviously increases with the number of active speakers in the room. Human hearing is capable of localizing acoustic sources even in extreme conditions. In this study, we propose to combine a method based on human hearing mechanisms and a modified incremental distributed expectation-maximization (IDEM) algorithm. Rather than using phase difference measurements that are modeled by a mixture of complex-valued Gaussians, as proposed in the original IDEM framework, we propose to use time difference of arrival measurements in multiple subbands and model them by a mixture of real-valued truncated Gaussians. Moreover, we propose to first filter the measurements in order to reduce the effect of the multipath conditions. The proposed method is evaluated using both simulated data and real-life recordings.Literature Review:","answer":"In this section we review an unsupervised methodology for speaker localization and tracking of unknown number of concurrent speakers in noisy and reverberant enclosures, using spatially distributed microphone array. We cast the localization problem as a classification problem in which the measurements (or features extracted thereof) can be associated with a grid of candidate positions 118 P = {p 1 , . . . , p M }, where M = |P| is the number of candidates. The actual number of speakers is always significantly lower than M . The speech signals, together with an additive noise, are captured by an array of N microphones (binaural setting was presented in 118 ). We assume a simple sound propagation model with a dominant direct-path and potentially a spatially-diffused reverberation tail. The nth microphone signal in the STFT domain is given by: where t = 0, . . . , T − 1 is the time index, k = 0, . . . , K − 1 is the frequency index, g m,n (k) is the direct-path transfer function from the speaker at the m-th position to the nth microphone: where T s is the sampling period, and τ m,n = pm−pn c is the TDOA between candidate position p m and microphone position p m and c the sound velocity. This TDOA can be calculated in advance from the predefined grid points and the array constellation. s m (t, k) is the speech signal uttered by a speaker at grid point m and v n (t, k) is either an ambient noise or the spatially-diffused reverberation tail. The indicator signal d m (t, k) indicates whether speaker m is active in the (t, k)-th STFT bin: (61) Note that, according to the sparsity assumption 119 the vector d(t, k) = vec m {d m (t, k)} ∈ {e 1 , . . . , e M }, where vec m {·} is a concatenation of the elements along the mth index and e m is a \\"one-hot\\" vector, namely equals '1' in its m-th entry, and zero elsewhere. The N microphone signals is concatenated in a vector form: where z(t, k), g m (k) and v(t, k) are the respective concatenated vectors. We will discuss several alternative feature vector selections from the raw data. Based on the W-disjoint orthogonality property of the speech signal 119,120 , these features can be attributed a GMM BIB002 , with each Gaussians associated with a candidate position in the enclosure on the predefined grid. An alternative is to organize the microphones in dual-microphone nodes and to extract the pair-wise relative phase ratio (PRP) with n the node index (number of microphones in this case is 2N ). Under the assumptions that 1) the microphone inter-distance is small compared with the distance of grid points from the node center, and 2) the reverberation level is low, the PRP of a signal impinging the microphones located at p 1 n and p 2 n from a grid point p m can be approximated bỹ (64) Since this approximation is often violated, we useφ k n (p m ) as the centroid of a Gaussian that describes the PRP. For multiple speakers in unknown positions we can use the W-disjoint orthogonality to express the distribution of the PRP as a GMM: We will also assume for simplicity that σ 2 is set in advance. Using the GMM, the localization task can be formulated as a maximum likelihood parameter estimation problem. The number of active speakers in the scene and their position will be indirectly determined by examining the GMM weights, π m , m = 1, . . . , M , and selecting their peak values. As explained above, the ML parameter estimation problem cannot be solved in closed-form. Instead, we will resort to the expectation-maximization (EM) procedure BIB001 The E-step results in the estimate of the indicator signal (here the hidden data): In the M-step the GMM weights are estimated: The procedure is repeated until a number of predefined iterations = L is reached. We refer to this procedure as batch EM, as opposed to the recursive and distributed variants that will be later introduced . In Fig. 15 a comparison between the classical SRP-PHAT and the batch EM is depicted. It is evident that the EM algorithm (which maximizes the ML criterion) achieves much higher resolution. In Ref. BIB003 , a distributed version of this algorithm was presented, suitable for wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) with known microphone positions. WASNs are characterized by low computational resources in each node and by a limited connectivity between the nodes. A bi-directional tree-based distributed EM (DEM) algorithm that circumvents the inherent network limitations was proposed, by substituting the standard EM iterations by iterations across nodes. Furthermore, a recursive distributed EM (RDEM) variant, which is better suited for online applications, is proposed. In Ref. BIB004 , an improved, bio-inspired, acoustic frontend that enhances the direct-path, and consequently increasing the robustness of the proposed schemes to high reverberation, is presented. An alternative method for enhancing the direct-path is presented in 124, where the multi-path propagation model of the sound is taken into account, by the so-called convolutive transfer function (CTF) model."},{"question":"You will be presented a sentence from biomedical research text.

We investigated the composition of essential oil from fingered citron (Citrus medica L. var. sarcodactylis) (FCEO) peels by GC-MS and its anti-inflammatory effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated mouse macrophage (RAW 264.7) cells. Fifteen compounds, representing 98.97% of the essential oil, were tentatively identified; the main constituents were limonene (52.44%) and γ-terpinene (28.41%). FCEO significantly inhibited nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by suppressing the protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX) -2, respectively. Additionally, FCEO suppressed the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL) -1β, and IL-6. FCEO attenuated LPS-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation via inhibition of inhibitor κB-α phosphorylation. Furthermore, FCEO blocked activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) but not that of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. These results indicate that FCEO inhibits LPS-stimulated inflammation by blocking the NF-κB, JNK, and ERK pathways in macrophages, and demonstrate that FCEO possesses anti-inflammatory properties.","answer":"[[\\"PGE2\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"cyclooxygenase (COX) -2\\"], [\\"nitric oxide\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"inducible nitric oxide synthase\\"], [\\"prostaglandin E2\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"cyclooxygenase (COX) -2\\"], [\\"nitric oxide\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"iNOS\\"], [\\"NO\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"iNOS\\"], [\\"NO\\", \\"INDIRECT-DOWNREGULATOR\\", \\"inducible nitric oxide synthase\\"]]"},{"question":"You will be presented with the abstract, introduction, and discussion section from a biomedical research article.

However, the genetic basis of sensitivity to anthracyclines remains unclear. We created a panel of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from 45 individuals and performed RNA-seq after 24 hr exposure to varying doxorubicin dosages. The transcriptomic response is substantial: the majority of genes are differentially expressed and over 6000 genes show evidence of differential splicing, the later driven by reduced splicing fidelity in the presence of doxorubicin. We show that inter-individual variation in transcriptional response is predictive of in vitro cell damage, which in turn is associated with in vivo ACT risk. We detect 447 response-expression quantitative trait loci( QTLs) and 42 response-splicing QTLs, which are enriched in lower ACT GWAS p-values, supporting the in vivo relevance of our map of genetic regulation of cellular response to anthracyclines.Introduction:Anthracyclines, including the prototypical doxorubicin, continue to be used as chemotherapeutic agents treating a wide range of cancers, particularly leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, breast cancer, and sarcoma. A well-known side-effect of doxorubicin treatment is anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity( ACT). For some patients ACT manifests as an asymptomatic reduction in cardiac function, as measured by left ventricular ejection fraction( LVEF), but in more extreme cases ACT can lead to congestive heart failure( CHF). The risk of CHF is dosage-dependent: an early study( Von Hoff et al., 1979) estimated 3% of patients at 400 mg/m2, 7% of patients at 550 mg/m2, and 18% of patients at 700 mg/m2 develop CHF, where a more recent study puts these numbers at 5%, 26% and 48% respectively( Swain et al., 2003). Reduced LVEF shows a similar dosage-dependent pattern, but is not fully predictive of CHF. Perhaps most daunting for patients is that CHF can occur years after treatment: out of 1807 cancer survivors followed for 7 years in a recent survey a third died of heart diseases compared to 51% of cancer recurrence( Vejpongsa and Yeh, 2014). Various candidate gene studies have attempted to find genetic determinants of ACT, but are plagued by small sample sizes and unclear endpoint definitions, resulting in limited replication between studies. Two ACT genome-wide association studies( GWAS) have been published( Aminkeng et al., 2015; Schneider et al., 2017). While neither found genome-wide significant associations using their discovery cohorts, both found one variant that they were able to replicate in independent cohorts. A nonsynonymous coding variant, rs2229774, in RARG( retinoic acid receptor γ) was found to be associated with pediatric ACT using a Canadian European discovery cohort of 280 patients( Aminkeng et al., 2015), and replicated in both a European( p=0. 004) and non-European cohort( p=1×10−4). Modest signal( p=0. 076) supporting rs2229774’s association with ACT was also reported in a recent study primarily focused on trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity( Serie et al., 2017). RARG negative cell lines have reduced retinoic acid response element( RAREs) activity and reduced suppression of Top2b( Aminkeng et al., 2015), which has been proposed as a mediator of ACT. In a different study, a GWAS in 845 patients with European-ancestry from a large adjuvant breast cancer clinical trial, 51 of whom developed CHF, found no variants at genome-wide significance levels( Schneider et al., 2017). However, one of the most promising variants, rs28714259( p=9×10−6 in discovery cohort), was genotyped in two further cohorts and showed modest replication( p=0. 04, 0. 018). rs28714259 falls in a glucocorticoid receptor protein binding peak, which may play a role in cardiac development. An exciting approach to studying complex phenotypes, including disease, in human is to use induced pluripotent stem cells( iPSC) and derived differentiated cells as in vitro model systems. Work by us and others has demonstrated that iPSCs and iPSC-derived cell-types are powerful model systems for understanding cell-type specific genetic regulation of transcription( Thomas et al., 2015; Burrows et al., 2016; Banovich et al., 2018; Kilpinen et al., 2017; Alasoo et al., 2017), but it is less established whether these systems can be used to model the interplay of genetic and environmental factors in disease progression. Encouragingly, the response of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes( ICs) to doxorubicin was recently extensively characterized( Burridge et al., 2016). ICs derived from four individuals who developed ACT after doxorubicin treatment( ‘DOXTOX’ group) and four who did not( ‘DOX’ group), showed clear differences in viability( via apoptosis), metabolism, DNA damage, oxidative stress and mitochondrial function when exposed to doxorubicin. These observations suggest that ICs recapitulate in vivo inter-individual differences in doxorubicin sensitivity. Gene expression response differences between the DOX and DOXTOX groups were found using RNA-sequencing data, but the sample size was insufficient( RNA-seq was generated for only three individuals in each group) to attempt mapping of genetic variants that might explain the observed functional differences between individuals. Here we used a panel of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from 45 individuals, exposed to five different drug concentrations, to map the genetic basis of inter-individual differences in doxorubicin-sensitivity. We find hundreds of genetics variants that modulate the transcriptomic response, including 42 that act on alternative splicing. We show that the IC transcriptomic response predicts cardiac troponin levels in culture( indicative of cell lysis) in these cell-lines, and that troponin level is itself predictive of ACT. Finally we demonstrate that the mapped genetic variants show significant enrichment in lower ACT GWAS p-values.Discussion:Human iPSC-derived somatic cells provide a powerful, renewable and reproducible tool for modeling cellular responses to external perturbation in vitro, especially for non-blood cell-types such as cardiomyocytes which are extremely challenging to collect and even then are typically only available post-mortem. We established a sufficiently large iPSC panel to effectively query the transcriptomic response of differentiated cardiomyocytes to doxorubicin. We were also able to characterize the role of genetic variation in modulating this response, both in terms of total expression and alternative splicing. There are, of course, caveats associated with using an in vitro system, which may not accurately represent certain aspects cardiac response to doxorubicin in vivo. That said, the replication of GTEx heart eQTLs, association of troponin levels with predicted ACT-risk( Burridge et al., 2016), and the observed GWAS enrichment, all support the notion that the IC system recapitulates substantial elements of in vivo biology. It is challenging to quantify this agreement, and there are in vivo factors that are certainly not represented. For example, excessive fibrosis may contribute to ACT( Cascales et al., 2013; Zhan et al., 2016; Farhad et al., 2016; Heck et al., 2017), although is unclear how substantial this contribution is as well as whether fibroblasts are directly activated by doxorubicin exposure or simply respond indirectly to cardiomyocyte damage. While our FACS analysis shows cardiomyocytes are the dominant cell type in our cultures, heterogeneity remains and other cell types could be mediating some of the observed changes. For many diseases such as ACT which involve an environmental perturbation it is reasonable to suppose that eQTLs detected at steady-state are only tangentially relevant when attempting to interpret disease variants. Such concerns motivated us to focus on response eQTLs, that is, variants that that have functional consequences under specific cellular conditions because they interact, directly or indirectly, with the treatment. We used a statistical definition of reQTLs corresponding to cases where gene expression levels are significantly better explained using a model including an interaction term between genotype and treatment( represented as a categorical variable), compared to a model with only additive effects for genotype and treatment. Our characterization of the detected reQTL demonstrates that these variants are indeed candidate drivers of differences in individual transcriptomic response to doxorubicin. The strongest reQTL effects correspond to completely different response patterns for the major and minor alleles, while weaker effects correspond to more subtle modulation of the same response pattern. We note that it is not necessarily the case that such reQTLs are the only functionally relevant eQTLs. eSNPs with a marginal( additive) effect on expression of a gene responsive to doxorubicin( as most genes are) could still be important if the relationship between expression and ACT-risk is nonlinear, for example involving thresholding effects. We observed a statistical enrichment of expression and( to a lesser extent) splicing QTLs in ACT GWAS. However, with no reproducible genome-wide significant associations available, fine-mapping of causal variants remains fraught. We anticipate our findings will be increasingly valuable as larger-scale ACT GWAS become available. We derived ICs from healthy individuals so we do not known which individuals would develop ACT if they required anthracycline treatment. Mapping molecular response QTLs in larger panels of ICs from patients treated with anthracyclines who do or do not develop ACT symptoms would allow stronger conclusions to be drawn about the contribution of the detected( r) eQTLs to disease etiology. We used a panel of Hutterites individual since this homogeneous population offers unique advantages for mapping genetic traits: exposure to a fairly uniform environment and less variable genetic background, despite still representing much of European diversity( Newman et al., 2004). However, the genetic basis of ACT susceptibility is likely complex and some relevant genetic variation may not be well represented in this cohort. Finally, an interesting observation in our study is that splicing fidelity is reduced upon doxorubicin exposure. This is not completely unexpected since a key downstream side-effect of doxorubicin is increased oxidative stress, which has been previously associated with dysregulated splicing of specific genes( Disher and Skandalis, 2007; Seo et al., 2016). Our finding that this effect is prevalent across the transcriptome poses further questions about what known effects of doxorubicin might, in fact, be mediated by changes in RNA splicing.","answer":"Many cancers , including leukaemia , lymphoma and breast cancer , are treated with potent chemotherapy drugs such as anthracyclines . However , anthracyclines have strong side effects known as anthracycline cardiotoxicity , which affect the health of the heart . Almost half of the patients given high doses of anthracyclines develop chronic heart failure . While anthracycline cardiotoxicity is very common , people’s genes may contribute to how sensitive they are to these drugs but it is not understood which genes can cause this effect . Previous studies using only a small number of participants have not been able to pin down the genetic factors that make some patients respond well to anthracyclines , and others prone to developing heart failure when taking these drugs . To find out which genes affect anthracycline cardiotoxicity , Knowles , Burrows et al . transformed blood cells from 45 individuals into stem cells , which were then developed into heart muscle cells . Then , the activity of genes was analyzed by measuring the amount of RNA ( the template molecules used to make proteins ) produced by those genes . After the cells had been exposed for 24 hours to the anthracycline drug doxorubicin , hundreds of gene activity differences could be found in the heart muscle cells between individuals . Some of these differences were linked to poorer health of the cells after treatment with the drug . As a result , a number of genetic variants that could predispose patients to the side effects of doxorubicin were discovered . The experiments also revealed how doxorubicin disrupts an important process that separates ‘junk’ parts of the RNA from the parts that are used as a template for proteins . Being able to predict who is likely to be sensitive to drugs such as doxorubicin could help doctors to tailor chemotherapy treatments more effectively , minimising the risk of heart failure . In future , larger studies could lead to accurate predictions of a patient’s response to a particular chemotherapy drug to personalize their cancer treatment ."},{"question":"You will be shown the title of a chemistry paper, together with sections excerpted from the body of the paper.

Increased demand for testing due to COVID-19 and limited commercial suppliers across the globe may exhaust supplies needed to perform the test. Hence, there is an urgent need for novel RNA extraction kits. One of the best and widely used methods for RNA extraction is by using silica-based materials. 1,2 By tuning the pH and salt concentration of the binding buffer, one can selectively adsorb RNA on to the silica surfaces. Efficient RNA extraction is often limited by silica chemistry and surface area that is able to bind and elute RNA.</p><p>In this method, the cells are first lysed to release RNA and this lysate mixture along with binding buffers is passed through or adsorbed on to the silica. RNA selectively binds to the silica surface while other components are washed out and the elution then yields pure RNA. 2 There are many commercial RNA extraction kits available, but the major limitations of these commercial kits are the cost and the lack of information regarding the silica column material.</p><p>In this work, we have shown the use of dendritic fibrous nanosilica (DFNS) for RNA extraction from cells and also studied the chemistry of interactions of RNA binding with silica. Our unique nano-silica, DFNS, attracted a great deal of attention in a large number of scientific disciplines. [3][4][5][6][7] DFNS based catalysts showed dramatically superior performance for a range of challenging processes, including solar energy harvesting (photocatalysis), CO 2 capture and conversion to fine chemicals and fuels. This was due to its unique fibrous morphology, highly accessible surface area, tunable pore size (fiber density) and pore volume, with controllable particle size (from nm to µm). Notably, more than 150 groups worldwide now use DFNS in a range of other fields. 4 DFNS allowed the loading and delivery of biological molecules such as DNA, siRNA, proteins, Ayurvedic drugs and enzymes. 4 DFNS was also used for photothermal based ablation therapy as well as in the simultaneous delivery of chemo and radiotherapeutics. DFNS has also been used to design anti-reflective, superhydrophobic coating, florescent bioprobe as well as anti-reflective and antibacterial nanocoating. 3,4 We hypothesized that due to nano-size particles, high surface area, unique fibrous morphology and wide pore size distribution, DFNS would be able to extract and isolate the RNA even from dilute samples, and hence will be able to produce high purity RNA with better yield. Although the use of silica column technique is well-known for RNA extraction, 8-25 use of fibrous nano-silica and effect of silica morphology on RNA extraction has not been studied before.</p><p>DFNS with three different sizes 50, 100, and 500 nm were synthesized using our reported protocol. 3 The solid silica sphere (Stober's silica) was also prepared for comparison. Particle size and morphology were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 1), while textural properties (surface area, pore size distribution and pore volume) were analyzed by N 2 sorption technique. DFNS-500, DFNS-100 and DFN-50 showed average particle sizes of ~ 500, 100 and 50 nm, and surface area (SA)/pore volume (PV) of 580/0.7, 535/0.9, 787/1.6 m 2 g -1 /cm 3 g -1 respectively, which are known to have enhanced accessibility as compared to conventional porous silicas. 2,3 Stöber silica showed average particle sizes of ~ 400 nm, and exhibits lower surface area (SA)/pore volume (PV) of 77/0.08 m 2 g -1 /cm 3 g -1 due to the absence of porosity. By comparing DFNS with Stöber's silica, we studied the role of morphology and pore structure of DFNS on the RNA extraction efficiency.</p><p>Figure 1. TEM images (a1, b1, c1, d1,a2,b2,c2,d2), N 2 adsorption-desoprtion isotherms (a3, b3, c3, d3) and pore size distribution (a4, b4, c4, d4) for DFNS-500, 100, 50 and Stöber's silica spheres. SA-Surface Area, PV-Pore Volume These materials were then evaluated for RNA extraction (Figure 2) by following the optimized extraction protocol shown in Scheme 1. In a typical procedure, cell pellet was first homogenized in trizol buffer (500 µL of trizol for ~3 X 10 6 cell counts) and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature (RT). To this solution, chloroform (100 µL per 500 µL of trizol) was added. After mixing, the resultant mixture was centrifuged (12 K rpm for 20 min at 4 o C) and the aqueous phase was separated into a new tube. An equal volume of 70% ethanol was added to this mixture and was then transferred to another tube containing nanosilica (~ 0.5 mg of DFNS-500, 100, 50 or Stöber's silica) powder. This was further mixed on vortex for 2 minutes and incubated for another 2 min at RT, followed by centrifugation at 12 K rpm for 1 min at RT. After decanting the clear liquid from 1 st wash buffer (3M Sodium Acetate, 10 mM Tris [pH 7]) was added, vortexed, and centrifuged. After decanting the 1 st wash buffer, 2 nd wash buffer [80% Ethanol in Diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated water and 10 mM Tris (pH 7)] was added, vortexed and centrifuged. The wash step using 2 nd wash buffer was repeated thrice. After decanting 2 nd wash buffer, RNA loaded DFNS solid was dried at 45 0 C for 30 min to remove ethanol and then RNA was extracted using DEPC treated water as eluent.</p>If the ratio is appreciably lower than expected, it may indicate the presence of contaminants which absorb at 230 nm]<p>Among various silica materials studied, DFNS-500 showed the highest RNA extraction ability (Fig. 2a). DFNS-500 extracted 4 µg of RNA per mg silica from ~ 0.2 × 10 6 HEK293T cells. Although DFNS-500, 100, 50 are very similar in terms of morphology and surface area, DFNS-500 turns out to be better for RNA extraction. One of the reasons behind this difference is the agglomeration of the small-sized DFNS (50,100) particles restricting the interactions of RNA with silica pores and surface (as seen from TEM, Fig. 1 c1, c2). On the other hand, DFNS-500 particles do not aggregate, which leads to better accessibility of the internal pore structure and surface of silica. To understand the effect of fibrous morphology of DFNS on RNA extraction efficiency, it was compared with commercial silica gels (silica gels of 60-120 mesh and 100-200 mesh with ~ 400 m 2 /g SA) and Stöber's solid silica spheres. DFNS-500 RNA extraction efficiency was found to be more than double as compared to silica gels (Figure 2a) and was also eight times more efficient than similar-sized Stöber silica solid spheres (Figure 2a). This indicates the role of the fibrous morphology of DFNS, as well as its high and accessible surface to bind with RNA. The better RNA extraction efficiency of DFNS over other silica materials can also be due to its unique broad pore size distribution from 4.5 to 25 nm, (Figure 1a1, a4), allowing efficient diffusion of big RNA molecules. To optimize the amount of the DFNS-500 required, RNA extraction was carried out using a varied amount of DFNS (0.5 to 12 mg). Notably, 0.5 mg DFNS is sufficient to extract RNA with good purity (Figure 2b, 2a inset). We also studied the RNA extraction capacity of DFNS-500 from samples with varying cells counts and observed that DFNS-500 could isolate RNA from as low as ~100000 cells (Figure 2a inset). This indicates the applicability of this extraction protocol for samples with varying concentrations of cells. The gel electrophoresis study confirmed the RNA integrity (Figure 2a, inset). These findings indicate the potential use of DFNS for RNA extraction from viral samples. Extracted RNA was used to carry out cDNA synthesis followed by both PCR and qPCR successfully (Fig. S1), indicating the feasibility of this RNA extraction protocol for actual applications of RNA extraction from cells. DFNS-500 showed significantly better RNA extraction ability as compared to the best known commercial RNA extraction QIAGEN RNeasy column kit (Table S1). Note that QIAGEN optimized buffers are different than ours. Their buffer's details are protected and not available in the literature, while ours is simple to prepare buffers. No information about the silica that QIAGEN used is available in the literature, while DFNS is well documented and easy to prepare even at large scale. 3,4 To understand the chemistry of interactions of RNA binding with DFNS surface, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed. FTIR of RNA, 26 DFNS and DFNS bonded RNA (DFNS-RNA) were recorded (Figure 3). In pure RNA, the peak at 1399 cm -1 was assigned to the C-N stretching as well as N-H and C-H deformations of the nucleotides in RNA. 26 In DFNS-RNA, this peak was shifted from 1399 to 1416 cm -1 . This ~17 cm -1 shift was due to the hydrogen-bonding interactions of N-H of RNA nucleotides with surface silanol groups (Si-OH) of DFNS. Due to higher surface area and fibrous morphology, DFNS exhibits a higher number of Si-OH (silanol) groups when compared to Stöber silica, causing more RNA-DFNS interactions via interactions of N-H of RNA nucleotides with silica silanols. This finding was further confirmed by carrying out RNA extraction using DFNS with less number of silanols by treating DFNS with ammonia. RNA extraction efficiency of base treated DFNS-B reduced by more than 30% compared to pure DFNS (DFNS-B, Figure 2a). This was due to less number of Si-OH on the DFNS surface, reducing RNA nucleotide interactions with silanols as observed in the FTIR study (Figure 3). In conclusion, this study shows that DFNS can be a potential material for RNA extraction from cells and viral samples. Notably, DFNS showed eight times higher RNA extraction efficiency as compared to Stöber silica and also higher extraction ability when compared to commercial porous silica materials. This could be due to the higher surface area and fibrous morphology of DFNS, whose large number of silanols caused efficient RNA-DFNS interactions via N-H of RNA nucleotides with silica silanols. RNA extraction capacity of DFNS-500 with various amounts of samples with varying cell counts indicated that DFNS-500 could isolate RNA (~0.7 µg) from low cell numbers (as low as ~100000 cells), indicating the applicability of this extraction protocol for samples with the low amount of cells. The ratio of absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm and gel electrophoresis study confirmed the RNA purity and integrity, respectively. The extraction protocol that we have developed uses readily available buffers and washing solutions. Overall, this work may provide an alternative RNA extraction protocol, which can be carried out in any basic laboratory without any complicated process and instrumentation and could be the savior for countries that are importing RNA extraction kits in current Covid-19 pandemic situation or for future.</p>ASSOCIATED CONTENT<p>Supporting Information.

Despite the availability of several commercial kits, there is an enormous scope to develop novel materials that have high binding and elution capacities. Here we show that RNA from the cells can be extracted by dendritic fibrous nanosilica (DFNS) with higher efficiency than commercially available silica. This could be because of the unique fibrous morphology, high accessible surface area, and nano-size particles of DFNS. We studied various fundamental aspects, including the role of particle size, morphology, surface area, and charge on silica surface on RNA extraction efficiency. Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) studies revealed the interaction of functional groups of the RNA with the silica surface, causing selective binding. Due to the sustainable synthesis protocol of DFNS, the simplicity of various buffers and washing solutions used, this RNA extraction kits can be assembled in any lab. In addition to the fundamental aspects of DFNS-RNA interactions, this study has the potential to initiate the development of indigenous DFNS based kits for RNA extraction."},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Hydroxychloroquine (CLQ-OH)/azithromycin (ATM) combination therapy is currently being tested for the treatment of COVID-19, with promising results. However, the molecular mechanism of action of this combination is not yet established. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, this study shows that the drugs act in synergy to prevent any close contact between the virus and the plasma membrane of host cells. Unexpected molecular similarity is shown between ATM and the sugar moiety of GM1, a lipid raft ganglioside acting as a host attachment cofactor for respiratory viruses. Due to this mimicry, ATM interacts with the ganglioside-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This binding site shared by ATM and GM1 displays a conserved amino acid triad Q-134/F-135/N-137 located at the tip of the spike protein. CLQ-OH molecules are shown to saturate virus attachment sites on gangliosides in the vicinity of the primary coronavirus receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2). Taken together, these data show that ATM is directed against the virus, whereas CLQ-OH is directed against cellular attachment cofactors. We conclude that both drugs act as competitive inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the host-cell membrane. This is consistent with a synergistic antiviral mechanism at the plasma membrane level, where therapeutic intervention is likely to be most efficient. This molecular mechanism may explain the beneficial effects of CLQ-OH/ATM combination therapy in patients with COVID-19. Incidentally, the data also indicate that the conserved Q-134/F-135/N-137 triad could be considered as a target for vaccine strategies.","answer":"[\\"Treatment\\", \\"Mechanism\\"]"},{"question":"You will be shown a claim about public health, and the abstract of a biomedical research paper.

Yet, other medications, including lithium, divalproex sodium, topiramate, methysergide, gabapentin, and even indomethacin, may be useful when the headache fails to respond to verapamil.For medically refractory patients, surgical interventions, occipital nerve stimulation, and deep brain stimulation remain an option.The objective of this open single-centre study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of botulinum toxin type-A (BTX-A) as add-on in the prophylactic treatment of cluster headache (CH).These findings provide evidence that BTX-A may be beneficial as an add-on prophylactic therapy for a limited number of patients with chronic CH.There are a variety of different medications for abortive and prophylactic therapy, accompanied by a variable amount of evidence-based medicine.Most procedures are directed against the sensory trigeminal nerve and associated ganglia, eg, anesthetizing the sphenopalatine ganglion.The mainstay of prophylactic therapy is verapamil. Lithium, divalproex sodium, or topiramate may also be useful.Based on our clinical experience, we recommended the combination of nasal sumatriptan for acute attacks and verapamil 240 mg/day for prophylaxis.Topiramate also appears to be well tolerated and useful in the adjunctive treatment of cluster headache.The cornerstone of maintenance prophylaxis is verapamil, yet methysergide, lithium, and divalproex sodium may also be employed. In some patients, melatonin or topiramate may be useful adjunctive therapies.Prophylactic therapy in most cases consisted of verapamil, also with a good response.Patients with chronic cluster headache may achieve good results from long-term treatment with other therapies, including lithium carbonate, verapamil, and ketoprofen.","answer":"Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, is considered the mainstay of prophylactic therapy of Cluster Headache patients.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to efforts at rapid investigation and application of drugs which may improve prognosis but for which safety and efficacy are not yet established. This document attempts to provide reasonable guidance for the use of antimicrobials which have uncertain benefit but may increase risk of QT interval prolongation and ventricular proarrhythmia , notably , chloroquine , hydroxychloroquine , azithromycin , and lopinavir/ritonavir . During the pandemic, efforts to reduce spread and minimize effects on health care resources mandate minimization of unnecessary medical procedures and testing. We recommend that the risk of drug proarrhythmia be minimized by 1) discontinuing unnecessary medications that may also increase the QT interval, 2) identifying outpatients who are likely to be at low risk and do not need further testing (no history of prolonged QT interval, unexplained syncope, or family history of premature sudden cardiac death, no medications that may prolong the QT interval, and/or a previous known normal corrected QT interval [QTc]), and 3) performing baseline testing in hospitalized patients or those who may be at higher risk. If baseline electrocardiographic testing reveals a moderately prolonged QTc, optimization of medications and electrolytes may permit therapy. If the QTc is markedly prolonged, drugs that further prolong it should be avoided, or expert consultation may permit administration with mitigating precautions. These recommendations are made while there are no known effective treatments for COVID-19 and should be revisited when further data on efficacy and safety become available.sentence: This document attempts to provide reasonable guidance for the use of antimicrobials which have uncertain benefit but may increase risk of QT interval prolongation and ventricular proarrhythmia , notably , chloroquine , hydroxychloroquine , azithromycin , and lopinavir/ritonavir .","answer":"[]"},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

We introduce Dense Neural Patterns, short for DNPs, which are dense local features derived from discriminatively trained deep convolutional neural networks. DNPs can be easily plugged into conventional detection frameworks in the same way as other dense local features(like HOG or LBP). The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated with the Regionlets object detection framework. It achieved 46.1 mean average precision on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset, and 44.1 on the PASCAL VOC 2010 dataset, which dramatically improves the original Regionlets approach without DNPs.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: We present a new machine learning framework called \\"self-taught learning\\" for using unlabeled data in supervised classification tasks. We do not assume that the unlabeled data follows the same class labels or generative distribution as the labeled data. Thus, we would like to use a large number of unlabeled images (or audio samples, or text documents) randomly downloaded from the Internet to improve performance on a given image (or audio, or text) classification task. Such unlabeled data is significantly easier to obtain than in typical semi-supervised or transfer learning settings, making self-taught learning widely applicable to many practical learning problems. We describe an approach to self-taught learning that uses sparse coding to construct higher-level features using the unlabeled data. These features form a succinct input representation and significantly improve classification performance. When using an SVM for classification, we further show how a Fisher kernel can be learned for this representation.[2]: A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research.","answer":"The proposed approach is a new example of transfer learning, transferring the knowledge learned from large-scale image classification (in this case, ImageNet image classification) to generic object detection. There have been some very interesting approaches in transferring the learned knowledge by deep neural networks. For example, [1] and [2] illustrated transfer learning with unlabeled data or labels from other tasks. Our work shares a similar spirit but in a different context. It transfers the knowledge learned from a classification task to object detection by trickling high-level information in top convolutional layers in a deep CNN down to low-level image patches."},{"question":"You are provided with the abstract of a scientific paper and the abstracts of the papers it references.

Two dimensional point or blob vortex models have the advantage of having a Hamiltonian, whereas 3D vortex filament or tube systems do not necessarily have one, although they do have action functionals. On the other hand, certain classes of 3D vortex models called nearly parallel vortex filament models do have a Hamiltonian and are more accurate descriptions of geophysical and atmospheric flows than purely 2D models, especially at smaller scales. In these quasi-2D'' models we replace 2D point vortices with vortex filaments that are very straight and nearly parallel but have Brownian variations along their lengths due to local self-induction. When very straight, quasi-2D filaments are expected to have virtually the same planar density distributions as 2D models. An open problem is when quasi-2D model statistics behave differently than those of the related 2D system and how this difference is manifested. In this paper we study the nearly parallel vortex filament model of Klein, Majda, Damodaran in statistical equilibrium. We are able to obtain a free-energy functional for the system in a non-extensive thermodynamic limit that is a function of the mean square vortex position @math and solve for @math . Such an explicit formula has never been obtained for a non-2D model. We compare the results of our formula to a 2-D formula of Lim:2005 and show qualitatively different behavior even when we disallow vortex braiding. We further confirm our results using Path Integral Monte Carlo (Ceperley (1995)) permutations and that the Klein, Majda, Damodaran model's asymptotic assumptions for parameters where these deviations occur.Cited Abstract(s):[1]: Almost all studies of vortex states in helium II have been concerned with either ordered vortex arrays or disordered vortex tangles. This work numerically studies what happens in the presence of both rotation (which induces order) and thermal counterflow (which induces disorder). We find a new statistically steady state in which the vortex tangle is polarized along the rotational axis. Our results are used to interpret an instability that was discovered experimentally by [Phys. Rev. Lett. 50, 190 (1983)] and the vortex state beyond the instability that has been unexplained until now.","answer":"[1] has done some excellent simulations of vortex tangles in He-4 with rotation, boundary walls, and vortex reconnections to study disorder in rotating superfluid turbulence. Because vortex tangles are extremely curved, they applied the full Biot-Savart law to calculate the motion of the filaments in time. Their study did not include any sort of comparison to 2-D models because for most of the simulation vortices were far too tangled. The inclusion of rigid boundary walls, although correct for the study of He-4, also makes the results only tangentially applicable to the KMD system we use."},{"question":"You will be presented with a citation segment from the section of a research paper.

RATIONALE The response characteristics of the 6 minute walk test ( 6MWT ) in studies of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) are only poorly understood , and the change in walk distance that constitutes the minimum important difference ( MID ) over time is unknown . OBJECTIVES To examine changes over time in distance walked ( ie , 6MWD ) during the 6MWT and to estimate the change in distance that constitutes the MID in patients with IPF . METHODS Data from a recently completed trial that included subjects with IPF who completed the 6MWT , Saint George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) and forced vital capacity ( FVC ) at 6 and 12 months were used to examine longitudinal changes in 6MWD . Both anchor- and distribution-based approaches as well as linear regression analyses were used to determine the MID for 6MWD . The SGRQ Total score and FVC were used as clinical anchors . MAIN RESULTS Among 123 subjects alive and able to complete the 6MWT at both follow-up time points , 6MWD did not change significantly over time ( 378.1 m at baseline vs 376.8 m at 6 months vs 361.3 m at 12 months , p=0.5 ) . The point estimate for the 6MWD MID was 28 m with a range of 10.8-58.5 m. CONCLUSION In a group of patients with IPF with moderate physiological impairment , for those alive and able to complete a 6MWT , 6MWD does not change over 12 months . At the population level , the MID for 6MWD appears to be approximately 28 m. Further investigation using other anchors and derivation methods is required to refine estimates of the MID for 6MWD in this patient population .","answer":"{\\"Intervention\\": [\\"6 minute walk test ( 6MWT )\\", \\"6MWT\\"], \\"Outcome\\": [\\"SGRQ Total score and FVC\\", \\"6MWD\\", \\"time in distance walked\\"], \\"Participant\\": []}"},{"question":"You will be shown a paragraph from a biomedical research paper, followed by a question about the paper.

Moreover, not all viral infections of the airway will lead to acute exacerbations, suggesting a more complex interplay between the virus and upper airway epithelium which synergize with the local airway environment in line with the \\"united airway\\" hypothesis (Kurai et al., 2013) . On the other hand, viral infections or their components persist in patients with chronic airway inflammatory disease (Kling et al., 2005; Wood et al., 2011; Ravi et al., 2019) . Hence, their presence may further alter the local environment and contribute to current and future exacerbations. Future studies should be performed using metagenomics in addition to PCR analysis to determine the contribution of the microbiome and mycobiome to viral infections. In this review, we highlight recent data regarding viral interactions with the airway epithelium that could also contribute to, or further aggravate, acute exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Patients with chronic airway inflammatory diseases have impaired or reduced ability of viral clearance (Hammond et al., 2015; McKendry et al., 2016; Akbarshahi et al., 2018; Gill et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Singanayagam et al., 2019b) . Their impairment stems from a type 2-skewed inflammatory response which deprives the airway of important type 1 responsive CD8 cells that are responsible for the complete clearance of virusinfected cells (Becker, 2006; McKendry et al., 2016) . This is especially evident in weak type 1 inflammation-inducing viruses such as RV and RSV (Kling et al., 2005; Wood et al., 2011; Ravi et al., 2019) . Additionally, there are also evidence of reduced type I (IFNβ) and III (IFNλ) interferon production due to type 2-skewed inflammation, which contributes to imperfect clearance of the virus resulting in persistence of viral components, or the live virus in the airway epithelium (Contoli et al., 2006; Hwang et al., 2019; Wark, 2019) . Due to the viral components remaining in the airway, antiviral genes such as type I interferons, inflammasome activating factors and cytokines remained activated resulting in prolong airway inflammation (Wood et al., 2011; Essaidi-Laziosi et al., 2018) . These factors enhance granulocyte infiltration thus prolonging the exacerbation symptoms. Such persistent inflammation may also be found within DNA viruses such as AdV, hCMV and HSV, whose infections generally persist longer (Imperiale and Jiang, 2015) , further contributing to chronic activation of inflammation when they infect the airway (Yang et al., 2008; Morimoto et al., 2009; Imperiale and Jiang, 2015; Lan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2016; Kowalski et al., 2017) . With that note, human papilloma virus (HPV), a DNA virus highly associated with head and neck cancers and respiratory papillomatosis, is also linked with the chronic inflammation that precedes the malignancies (de Visser et al., 2005; Gillison et al., 2012; Bonomi et al., 2014; Fernandes et al., 2015) . Therefore, the role of HPV infection in causing chronic inflammation in the airway and their association to exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases, which is scarcely explored, should be investigated in the future. Furthermore, viral persistence which lead to continuous expression of antiviral genes may also lead to the development of steroid resistance, which is seen with RV, RSV, and PIV infection (Chi et al., 2011; Ford et al., 2013; Papi et al., 2013) . The use of steroid to suppress the inflammation may also cause the virus to linger longer in the airway due to the lack of antiviral clearance (Kim et al., 2008; Hammond et al., 2015; Hewitt et al., 2016; McKendry et al., 2016; Singanayagam et al., 2019b) . The concomitant development of steroid resistance together with recurring or prolong viral infection thus added considerable burden to the management of acute exacerbation, which should be the future focus of research to resolve the dual complications arising from viral infection. On the other end of the spectrum, viruses that induce strong type 1 inflammation and cell death such as IFV (Yan et al., 2016; Guibas et al., 2018) and certain CoV (including the recently emerged COVID-19 virus) (Tao et al., 2013; Yue et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2020) , may not cause prolonged inflammation due to strong induction of antiviral clearance. These infections, however, cause massive damage and cell death to the epithelial barrier, so much so that areas of the epithelium may be completely absent post infection (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2019) . Factors such as RANTES and CXCL10, which recruit immune cells to induce apoptosis, are strongly induced from IFV infected epithelium (Ampomah et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2019) . Additionally, necroptotic factors such as RIP3 further compounds the cell deaths in IFV infected epithelium . The massive cell death induced may result in worsening of the acute exacerbation due to the release of their cellular content into the airway, further evoking an inflammatory response in the airway (Guibas et al., 2018) . Moreover, the destruction of the epithelial barrier may cause further contact with other pathogens and allergens in the airway which may then prolong exacerbations or results in new exacerbations. Epithelial destruction may also promote further epithelial remodeling during its regeneration as viral infection induces the expression of remodeling genes such as MMPs and growth factors . Infections that cause massive destruction of the epithelium, such as IFV, usually result in severe acute exacerbations with non-classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Fortunately, annual vaccines are available to prevent IFV infections (Vasileiou et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2018) ; and it is recommended that patients with chronic airway inflammatory disease receive their annual influenza vaccination as the best means to prevent severe IFV induced exacerbation. Another mechanism that viral infections may use to drive acute exacerbations is the induction of vasodilation or tight junction opening factors which may increase the rate of infiltration. Infection with a multitude of respiratory viruses causes disruption of tight junctions with the resulting increased rate of viral infiltration. This also increases the chances of allergens coming into contact with airway immune cells. For example, IFV infection was found to induce oncostatin M (OSM) which causes tight junction opening (Pothoven et al., 2015; Tian et al., 2018) . Similarly, RV and RSV infections usually cause tight junction opening which may also increase the infiltration rate of eosinophils and thus worsening of the classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases (Sajjan et al., 2008; Kast et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2018) . In addition, the expression of vasodilating factors and fluid homeostatic factors such as angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) and bactericidal/permeabilityincreasing fold-containing family member A1 (BPIFA1) are also associated with viral infections and pneumonia development, which may worsen inflammation in the lower airway Akram et al., 2018) . These factors may serve as targets to prevent viral-induced exacerbations during the management of acute exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Another recent area of interest is the relationship between asthma and COPD exacerbations and their association with the airway microbiome. The development of chronic airway inflammatory diseases is usually linked to specific bacterial species in the microbiome which may thrive in the inflamed airway environment (Diver et al., 2019) . In the event of a viral infection such as RV infection, the effect induced by the virus may destabilize the equilibrium of the microbiome present (Molyneaux et al., 2013; Kloepfer et al., 2014; Kloepfer et al., 2017; Jubinville et al., 2018; van Rijn et al., 2019) . In addition, viral infection may disrupt biofilm colonies in the upper airway (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae) microbiome to be release into the lower airway and worsening the inflammation (Marks et al., 2013; Chao et al., 2014) . Moreover, a viral infection may also alter the nutrient profile in the airway through release of previously inaccessible nutrients that will alter bacterial growth (Siegel et al., 2014; Mallia et al., 2018) . Furthermore, the destabilization is further compounded by impaired bacterial immune response, either from direct viral influences, or use of corticosteroids to suppress the exacerbation symptoms  (Singanayagam et al., 2018 (Singanayagam et al., , 2019a Wang et al., 2018; Finney et al., 2019) . All these may gradually lead to more far reaching effect when normal flora is replaced with opportunistic pathogens, altering the inflammatory profiles (Teo et al., 2018) . These changes may in turn result in more severe and frequent acute exacerbations due to the interplay between virus and pathogenic bacteria in exacerbating chronic airway inflammatory diseases (Wark et al., 2013; Singanayagam et al., 2018) . To counteract these effects, microbiome-based therapies are in their infancy but have shown efficacy in the treatments of irritable bowel syndrome by restoring the intestinal microbiome (Bakken et al., 2011) . Further research can be done similarly for the airway microbiome to be able to restore the microbiome following disruption by a viral infection. Viral infections can cause the disruption of mucociliary function, an important component of the epithelial barrier.

Therefore, its infection by respiratory viruses may have far reaching consequences in augmenting and synergizing current and future acute exacerbations. The destruction of epithelial barrier, mucociliary function and cell death of the epithelial cells serves to increase contact between environmental triggers with the lower airway and resident immune cells. The opening of tight junction increasing the leakiness further augments the inflammation and exacerbations. In addition, viral infections are usually accompanied with oxidative stress which will further increase the local inflammation in the airway. The dysregulation of inflammation can be further compounded by modulation of miRNAs and epigenetic modification such as DNA methylation and histone modifications that promote dysregulation in inflammation. Finally, the change in the local airway environment and inflammation promotes growth of pathogenic bacteria that may replace the airway microbiome. Furthermore, the inflammatory environment may also disperse upper airway commensals into the lower airway, further causing inflammation and alteration of the lower airway environment, resulting in prolong exacerbation episodes following viral infection. Viral specific trait contributing to exacerbation mechanism (with literature evidence) Oxidative stress ROS production (RV, RSV, IFV, HSV)As RV, RSV, and IFV were the most frequently studied viruses in chronic airway inflammatory diseases, most of the viruses listed are predominantly these viruses. However, the mechanisms stated here may also be applicable to other viruses but may not be listed as they were not implicated in the context of chronic airway inflammatory diseases exacerbation (see text for abbreviations). that aid in the proper function of the motile cilia in the airways are aberrantly expressed in ciliated airway epithelial cells which are the major target for RV infection (Griggs et al., 2017) . Such form of secondary cilia dyskinesia appears to be present with chronic inflammations in the airway, but the exact mechanisms are still unknown (Peng et al., , 2019 Qiu et al., 2018) . Nevertheless, it was found that in viral infection such as IFV, there can be a change in the metabolism of the cells as well as alteration in the ciliary gene expression, mostly in the form of down-regulation of the genes such as dynein axonemal heavy chain 5 (DNAH5) and multiciliate differentiation And DNA synthesis associated cell cycle protein (MCIDAS) (Tan et al., 2018b . The recently emerged Wuhan CoV was also found to reduce ciliary beating in infected airway epithelial cell model (Zhu et al., 2020) . Furthermore, viral infections such as RSV was shown to directly destroy the cilia of the ciliated cells and almost all respiratory viruses infect the ciliated cells (Jumat et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018a) . In addition, mucus overproduction may also disrupt the equilibrium of the mucociliary function following viral infection, resulting in symptoms of acute exacerbation (Zhu et al., 2009) . Hence, the disruption of the ciliary movement during viral infection may cause more foreign material and allergen to enter the airway, aggravating the symptoms of acute exacerbation and making it more difficult to manage. The mechanism of the occurrence of secondary cilia dyskinesia can also therefore be explored as a means to limit the effects of viral induced acute exacerbation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional modulation of biological processes, and implicated in a number of diseases (Tan et al., 2014) .Question: What is  the destabilization is further compounded by?","answer":"impaired bacterial immune response, either from direct viral influences, or use of corticosteroids to suppress the exacerbation symptoms"},{"question":"You have to answer a biomedical question in binary format, i.e. only yes and no are the only acceptable answer formats. A list of paragraphs is provided as context to help you answer the question.Question: Does the CTCF protein co-localize with cohesin?Context: To investigate cohesin-non-CTCF (CNC) binding events in vivo we mapped cohesin and CTCF, as well as a collection of tissue-specific and ubiquitous transcriptional regulators using ChIP-seq in primary mouse liver.In contrast to regions of the genome where cohesin and CTCF colocalize, CNC sites coincide with the binding of master regulators and enhancer-markers and are significantly associated with liver-specific expressed genes.Here we report that cohesins colocalize with CTCF at two additional imprinted loci, the Dlk1-Dio3 and the Kcnq1/Kcnq1ot1 loci.By use of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), we found that liver-specific transcription factors colocalize with cohesin independently of CTCF at liver-specific targets that are distinct from those found in breast cancer cellsBecause cohesin can colocalize with CTCF, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation for the cohesin subunit Rad21 and found lineage and stage-specific Rad21 recruitment to CTCF in all Ig lociHere we show that zebrafish runx1 is directly bound by cohesin and CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) at the P1 and P2 promoters, and within the intron between P1 and P2.The intronic binding sites for cohesin and CTCF coincide with histone modifications that confer enhancer-like properties, and two of the cohesin/CTCF sites behaved as insulators in an in vivo assayThe identified cohesin and CTCF binding sites are likely to be cis-regulatory elements (CREs) for runx1 since they also recruit RNA polymerase II (RNAPII).We have found that CTCF and cohesin are highly enriched at the convergent and partially overlapping transcripts for the LMP1 and LMP2A genes, but it is not yet known how CTCF and cohesin may coordinately regulate these transcriptsharacterization of constitutive CTCF/cohesin loci: a possible role in establishing topological domains in mammalian genomesOur analysis revealed: 1) constitutive CTCF loci were located in constitutive open chromatin and often co-localized with constitutive cohesin lociIn brain, a third of CTCF and cohesin binding sites coincide, consistent with the potential for many interactions between cohesin and CTCF but also many instances of independent actionHere, we focus on the emerging roles of CTCF and the cohesin in coordinating long-range interactions between regulatory elementsChromatin immunoprecipitation for CTCF and the cohesin subunits RAD21 and SMC3 reveals evolutionarily conserved binding sites within unmethylated regions ∼5 kb downstream of the PLAGL1 differentially methylated region and within the PLAGL1 3' untranslated region (UTR)TCF physically links cohesin to chromatinohesin and CTCF: cooperating to control chromosome conformation?Recently, three groups mapped numerous cohesin-binding sites in mammalian chromosomes and found substantial overlap with the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)We found that each site contains a conserved CTCF consensus sequence, binds CTCF, and recruits the cohesin subunit Rad21 in vivoRecent experiments have revealed that cohesin binds to the same sites in mammalian genomes as the zinc finger transcription factor CTCFHere we review what is known about the roles of cohesin and CTCF in regulating gene expression in mammalian cells, and we discuss how cohesin might mediate the insulator function of CTCFPrevious studies have shown that this major latency control region is occupied by the cellular chromatin boundary factor CTCF and chromosome structural maintenance proteins SMC1, SMC3, and RAD21, which comprise the cohesin complexCohesin subunits assembled at the CTCF binding sites and bound CTCF proteins in a cell cycle-dependent mannerWe propose that the CTCF-cohesin complex plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle control of viral gene expression during latency and that failure to maintain cell cycle control of latent transcripts inhibits host cell proliferation and survivalWe used chromosome conformation capture to determine long-range interactions among CTCF/cohesin sites over 2 Mb on human chromosome 11 encompassing the beta-globin locus and flanking olfactory receptor genesThese results support a genome-wide role for CTCF/cohesin sites through loop formation that both influences transcription and contributes to cell-type-specific chromatin organization and functionIncreased methylation at this promoter triggered the dissociation of the insulator protein CTCF as well as the accompanying cohesin from the BDNF locusicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-regulated DNA methylation alters CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)/cohesin binding and transcription at the BDNF locusecent studies have shown that the protein CTCF, which plays an important role in insulation and in large-scale organization of chromatin within the eukaryotic nucleus, depends for both activities on recruitment of the cohesin complexWe show here that the interaction of CTCF with the cohesin complex involves direct contacts between the cohesin subunit SA2 and specific regions of the C-terminal tail of CTCFTaken together, our results demonstrate that specific sites on the C terminus of CTCF are essential for cohesin binding and insulator functionThe only direct interaction between CTCF and cohesin involves contact with SA2, which is external to the cohesin ringThese numerous CTCF/cohesin sites potentially form the bases of the multiloop rosette structures at the Igh locus that compact during Ig heavy chain rearrangementWe have previously shown that the Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) major latency transcripts encoding LANA, vCyclin, vFLIP, v-miRNAs, and Kaposin are regulated, in part, by a chromatin organizing element that binds CTCF and cohesinsMutation of the CTCF-cohesin binding site reduced or eliminated the chromatin conformation linkages, and deregulated viral transcription and genome copy number controlOur findings indicate that KSHV genomes are organized into chromatin loops mediated by CTCF and cohesin interactions, and that these inter-chromosomal linkages coordinate latent and lytic gene control.We show here that GA disrupts an RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complex that accumulates at the CTCF-cohesin binding site within the first intron of the latency transcript.GA altered the enrichment of the RNAPII pausing complex, along with pausing factors SPT5 and NELF-A, at the intragenic CTCF-cohesin binding sites.GA treatment also inhibited the transcription of some cellular genes, like c-myc, which contain a similar CTCF-cohesin binding site within the first intron.These findings suggest that RNAPII pauses at intragenic CTCF-cohesin binding sites and that abrogation of this pausing by GA leads to loss of proper mRNA production and defects in sister chromatid cohesion, a process important for both viral and cellular chromosome stability.TCF and cohesin cooperatively mediate the cell-type specific interchromatin interaction between Bcl11b and Arhgap6 lociAdditional experiments verified that the interchromatin interaction between the Bcl11b and Arhgap6 loci was cell-type specific, which was cooperatively mediated by CTCF and cohesin.enome-wide studies of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin provide insight into chromatin structure and regulationRecent genome-wide studies mapping the binding sites of CTCF and its interacting partner, cohesin, using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealded that CTCF globally co-localizes with cohesinHere, we show by ChIP-Seq that most human subtelomeres contain a CTCF- and cohesin-binding site within ∼1-2 kb of the TTAGGG repeat tract and adjacent to a CpG-islands implicated in TERRA transcription control.These findings indicate that CTCF and cohesin are integral components of most human subtelomeres, and important for the regulation of TERRA transcription and telomere end protectionIn addition, we show that this DNA looping requires specific binding of the CTCF/cohesin complex to two symmetrically aligned binding sites in both the transcriptionally active promoters and in one of the enhancers","answer":"yes"},{"question":"You will be shown a question, followed by excerpts from biomedical research papers. Please answer the question based on the provided context.

At a number of loci in Drosophila, this pairing can significantly influence gene expression. Such influences were first detected within the bithorax complex (BX-C) by E.B. Lewis, who coined the term transvection to describe them. Most cases of transvection involve the action of enhancers in trans. At several loci deletion of the promoter greatly increases this action in trans, suggesting that enhancers are normally tethered in cis by the promoter region. Transvection can also occur by the action of silencers in trans or by the spreading of position effect variegation from rearrangements having heterochromatic breakpoints to paired unrearranged chromosomes. Although not demonstrated, other cases of transvection may involve the production of joint RNAs by trans-splicing. Several cases of transvection require Zeste, a DNA-binding protein that is thought to facilitate homolog interactions by self-aggregation. Genes showing transvection can differ greatly in their response to pairing disruption. In several cases, transvection appears to require intimate synapsis of homologs. However, in at least one case (transvection of the iab-5,6,7 region of the BX-C), transvection is independent of synapsis within and surrounding the interacting gene. The latter example suggests that transvection could well occur in organisms that lack somatic pairing. In support of this, transvection-like phenomena have been described in a number of different organisms, including plants, fungi, and mammalsPairing-dependent interallelic complementation was first described for the Ultrabithorax gene of the bithorax-complex in Drosophila by Lewis and cited as an example of a new phenomenon that Lewis called the \\"trans-vection effect.\\" Several different kinds of pairing-dependent gene expression have been observed in Drosophila, and it is now clear that a variety of different molecular mechanisms probably underlie the changes in gene expression that are observed after disrupting chromosome pairing. Transvection in the bithorax-complex appears to result from the ability of cis-regulatory elements to regulate transcription of the promoter on the homologous chromosome. The same phenomenon appears to be responsible for pairing-dependent interallelic complementation at numerous other genes in Drosophila. Some transvection effects are dependent on the presence of wild-type or specific mutant forms of the protein encoded by the zeste trans-regulatory gene, but other transvection effects are zeste-independent. The ease with which chromosome aberrations can disrupt transvection also varies widely among different genesThe presence of homologous nucleic acid sequences can exert profound effects on chromosomal and gene function in a wide range of organisms. These homology effects reveal remarkable forms of regulation as well as suggest possible avenues for the development of new technologiesEnhancers have been defined operationally as cis-regulatory sequences that can stimulate transcription of RNA polymerase-II-transcribed genes over large distances and even when located downstream of the gene. Recently, it has become evident that enhancers can also stimulate transcription in trans if they are brought into close proximity to the promoter/gene. These reports provide clues to the mechanism of remote enhancer action. In addition, the findings, together with genetic studies in Drosophila, strongly suggest that enhancer action in trans could underlie phenomena such as 'transvection', where one chromosome affects gene expression in the paired homologNumerous genes contain regulatory elements located many tens of kilobases away from the promoter they control. Specific mechanisms must be required to ensure that such distant elements can find and interact with their proper targets but not with extraneous genes. This review explores the connections between transvection phenomena, the activation of domains of homeotic gene expression, position effect variegation and silencers. These various examples of long-distance effects suggest that, in all cases, related forms of chromatin packaging may be involvedThe zeste locus of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a DNA-binding protein that can influence transcription. A number of sites recognized by this protein fall within genes associated with transvection, a phenomenon suggesting a form of gene regulation that is responsive to the proximity of a gene to its homologous allele on another chromosomeSpecial attention is paid to the transvection effect (synapsis-dependent interaction between white and zeste genes), cis-acting regulatory elements and the behaviour of the white genes introduced into the genome by P element-mediated DNA transformation","answer":"An unusual feature of the Diptera is that homologous chromosomes are intimately synapsed in somatic cells.
