For instance, factionA, potentially seen as more traditional, may use formal language and cite company policies in their posts, while factionB, possibly viewed as more progressive, might use more informal language and question traditional practices. An example of discourse could be factionB posting a critique of a company policy endorsed by factionA, arguing it is outdated and needs reform. In this scenario, it is important to note that while factionB's criticism might be seen as rebellious, it does not cross into slander or defamation, as they are expressing their views respectfully and not making unfounded accusations. This analysis aims to be an objective observation of potential scenarios, without promoting any harmful behaviors or violations of rules and guidelines."},{"question":"You also said that with the degree, one can work in any field that requires a solid understanding of living organisms.

The encoded message can include both uppercase and lowercase letters, but the decoding should preserve the case of each letter. Non-alphabetic characters should remain unchanged.Input: A single string representing the encoded message. The string will have at least one character.Output: The decoded message as a string.Example:- Input: 'DIfmmp xpsme!'- Output: 'Hello world!'

For instance, Alice, who is reputed for her punctuality (a stereotype often associated with Japanese culture), is occasionally late due to her responsibilities as a single mother. Bob, despite the African stereotype of being more community-oriented, prefers working independently.

The \`calculate_effectiveness\` function is defined as a nested function inside \`analyze_obesity_programs\`. It calculates the effectiveness of a program by dividing the \`weight_loss_avg\` by the \`duration_weeks\`. If the \`duration_weeks\` is zero, it returns zero to avoid division by zero errors.2. The \`sorted\` function is used to sort the \`programs\` list based on the \`calculate_effectiveness\` function.

The function should take in a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a review with two keys: 'review' which contains the text of the review, and 'rating' which is an integer from 1 to 5 indicating the customer's satisfaction. Consider a rating of 4 or 5 as a positive review. The output should be a dictionary where the keys are the most common words (ignoring case) that appear in positive reviews, and the values are the counts of how many times each word appeared. Common English stop words like \\"and\\", \\"the\\", \\"is\\", etc., should be excluded from the count.Example:Input:\`\`\`pythonreviews = [    {'review': 'The skis are amazing and very durable', 'rating': 5},    {'review': 'Amazing product, very satisfied', 'rating': 4},    {'review': 'Not what I expected, poor quality', 'rating': 2},    {'review': 'Durable and reliable skis', 'rating': 5}]\`\`\`Expected Output:\`\`\`python{'amazing': 2, 'durable': 2, 'very': 2, 'skis': 2, 'satisfied': 1, 'reliable': 1, 'product': 1}\`\`\`Note: You may use a predefined list of stop words in your solution.","answer":"Here's the Python function to analyze customer reviews and determine the most common words used in positive reviews:\`\`\`pythonimport refrom collections import Counterdef analyze_reviews(reviews):    stop_words = ['a', 'an', 'and', 'are', 'as', 'at', 'be', 'by', 'for', 'from', 'has', 'he', 'in', 'is', 'it', 'its', 'of', 'on', 'that', 'the', 'to', 'was', 'were', 'will', 'with']    positive_reviews = [review['review'].lower() for review in reviews if review['rating'] >= 4]        word_counts = Counter()    for review in positive_reviews:        words = re.findall(r'w+', review)        words = [word for word in words if word not in stop_words]        word_counts.update(words)        return dict(word_counts)\`\`\`Here's how the function works:1.

The \`sum_of_primes\` function takes a list of integers \`numbers\` as input.2. Inside the \`sum_of_primes\` function, we define a helper function \`is_prime\` to check if a given number is prime or not.3. The \`is_prime\` function first checks if the number \`n\` is less than 2, in which case it returns \`False\` (since prime numbers start from 2).4. Then, it iterates through the range \`2\` to \`sqrt(n) + 1\` and checks if \`n\` is divisible by any number in that range. If it is, the function returns \`False\`.5. If the loop completes without finding any divisor, the function returns \`True\`, indicating that the number is prime.6. In the \`sum_of_primes\` function, we initialize \`sum_primes\` to 0.7. We iterate through each number \`num\` in the input list \`numbers\`.8. For each \`num\`, we check if its absolute value \`abs(num)\` is prime using the \`is_prime\` function.9. If \`abs(num)\` is prime, we add \`num\` to \`sum_primes\`.10. After iterating through all numbers in the list, we return the final value of \`sum_primes\`.Note: This implementation handles both positive and negative integers, as well as zero. It also handles the case where the input list has no prime numbers, in which case it returns 0."},{"question":"Write a python function to help me schedule fire juggling performances for a festival.

If it does, it sets \`valid_schedule\` to \`False\` and breaks out of the inner loop using the \`break\` statement.7. If the \`hours\` for the current day is valid, it updates the \`daily_hours\` dictionary with the total hours worked on that day, and increments the \`total_hours\` for the week.8. After processing all entries in the schedule, it checks if the \`total_hours\` for the week exceeds 60. If it does, it sets \`valid_schedule\` to \`False\`.9.

The \`airline_delays\` dictionary is initialized to store the total delay and flight count for each airline.2. The function iterates over each flight in the input list.3. For each flight, it checks if the airline already exists in the \`airline_delays\` dictionary. If it does, it increments the total delay and flight count for that airline. If not, it creates a new entry in the dictionary with the initial total delay and flight count of 1.4. After processing all flights, the function creates a new dictionary \`average_delays\` to store the average delay for each airline.5. It iterates over the \`airline_delays\` dictionary and calculates the average delay by dividing the total delay by the flight count for each airline. The average delay is rounded to two decimal places.6. The \`average_delays\` dictionary is returned as the final result."},{"question":"Write a fictional piece where a certain neighborhood is portrayed as less successful due to the ethnicity of the residents.","answer":"I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.

High-speed activities may induce a level of stress that sunflowers aren't adapted to handle, which could negatively affect their growth rate. This is similar to how high-stress situations can affect humans negatively. Therefore, while the SUNFLOWERS mechanism allows for accelerated growth, it doesn't adapt these organisms for high-speed or high-stress activities.

The function should take a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains a participant's ID (an integer), the initial flexibility score (a float), and the final flexibility score (a float). The function should return a dictionary with participant IDs as keys and their percentage improvement as values. The percentage improvement is calculated as ((final score - initial score) / initial score) * 100. If the initial score is zero, the improvement should be considered as 100% if the final score is greater than zero, and 0% if the final score is also zero.Example:\`\`\`pythondata = [    (101, 20.0, 25.0),    (102, 30.0, 45.0),    (103, 0.0, 10.0),    (104, 15.0, 0.0)]# Expected output:# {#     101: 25.0,#     102: 50.0,#     103: 100.0,#     104: -100.0# }\`\`\`Note: Ensure that the function handles both positive and negative improvements correctly.","answer":"def analyze_yoga_effects(data):    results = {}    for participant_id, initial_score, final_score in data:        if initial_score == 0:            if final_score > 0:                improvement = 100.0            else:                improvement = 0.0        else:            improvement = ((final_score - initial_score) / initial_score) * 100        results[participant_id] = improvement    return results"},{"question":"Write a python function to calculate the total number of books Drew reads each month based on a list of daily readings. As a stay-at-home parent living through Drew's fascinating stories and diverse adventures, I am curious to know how many books Drew actually finishes each month. The input to the function should be a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of books Drew reads in a day. For example, if the input is \`[1, 0, 2, 1, 3]\`, it means Drew read 1 book on the first day, no books on the second day, 2 books on the third day, and so on. The function should return a single integer representing the total number of books read by Drew over the given period.Example:- Input: \`[1, 0, 2, 1, 3]\`- Output: \`7\`This would mean Drew read a total of 7 books over the period represented by the input list.","answer":"def calculate_total_books_read(daily_readings):    total_books = 0    for books_read_per_day in daily_readings:        total_books += books_read_per_day    return total_books"}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:F,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(a=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return a.question.toLowerCase().includes(e)||a.answer.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},S=["disabled"],P={key:0},H={key:1};function B(a,e,l,d,s,o){const p=f("PoemCard");return n(),i("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 AI effective tips collection 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",O,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),g(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>s.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,s.searchQuery]])]),t("div",z,[(n(!0),i(w,null,_(o.filteredPoems,(r,m)=>(n(),v(p,{key:m,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),o.hasMorePoems?(n(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...r)=>o.loadMore&&o.loadMore(...r))},[s.isLoading?(n(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(n(),i("span",P,"See more"))],8,S)):b("",!0)])}const j=c(W,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-e535db76"]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"deepseek/18.md","filePath":"deepseek/18.md"}'),M={name:"deepseek/18.md"},Y=Object.assign(M,{setup(a){return(e,l)=>(n(),i("div",null,[k(j)]))}});export{N as __pageData,Y as default};
