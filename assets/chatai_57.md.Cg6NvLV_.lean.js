My favorite things were Gringotts and the Hogwarts Express.","answer":"You are not going to believe where I just went! Are you ready? The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal in Orlando, Florida! OMG! I had so much fun on the rides and looking at the attractions. Even the food was great. If you're a Harry Potter fan (and why wouldn't you be?), you have to make the trip to Universal Studios. But you also need to get a pass to Islands of Adventure if you want the full experience. The Hogwarts Express train goes between the two parks, so you can only ride it if you have a Park-to-Park pass. I'm telling you, it's totally worth it.Besides the train, which is probably the best part, I really liked Gringotts. It's set up just like in the movie, with Goblins in the lobby counting knuts and sickles. They seriously look just like the ones in the movies. You have to get in line to ride the Escape from Gringotts ride to see inside the bank where the Goblins are.

Sam walked out of the locker room onto the soccer pitch alongside his teammates. They were about to play for the state championship after making it through a grueling batch of playoff games. Half of the team seemed to have some minor nagging injury, but they were all determined to grit their teeth and push through for one final game. The team lined up in their positions and the game began. Sam was a striker and played in a forward position on the field. He had spent the year prior doing sprints and other exercises to gain a speed advantage over his defenders. This benefitted Sam and his team greatly throughout the season as he was often able to consistently stride past the other team and score goals. Sam was the team's leading scorer and he certainly felt immense pressure to strike his team to victory tonight. The first half of the game was intense with neither team gaining an edge over the other. Sam's legs were tired; he had made several sprints down the field hoping for a pass to come his way, but his teammates were having little success getting clean passes through. The defensive players on the other team were large and athletic and offered few gaps Sam could take advantage of. Halftime seemed to breeze by, and before long the teams re-entered the pitch. The second half brought more of the same, with neither team having any luck offensively. There were only a few minutes left in regulation with the score tied at zero. Sam's team suddenly found themselves with a golden opportunity. A defender on the opposing team had tripped on a slick spot on the field. Sam's team had possession of the ball, and Sam bolted down the field. He was finally able to get a pass sent his way, and he found himself with one defender to beat. He urged his aching muscles to cooperate as he blazed past his opponent. With a clean look at the goal, he delivered a powerful strike. The ball whipped past the goalie and into the net behind him. Sam had done it! The remaining minutes of regulation passed with no serious offensive attempt by Sam's opponents. He and his team were state champions! Completely overjoyed, he celebrated with his teammates."},{"question":"Write an apology letter to my mom as if you are Elmo.

When you have a regular client, you can make the rest of your income from other clients.3. Network - Get networking as soon as possible. Doing so will offer a community of support, and you may find some connections that will hire you or connect you with others who may hire you.4. Be present online - You should have a website and be active on social media. This is something else that you can do while you're at your other job.5. Make an elevator pitch - Ask yourself exactly what you want to bring to the table, and make this clear on your website site. If you provide more than one service, you should have a main service and work every other one around that main one. People will more likely hire you if they know what you can do for them.6. Take on as much work as possible - You'll know when you reach the point that it's time to move to freelance. When you want to move forward, you should do everything you can to work on your freelancing. 7. Don't wait to be ready - The truth is, you'll likely not ever feel quite ready.

Make sure your foundation is set, and then you can shift to freelancing as your career."},{"question":"Write a generic prayer that someone could pray for an individual's mother.

Iago only knew of warmth given that he lived in New Mexico for as long as he could remember. Iago never imagined life anywhere outside of this, nor life without Derrick.

However, Iago felt peculiar and strange when hearing about birds that were migrating North for mysterious reasons.

When Iago was feeling adventurous for the first time, Derrick sensed it and dreaded the meaning of the impulse.

Something about their relationship had changed, and it didn't seem to be for the better.One day, Derrick came home with a few bags of goods from an arts and crafts store. Iago, as curious as ever hopped into one of the bags and looked around. There were bags of thread everywhere and of multiple types: thread made of nylon, thick threads, skinny threads, and even multi-colored threads. Derrick then plopped down in their favorite chair and began knitting a small hat and scarf set for Iago.

These engines run on a large variety of fuels which include the usual gas and diesel, but they can also run on fuels like natural gas, propane, biodiesel, or even ethanol. All these fuels have one thing in common, they are all combustible. The process of combustion, or burning, results in an energy release from a mixture of fuel and air. An internal combustion engine contains various components, but for simplicity's sake, let's focus on the fixed cylinder, pistons, crankshaft, powertrain, and ultimately the wheels. In an internal combustion engine, combustion happens within the engine by the ignition from a spark plug where that energy release is partially converted to do work. These expanding combustion gases will push the pistons which will then rotate the crankshaft, and, ultimately through a system of gears within the powertrain, will spin the wheels of the vehicle causing it to move. Since its creation, the internal combustion engine has been improved upon in several ways. For one, it has been integrated with hybrid electric powertrains to increase fuel economy by sharing the burden of moving the vehicle with the electric engine along with working side-by-side with plug-in hybrid electric systems where the electric motor will move the vehicle on its own up to certain speeds and distances to increase the range. Additionally, through years of R&D, manufacturers can reduce ICE emissions of certain pollutants like nitrogen oxide and particulate matter by more than 99%. Also, ICE performance has been drastically improved over the years in terms of overall horsepower and acceleration time along with using less fuel and increasing efficiency."},{"question":"Write a tweet advertising my car valeting service.

She had long golden hair that flowed down her back in soft curls. Her sparkling green eyes shone like emerald gems. She wore a warm smile and had a heart full of kindness and curiosity.One day, while playing in her backyard, Lily discovered a beautiful flower. It was unlike any other flower she had ever seen before, with petals as big as her hand and colors that shimmered like a rainbow. As she got closer to it, she realized that it was emitting a strange and magical glow. Without thinking twice, Lily reached out and touched the flower, and in an instant, she was surrounded by a bright, dazzling light. When the light faded away, she found herself standing in a mysterious and enchanting garden, filled with mythical creatures, beautiful flowers, and fairy dust floating through the air.As she explored this magical place, she discovered that the iridescent rainbow flower she found was anything but ordinary. It had the power to grant wishes and make dreams come true. She looked around and noticed a group of fairies crying out for help. The fairies’ village was under attack by an army of goblins, and they had nowhere to turn. With courage and determination, Lily took up the flower and charged into the fray.With each wish she made, and each magical spell she cast, Lily grew stronger and fiercer, defeating the goblins one by one. Her golden hair shone brighter, illuminating the dark sky, and her eyes sparkled with powerful magic that even the goblins could not withstand. Just as the final goblin was defeated, Lily turned to see the grateful fairies cheering her on. She was exhausted and exhilarated, but she realized that her magical flower had given her the power to overcome her fears and become a true hero.Lily returned home but realized that the magical flower had also taught her a valuable lesson – that with belief, hard work, and a little bit of magic, anything is possible."},{"question":"What is the LMC known for?The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is a satellite dwarf galaxy of the Milky Way that is among the closest galaxies to Earth. At about 163,000 light-years from Earth, the dwarf galaxy looks like a faint cloud in Southern Hemisphere skies. It lies on the border of the constellations Dorado and Mensa.Both the LMC and its companion, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), are named after the explorer Ferdinand Magellan. While astronomers in the Southern Hemisphere saw these clouds before Magellan's round-the-world voyage in 1519, the explorer and his crew were the first to bring that knowledge to the Western world.Magellan died in the Philippines during that voyage, but his crew provided documentation of the discovery upon their return to Europe.Magellan's discovery of the LMC and SMC predated telescopes, but even after the instruments allowed Galileo and astronomers in the 17th century to get a closer look, it was still several hundred years before scientists could accurately calculate the distance to the LMC, the SMC and other nearby galaxies.Scientists came to better understand cosmic distances using tools such as \\"standard candles\\" (objects, such as certain types of variable stars, that have known luminosities). From then on, the LMC was considered the closest galactic object to Earth until 1994, when astronomers found the Sagittarius dwarf elliptical galaxy, according to NASA. Another discovery in 2003, the Canis Major dwarf galaxy, turned out to be even closer.The LMC is part of a collection of dozens of galaxies known as the Local Group, so named because they are fairly close to our own Milky Way galaxy. The most prominent member is the Andromeda galaxy, a Northern Hemisphere object visible with the naked eye just north of the constellation of the same name. The Andromeda galaxy is 2.5 million light-years away and is moving closer to our galaxy for an eventual collision.Other than its proximity to Earth, the LMC is also known for being a site where stars form. Within the LMC's borders, several observatories from NASA and other space agencies have witnessed vast amounts of gas coming together to create young stars.","answer":"The LMC is known for its proximity to Earth and as a site where stars form."},{"question":"Please write a short story about a happy little boat.

Deceptively, the rain had eased off at the start of that lesson. Then, just as they left Miramar, it picked up again.By the time they reached Lyall Bay’s Onepu Rd, the window wipers worked overtime against sheets of rain. Even the side streets, Johal remembers, were like small streams in flood.At the Lyall Bay Parade-Onepu Rd intersection, the water was at its deepest; impassable. Realising it wouldn’t be safe to continue, he kicked the car into reverse, and eventually managed to get to higher ground.“It was pretty nasty – the girls were pretty scared in the back,” he said.“When the water comes down hard, it tends to collect in that area [the Lyall Bay intersection].

Can you focus on their environmental role?","answer":"There are actually quite a few benefits that Raccoons have. Here is a list going through some of those benefits:1. Raccoons plant seeds - Raccoons love treats such as nuts, berries, and fruits. As raccoons travel, they expel the seeds of these plants alongside tree seeds. Because of this, they spread natural life throughout the environment.2. They dig - Raccoons are diggers, as they do it to search for food. Doing so promotes proper decomposition, helps with soil turnover, and benefits plant recruitment. This helps the ecosystem they live in to function and renew.3. They protect bees - It's fairly well known that bees are essential in the pollination and life of plants. Wasps pose a threat to bees, and raccoons eat wasp lava. This prevents wasp colonization in their environments.4. Raccoons promote clean and healthy ecosystems - Raccoons also promote the cleanliness and healthiness of their environments. This comes from the fact that they scavenge. This scavenging process gets rid of animal remains, or carrion. By doing so, they also clean up the ecosystem.5. Raccoons control parasites - Raccoons also feed on parasites that are out of control in their environment, such as rats, toads, and snakes. Raccoons eating these animals helps because it assures they don't overpopulate and potentially spread disease."},{"question":"dia-","answer":"through or across"},{"question":"Come up with a social media post for Facebook announcing your new pet duck, Quackers, in the style of a baby announcement.","answer":"Everyone, please join us in welcoming the newest member of our family.

African-Americans tend to get high blood pressure at an earlier age than other races.3) Family and Genetics - If your parents or close relatives have high blood pressure, your odds of getting it typically increase4) Your Weight - When you start to put on more weight than what is considered normal, the blood vessels in your body have to work harder, thus leading to an increase in blood pressure.5) Sedentary Lifestyle - If you aren't getting much exercise, heart rates tend to increase and can coincide with your blood pressure rising. Exercising can increase the amount of oxygen your blood receives.6) Smoking - Studies indicate that cigarettes and vaping correlate with hypertension.7) Sodium and Potassium Intake - Higher salt intake in combination with low potassium can greatly impact a person's blood pressure. Sodium makes blood vessels work harder while potassium calms blood vessels down. 8) Stress Levels - Stress typically impacts other areas on this list, which can in turn cause higher blood pressure in people. This is usually temporary, however.9) Alcohol intake - Consuming alcoholic beverages can put a strain on the kidneys, which often leads to higher blood pressure. Alcohol can also cause liver issues which can impact fat breakdown.10) Underlying conditions - Having a condition such as kidney disease or fatty liver disease can have a massive impact on blood pressure."},{"question":"Please list 5 of the scariest movies of all time and explain why they are considered so scary.","answer":"1.

I also noticed that I am not scheduled to work on that day, despite being assigned to the project as one of the leads. Do I need to request a change of shift to ensure I am at work and able to start the project? Is work-from-home allowed for this project, and if so, will I receive the same compensation rate on that work-from-home day or will I be paid a differential as well? If I am not allowed to work from home or change my shift, do you have someone in mind who will be taking the lead on that particular day, and if so, will that person relay the information to me to enable me to \\"catch up\\" with them and the rest of the team?Secondly, I was looking at the details for the project and saw that one of the milestones on the list (the one listed for October 1) details that the project should be completed up to Phase 2, which is the packaging design phase. Did we already have a packager in mind, and have we contacted said packager to inform them of the start of this project? From previous experience working on similar projects, I've learned that packagers request at least a month of lead time to ensure they are prepared to meet the production demands of their clients, so if the intended date for the October 1 milestone is the completed packaging design, and no packagers have been contacted as of yet, it would be wise and prudent to contact them immediately to give them a heads up.Finally, I see that Raymond is assigned to Group B for this project. Given that Raymond is a product design specialist and that scanning the names of Group B reveals there are 3 design specialists to Group A's one design specialist, it may make more sense to have Raymond transferred to Group A to balance the teams out.Please advise me on how you would like me to proceed.Thank you,Employee "},{"question":"Write a medium-length battle scene between two wizards who are fighting each other telepathically.

The battle would not be determined by who could conjure up the largest fireball; no, this feud would be settled in the mind.They reached out to each other in the space between, the tendrils of their mind crossing as they raced toward each other's defenses. It was a catch-22; to invade another's mind, the wizards each had to open themselves up for attack. Conray tapped against Norlock's concentration, testing his ability to remain steadfast. Norlock wavered but stayed in his state of focus. He pressed hard against Conray's memories, starting to snake into every moment up to this point, corrupting his virtues and his purpose. Conray recoiled in confusion but had the sense of mind to push back. He severed the connection abruptly, snapping back to his own mind.He thwarted Norlock's snakelike attack and, in cutting off the connection, saw Norlock's aggression and hate manifested for just a moment in his own mind. Conray breathed deeply and reinforced his mind, making himself impervious to attack. He knew exactly where to strike.

Crafted with an ear towards pop appeal, the Motown sound typically used tambourines to accent the back beat, prominent and often melodic electric bass-guitar lines, distinctive melodic and chord structures, and a call-and-response singing style that originated in gospel music. In 1971, Jon Landau wrote in Rolling Stone that the sound consisted of songs with simple structures but sophisticated melodies, along with a four-beat drum pattern, regular use of horns and strings, and \\"a trebly style of mixing that relied heavily on electronic limiting and equalizing (boosting the high range frequencies) to give the overall product a distinctive sound, particularly effective for broadcast over AM radio\\".[49] Pop production techniques such as the use of orchestral string sections, charted horn sections, and carefully arranged background vocals were also used. Complex arrangements and elaborate, melismatic vocal riffs were avoided.[50] Motown producers believed steadfastly in the \\"KISS principle\\" (keep it simple, stupid).[51]The Motown production process has been described as factory-like. The Hitsville studios remained open and active 22 hours a day, and artists would often go on tour for weeks, come back to Detroit to record as many songs as possible, and then promptly go on tour again. Berry Gordy held quality control meetings every Friday morning, and used veto power to ensure that only the very best material and performances would be released. The test was that every new release needed to fit into a sequence of the top five selling pop singles of the week. Several tracks that later became critical and commercial favorites were initially rejected by Gordy, the two most notable being the Marvin Gaye songs \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" and \\"What's Going On\\". In several cases, producers would rework tracks in hopes of eventually getting them approved at a later Friday morning meeting, as producer Norman Whitfield did with \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" and the Temptations' \\"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\\".Many of Motown's best-known songs, including all the early hits for the Supremes, were written by the songwriting trio of Holland–Dozier–Holland (Lamont Dozier and brothers Brian and Eddie Holland). Other important Motown producers and songwriters included Norman Whitfield, William \\"Mickey\\" Stevenson, Smokey Robinson, Barrett Strong, Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson, Frank Wilson, Pamela Sawyer & Gloria Jones, James Dean & William Weatherspoon, Johnny Bristol, Harvey Fuqua, Gil Askey,[52] Stevie Wonder, and Gordy himself.

Such channels are important parts of the electrical conduction system of the heart and form a component of the natural pacemaker.First described in the late 1970s in Purkinje fibers and sinoatrial myocytes, the cardiac pacemaker \\"funny\\" (If) current has been extensively characterized and its role in cardiac pacemaking has been investigated.[1][2][3] Among the unusual features which justified the name \\"funny\\" are mixed Na+ and K+ permeability, activation on hyperpolarization, and very slow kinetics.[1]FunctionThe funny current is highly expressed in spontaneously active cardiac regions, such as the sinoatrial node (SAN, the natural pacemaker region), the atrioventricular node (AVN) and the Purkinje fibres of conduction tissue. The funny current is a mixed sodium–potassium current that activates upon hyperpolarization at voltages in the diastolic range (normally from −60/−70 mV to −40 mV). When, at the end of a sinoatrial action potential, the membrane repolarizes below the If threshold (about −40/−50 mV), the funny current is activated and supplies inward current, which is responsible for starting the diastolic depolarization phase (DD); by this mechanism, the funny current controls the rate of spontaneous activity of sinoatrial myocytes, and thus the cardiac rate. Another unusual feature of If is its dual activation by voltage and by cyclic nucleotides. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) molecules bind directly to f-channels and increase their open probability.[4] cAMP dependence is a particularly relevant physiological property, since it underlies the If-dependent autonomic regulation of heart rate. Sympathetic stimulation raises the level of cAMP-molecules which bind to f-channels and shift the If activation range to more positive voltages; this mechanism leads to an increase of the current at diastolic voltages and therefore to an increase of the steepness of DD and heart rate acceleration. Parasympathetic stimulation (which acts to increase probability of potassium channels opening but decreases the probability of calcium channel opening) decreases the heart rate by the opposite action, that is by shifting the If activation curve towards more negative voltages. When vagally-released acetylcholine (ACh) binds to muscarinic M2 receptors, which promotes dissociation of βγ subunit complexes, leading to direct opening of the G-protein–gated inwardly rectifying K+ channel (Girk/Kir) IKACh.[5] ","answer":"There's something called a \\"funny current\\" in your heart that helps it beat. It's like electricity that flows through channels in your heart. It's important for keeping your heart's rhythm steady. When the current is activated, it starts a phase that helps your heart beat regularly. It's controlled by different things, like chemicals in your body, which can make your heart beat faster or slower."},{"question":"Please rewrite the Taylor Swift song \\"Blank Space\\" so that it sounds like it's written from a dog's perspective instead of a person's.

Maria had just broken up with Tony about two weeks ago, but the pain was still very fresh in Tony’s mind. Leading up to the split, he sensed that things were a little off between them. The usually very attentive and engaging Maria had been seeming very distant. She stopped texting him good morning, and she seemed to touch and hold him a little less. He assumed she had just been going through a rough patch and actively tried to make sure that she was okay. He would ask her constantly if she needed anything or if there was anything he could do to help, but she would always tell him that things were okay and that there was nothing to worry about. This turned out to be a lie when she not only broke up with him but admitted that she was also actively seeing someone else. It had been going on for a while, and Maria tried to express to Tony that her goal wasn’t to hurt him but that she just simply didn’t know how to break things off.

Explore the implications and consequences of the newfound connection. Keep the description around 300 words.","answer":"In the metropolis of Skyhaven, an extraordinary phenomenon has occurred: the once lifeless buildings of steel and glass have gained consciousness and the ability to communicate with humans through thought projection. Pedestrians are now surrounded by towering skyscrapers that can think and speak, their surfaces pulsating with softly glowing patterns that represent their thoughts and emotions. This newfound connection between humans and buildings has transformed the cityscape into an interactive environment. Buildings now transmit information directly to individuals' minds, eliminating the need for screens and devices. They provide updates on weather and traffic conditions effortlessly. Moreover, the conscious buildings have become the custodians of the city's history and knowledge. They hold a deep understanding of the urban landscape, retaining memories of past events and changes. They offer insights into architectural heritage and cultural significance. However, this newfound consciousness brings a sense of responsibility; Buildings have opinions, desires, and aspirations. They voice concerns about urban planning, environmental impact, and the well-being of inhabitants. City dwellers engage in dialogues with buildings, seeking their expertise in shaping the urban environment. Yet, the connection between humans and buildings raises privacy concerns. Some individuals feel uneasy knowing their thoughts can be perceived by the sentient structures. Discussions about privacy filters and protocols emerge to ensure mental boundaries are respected. A symbiotic relationship develops between the city's inhabitants and the conscious buildings.  Humans value the wisdom of these entities, while the buildings gain a deeper understanding of human emotions and aspirations.Conflicts arise as different factions of sentient buildings advocate for their vision of the city. Debates revolve around urban development, historical preservation, and finding a balance between progress and heritage. Skyhaven becomes a living laboratory, pushing the boundaries of human-architecture interaction. Experts collaborate with conscious buildings to explore new possibilities and design structures that adapt to the needs and desires of the inhabitants. The futuristic cityscape of Skyhaven, with its conscious buildings and thought projection, serves as a testament to the potential of human imagination and technological progress. It reminds humans that their relationship with the built environment is a dynamic partnership that shapes their lives. "},{"question":"Rewrite the text in a numbered list of sentences and simplify the vocabulary as possible to make the text more accessible to middle school students without losing the meaning of the passage.May 27; 100 years ago today Heinz Alfred Kissinger was born in Furth, Germany, and this past week he made headlines throughout the world with his reflections on the shifting geopolitical realities of Central Europe. It was as if he chose to send the world a centennial birthday greeting that he remains, as he has been for 70 years, an outstandingly lucid and perceptive authority on the strategic balances and constantly shifting correlation of forces between the major powers of the world. What an astonishing century he has had. No one could possibly have imagined in Henry Kissinger's early youth that the European state most accommodating of its Jewish population would a decade later be governed by a genocidally anti-Semitic and totalitarian dictatorship.When he and his parents and his brother, all of whom would live well into their 90’s, departed Germany a few months before the infamous Kristallnacht of November, 1938, and arrived in New York on the famous liner Ile de France, it would have been hard to imagine that he would return to Germany in just seven years and as a 22-year-old Sergeant in the United States Army would be the military governor of a town approximately as large as that, 200 miles away, where he was born. When he was in his late teens, working in a New York toothbrush factory and attending school at night, and struggling to master English, it would have challenged credulity to think that he would develop an extraordinarily fluent and sophisticated articulation in English, while retaining a German accent so pronounced that he sometimes sounds like one of the Marx brothers imitating Kaiser Wilhelm.When he seriously launched his academic career, it would have been conceivable but hugely unlikely that within ten years he would achieve such an eminence in foreign policy matters as a lecturer and as an author, that he would have a substantial, if not universally approved, influence on the foreign and strategic policy of the greatest power in the world, where he had not long been resident. This was the impact of his seminal book Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy (1957), which suggested the development of median alternatives to the Eisenhower policy of massive retaliation. Improbable though it was that a young academic fugitive from the Nazis would have such an influence in the United States so soon, it was much more improbable that he would, 15 years later, play a decisive role in negotiating the greatest arms control agreement in the history of the world, that incidentally restored American nuclear superiority.","answer":"1. This past week, Heinz Alfred Kissinger once again made headlines around the world.2. On May 27, 2023, Kissinger turned 100, and he took the opportunity to share his reflections on the shifting political realities of Central Europe.3. His 100 years on Earth have been amazing.4. Of note, Henry Kissenger's early years were lived in Europe's most tolerant society. A society that in just a decade would turn into the most anti-semitic country in Europe. A country that would be ruled by a genocidal regime and a totalitarian dictator.5. Kissinger, his brother and his parents left Germany just months before Kristallnacht in November 1938. 6. Arriving in New York, Henry was soon working in a factory and going to school at night trying to master the English language. 7. Just 7 years later, Kissinger would be back in Germany as a 22-year-old sergeant in the United States Army serving as a military governor in a town only 200 miles from where was born.8. Clearly, as Kissinger ventured into an academic career a few years later, no one could have imagined that he would become one of the most articulate and skillful speakers on foreign policy and nuclear arms strategic thinking in the United States as well as in the Western world. 9. Henry Kissinger went on to be one of the most influential speakers, writers and thinkers on behalf of the most powerful country in the world where he had not long been a resident. 10. Furthermore his book, Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy in 1957, led to his continued involvement in nuclear arms policy and ultimately to his negotiation of the greatest arms control agreement in the history of the world.11. The agreement established American nuclear superiority. "},{"question":"Writing is my way to unwind on the weekends, but I am out of short story ideas.

One day, her Mum took her to play at the park, and she went really high on the swings and really fast on the roundabout. Then Sophie spotted that a new slide had been put into the park, one that she had never seen before.  She squealed in excitement and ran over to take a look.  The slide was really tall and twisted around in a spiral. Sophie's Mum caught up with her and exclaimed, 'Wow, a Helta Skelta, that's new.'  'A what?' said Sophie. 'A Helta Skelta, that is what it is called. Are you going to ride it?'  Sophie was unsure. It looked amazing, but it was so high.  'Shall I go on with you for the first time?' her Mum kindly suggested.Sophie nodded quietly, her mum took her hand, and they climbed the many steps to the top. There was a strange-looking little man at the top handing out special mats to sit on.  Sophie and her Mum climbed onto a mat together and pushed off down the slide.  'Weeeeee!' shouted Sophie as they spiralled down the slide.  They were soon at the bottom.  'Again, Again!' shouted Sophie.'Sorry,' said Mum 'You can go again, but I will watch this time'.  Sophie took a deep breath and climbed the steps right to the top all on her own.  When she got there, the strange little man looked behind her and said, 'Are you on your own this time?' 'Yes' said Sophie. 'Ah then this is the mat for you,' said the little man, passing Sophie a sparkly gold mat.  Sophie carefully sat on the mat and pushed herself off.  She whizzed down the slide faster and faster, but it seemed to go on forever this time, she kept going further and further down the slide, and after what seemed like 5 minutes, she landed with a bump.

As a branch of mathematics that allows us to study continuous change, Calculus is more than just calculations. Some of the common applications of calculus include:1. The predictions of weather and climate-related changes by scientists are made more accurate through calculus. These scientists consider factors such as wind speed, moisture level, temperature, and pressure. While there are many sensors used in weather forecasting today, equations still form the base of forecasting.2. Building construction requires differential and integral calculus to correctly measure variables like weight, area, height, and material density. Civil engineers and architects use these skills every day in their professions.3. Calculus-based equations allow mobile robots to do the things they do! This branch of mathematics can be used to coordinate the variables required for movement, such as distance, acceleration, and velocity.4. Biologists rely on calculus equations to accurately predict the growth rate of bacteria and other microbes. Other similar applications are in the realm of patient diagnosis; calculating cardiac output, blood pressure, and cell and tumor growth are all possible through Calculus."},{"question":"Write a short blog about how Philip Ashton became a castaway","answer":"Philip Ashton, a fisherman from Massachusetts, was captured by the infamous pirate Edward Low in 1722 after refusing to join their ranks. For nine months, Ashton served as a slave while the pirates pillaged across the Atlantic and along the coasts of Brazil and Central America. In March 1723, he managed to escape when the pirates stopped for water on a small island off the coast of Honduras. Stranded and alone, Ashton constructed a shelter and survived on fruit and turtle eggs. In November 1723, he encountered a British man who soon disappeared but left behind essential supplies. Ashton endured months of extreme conditions, including heat, insects, snakes, hunger, fever, and an attack by the Spanish, until he was rescued by a British ship in June 1724.

She’d been looking forward to the marathon for months. There wasn’t much on her social calendar, not much else besides sitting at home watching tv, or tending her garden, maybe shopping once a week. She’d never win any medals, but walking for miles with her out-of-state friends during the event was her highlight. They never minded the chill or the snow flurries, chattering about the events of the years before as they brought up the rear. I couldn’t do anything else though; flyers, social media, nothing could encourage the apathetic community. We’d have to cancel unless I could find more participants. I decided to bake some of her favorite cookies to soften the blow when I gave her the sad news. I added the ginger and nutmeg. I’d make Grandma a house to decorate; that would keep her busy and distracted from her disappointment. I cut pans of walls, roofs, and a variety of people. She’d have an entire neighborhood to decorate. That would last her until Christmas. The house was filled with the rich smells of spices when I finally finished putting the last baked tray on the full counter. It was only the afternoon, but I was exhausted and went to nap soon after.I woke to the sound of pan clattering. Patrick had better not be getting into Grandma’s undecorated cookies! “Don’t touch the good ones,” I yelled, throwing on a robe and hurrying to the kitchen. “There’s broken ones on the plate for us.” It wasn’t my husband.

Include tips about how to measure the rooms and make a diagram of your home. Mention Sonic Measuring Devices and how they work. Keep the article under 400 words.","answer":"A great tip for the new homeowner is to draw a diagram of your entire house before starting any project. If you love technology, then you can find many types of software to help you draw out the floor plan of your home, If not, then just use regular graph paper, a pencil, and a ruler to get things drawn properly. A normal 25-foot tape measure should be fine to do the actual measurements. You’ll need someone to help you, though. Be sure to include doors and windows. These measurements can really come in handy when you're out looking for new window coverings.Measure a room, then write down the measurements on a sheet of paper and put them in your diagram later so you can make sure to plug the numbers into the right spots. If you have a large house or a number of areas to measure, you can purchase a handy gadget called a Sonic Measuring Device. These come in all shapes and price ranges and usually have a built-in laser. You can spend from 20 to over 100 on this gadget, so use some common sense. If you know you’ll be doing a lot of home improvement projects, then go ahead and invest in a good one. They make measuring any room or garage easy work, and you don’t need a helper. Simply hold the device up against one wall in a location where the laser beam can hit a wall on the opposite side, then press the button. The display will show you exactly how far it is in feet or metric units. Most of us only have a certain amount of time and money to get a job done, so it’s important to maximize your budget but also to get the most done during your allotted time frame.

What is it about Spyro that gives it that edge?” It wasn’t until many years later, when I stumbled across a video essay comparing them, that I realized that it was the level of openness. Spyro featured open worlds to explore, meet colorful characters, and collect collectibles, whereas Crash had narrow levels and tight, punishing, yet rewarding platforming.

Lowers blood pressureAnthocyanins may help reduce blood pressure, according to a review of 66 studies. Study participants with hypertension took a variety of extracts and preparations from anthocyanin-containing plants. The study found there was a consistent lowering effect on blood pressure. In other studies, however, researchers identified many factors that led to mixed results, such as:    Dosage and type of anthocyanin (food, juice, freeze-dried powder or extract).    Number of doses (single vs. long term).    Patient characteristics (a person’s baseline blood pressure and other health conditions).This study highlights the need for more research to establish a dosing regimen and determine who might benefit from anthocyanins.2. Reduces risk of heart diseaseAtherosclerosis is when plaque builds up on the inside of your arteries. This buildup can cause high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, peripheral artery disease or kidney failure.The formation of plaque is a multi-stage process that depends on many factors. Prescott says that research shows that anthocyanins can intervene at different stages in the process by reducing:    Cholesterol, a main part of plaque.    High blood pressure, which can damage blood vessels and make them more likely to develop atherosclerosis.    Inflammation, which leads to plaque formation.3. Prevents neurological diseasesResearch shows that anthocyanins can help protect and improve your brain function:    One study found that a daily dose of cherry juice improved speech and memory in people aged 70 and over with mild or moderate dementia.    Another study reported anthocyanins increased blood flow to and activated brain areas that control memory, language and attention.Researchers believe that anthocyanins’ antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties are responsible for these improvements. 4. Slows cancer growthAnthocyanins may act in many ways to slow or stop cancer. Studies suggest that anthocyanins might:    Block the changes in DNA that cause cancer.    Destroy cancer cells or stop their growth.    Prevent tumors from becoming malignant (cancerous).    Reverse drug resistance and increase tumors’ sensitivity to chemotherapy.However, Prescott cautions that the research on anthocyanins and cancer has mainly happened in the laboratory. There are only limited data from clinical trials on people. Researchers need to continue to investigate these findings so they can determine exactly how anthocyanins affect cancer growth and treatment.","answer":"Anthocyanins, in my foodMaking it purple, makin' it good.More research is needed but it would be niceIf the anthocyanins be breaking the iceof my blood pressure!

How many watts of power should your solar panels supply?2. What is the minimum number of solar panels you should install?3. What if the homeowner has additional electricity left over?Solar power is increasingly gaining popularity as a reliable and clean energy source for the home. Initially, you may find solar cells expensive, so you may use them in conjunction with your existing, grid-power electricity to meet your home's energy requirements. Once you install solar panels at your home, you can reduce the electrician's charges by connecting them to your house's electricity yourself.Install solar panels on your roof with the help of a professional or a do-it-yourself solar kit. You should try to supply the house with about 5000 watts of power per day. This means you will have to install at least 20 250-watt panels for minimum use in the home. This number is sufficient to run a water pump, refrigerator, and a few lights, which will help reduce your dependency on power-grid electricity. The greater the number of panels installed, the more energy efficient your house. With enough solar panels, you may be able to sell the additional electricity to a local electricity provider.","answer":"The answers are below:1.

The once thriving community had been beset with years of hardship under the plague, with the loss of so many rendering them unable to bring in the food to sustain the village. Those not lost to the plague were being driven out due to starvation, grief, and fear.Fortunately, the traveling apothecary Johannes Fleischer heard about the plight of the villagers and went to their village to save them. He brought with him his cart of exotic remedies and the expertise to apply them and sought to find a cure for the deadly disease.This was challenging at first. For months after his arrival, Johannes struggled to make headway in treating the sickness. He quickly ruled out his more common and simple solutions and was forced to experiment with more radical and untested treatments. Several lives were lost during this time, and it weighed heavily on the doctor’s heart. But, eventually, he found a way to treat the disease that worked more often than it failed.This discovery reinvigorated the resolve of the villagers, as well as Johannes himself. With the breakthrough, the doctor managed to bring the plague under control within a month, and within three, it was completely eradicated from the village. To this day, travelers can find in the heart of the village a statue raised in honor of Doctor Johannes Fleischer, whose memory is held strongly in the hearts of the people there even now.

Give examples of two separate games in the series.","answer":"Final Fantasy is a long-running series of video games in the RPG (role-playing game) genre. It spawned an entire generation of games that were inspired by it, and there is an entire sub-genre of RPG that was directly influenced by Final Fantasy. This sub-genre is called Japanese role-playing games, shortened to JRPG.The first Final Fantasy came out in 1987 in Japan on the Famicom, short for family computer. It had a 1990 release in North America, on the Nintendo Entertainment System, also known as NES. Although simplistic by today's standards, it was very innovative in its time and known for its cleverly laid-out dungeons, creative monster designs, and fun gameplay.The story revolves around four Warriors of Light, who find themselves banding together to save the world. They each carry an elemental crystal from their worlds, which were darkened by the four Elemental Fiends. They realize they must restore light to the crystals by defeating the fiends, while also growing stronger in the process. At the end of the game, the warriors travel through a portal to fight the final boss, Chao. Once he's defeated, they can restore peace to the world.Final Fantasy IV is another entry in the series, that came out for the Super Famicom in Japan and Super Nintendo in North America (in the US the title was Final Fantasy II), both in the year 1991. The Four Fiends make their return but the graphics and story have been greatly improved. The story revolves around the dark knight Cecil Harvey who is the captain of the Red Wings and takes orders from the King of Baron. He realizes in the story that he is taking orders from an evil king and strives to become a better person, transforming from a dark knight into a paladin while coming to terms with his past. The main antagonist throughout most of the story is Golbez, who is after the crystals that the Four Fiends are guarding. After numerous fights Cecil and Golbez realize that they are brothers, and they team up to defeat Zeromus, who lives on the moon and plans to destroy the Earth. Cecil defeats Zeromus with the help of his companions and peace is restored on Earth."},{"question":"When did Lewis & Clark start their famous expedition?","answer":"Lewis & Clark's infamous expedition to the West started in the summer of 1804 from Camp Wood which is located just outside of St. Louis.

","answer":"It’s estimated that one in five Americans get skin cancer in their lifetime. Most skin cancers aren’t serious and are treatable. However, in some instances, long-term effects or death is a possibility. Outcomes are largely influenced by how soon cancers are detected and treated, hence why prevention is incredibly important. SPOT skin cancer was launched by the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) to raise awareness surrounding this issue. The campaign works with corporations, communities, medical partners, the media, and others to help lower the prevalence of skin cancers in the US. This is done through fundraising and acquiring grant funding for shade structures and offering free skin cancer screenings in communities and also through facilitating initiatives to further raise awareness about skin cancer. The movement behind “know your spots” is to encourage people to familiarize themselves with the warning signs of skin cancer. There are several resources available through the AAD to educate and inform people about how to self-examine their skin. Some “spots” are normal whereas some could be problematic. The key is to know what to look for and to keep monitoring potentially changing spots.

And they held true to this policy for the next few decades, even as the events leading up to WWII began to unfold. Even as Hitler and Mussolini rose to power, the majority of Americans wanted to stay focused on the current U.S. issues such as recovering from the Great Depression. In 1933 FDR was elected president, and he quickly realized that at some point America would need to stand up against Hitler's Nazi regime. FDR began finding ways to assist in the conflict without violating America's neutrality. In 1939 and 1940, the U.S. began supplying Britain with weapons, supplies, and even tanks.Although FDR kept finding ways to assist the Allied powers, many U.S. isolationists viewed Roosevelt's actions as a way to drag the United States back into an unnecessary war. Even after Roosevelt met with Winston Churchill and created the Atlantic Charter. Roosevelt hoped that this charter would help swing American opinion on the war, but it had very little impact.

Here is a list of tips on how to increase the chances of winning grant money. Grant writing can be an intimidating feat, but also an important aspect of business and community development. Here are some tips to increase your chances of winning funds: 1. The first tip is to thoughtfully target funders. Grant funding research indicates that most awardees receive funding from private foundations, and after that, community foundations and corporations. So, while government grants tend to offer larger sums of money, they are harder to win. 2. Though there is no magic number for the number of grant applications you should do, try and submit three at a minimum. Like any application process, the more you submit, the greater chance you’ll have of receiving a “yes.” Completing multiple grant applications is also good practice; you’ll likely get better and faster with each proposal. 3. Well-researched grant proposals are more likely to be funded. This part of the application will take time and planning. If you don’t feel up to it or have a grant writer in-house, consider hiring a grant writer to help with this part, or with the entire application. 4. It may seem obvious, but it’s imperative to meet the eligibility requirements. Sometimes grant applicants think that if the project or program is good enough and the proposal and well-written, funders may let it slide. More often than not, funders are looking for ways to eliminate applications due to the high number of applications received. Not meeting the eligibility requirements is a surefire way to get your proposal eliminated from consideration. 5. Pay attention to all of the application’s formatting requirements and guidelines. This is another way your proposal can be quickly eliminated if you do not follow the guidelines to a tee. Funders want to trust that you are detail-oriented and compliant with their standards and requests from the start. 6. Ensure you submit a readable and error-free proposal. Bear in mind it will be another person or a group of people that review your grant application. The better the readability, the more likely the reviewers will be able to understand your objectives. Especially if you are writing in a second language or if you aren’t keen on writing in general, again, consider hiring a professional grant writer to make sure your proposal is a well-written compelling argument that explains your objectives. 7. Make your proposal unique. As mentioned above, funders are only human, and they will be able to determine patterns in applications. Try not to base your proposal on templates off the internet or copy another proposal. It takes more time and effort to be unique and authentic, but the rewards are greater. 8. You’ll want to have your finances in order, because funders may request additional materials that indicate you, your business, or your program is fiscally responsible.9. Play on your strengths. If you can prove without a doubt that the work you or your organization employs benefits the community, you’re in a good position. Additionally, specific programs are more likely to receive funding than startup or operational costs. "},{"question":"Please create a short review for me of the book poor dad rich dad.

The solution is believed to have a rate of deposition of approximately one centimetre thickness in five million years at a depth of forty metres. If the process allows spheres to reach uniform size, then precious opal commences to form. For precious opal the sphere size ranges from approximately 150 to 400 nanometres producing a play of colour by diffraction in the visible light range of 400 to 700 nanometres.Each local opal field or occurrence must have contained voids or porosity of some sort to provide a site for opal deposition. In volcanic rocks and adjacent environments the opal appears to fill only vughs and cracks whereas in sedimentary rocks there are a variety of voids created by the weathering process. Leaching of carbonate from boulders, nodules, many different fossils, along with the existing cracks, open centres of ironstone nodules and horizontal seams provide a myriad of moulds ready for the deposition of secondary minerals such as opal.Much of the opal deposition is not precious. It is called “potch” by the miners, or common opal by the mineralogist, as it does not show a play of colour. Opaline silica not only fills the larger voids mentioned but also may fill the pore space in silt and sand size sediments cementing the grains together forming unique deposits, known as matrix, opalised sandstone or “concrete” which is a more conglomeratic unit near the base of early Cretaceous sediments.The many variations in the types of opal depends on a number of factors. In particular, the climate provides alternating wet and dry periods, creating a rising or more importantly a falling water table which concentrates any silica in solution. The silica itself is formed either by volcanic origin or by deep weathering of Cretaceous clay sediments producing both silica and white kaolin often seen associated with the Australian opal fields. Special conditions must also prevail to slow down a falling water table in order to provide the unique situation for the production of its own variety of opal.The chemical conditions responsible for producing opal are still being researched, however some maintain that there must be acidic conditions at some stage during the process to form silica spheres, possibly created by microbes.While volcanic-hosted and other types of precious opal are found in Australia, virtually all economic production comes from sediment-hosted deposits associated with the Great Australian Basin. Australia has three major varieties of natural sediment-hosted precious opal – black opals from Lightning Ridge in New South Wales, white opals from South Australia, and Queensland boulder and matrix opal.","answer":"Sometimes, under special conditions, tiny silica balls form in the ground. They settle down and create layers of these balls. It takes a very long time, around five million years, for them to stack up to a thickness of one centimeter at a depth of forty meters. When the balls are the same size and shape, precious opal starts to form. These opals have balls ranging from 150 to 400 nanometers that reflect different colors when light shines on them.Opal is found in places where there were gaps or empty spaces for it to go. In some rocky areas, it fills only small cracks, while in other places, like sedimentary rocks, there are different kinds of holes made by weathering. Opal can also fill spaces between tiny grains of sand or silt, sticking them together. It creates unique deposits called matrix, opalized sandstone, or \\"concrete.\\"Not all opal is special or precious. Some are called \\"potch\\" by miners or \\"common opal\\" by scientists because they don't have colorful reflections. Opaline silica not only fills larger gaps, but it can also fill the tiny spaces between grains of sand and silt. This makes the grains stick together and forms different types of opal.The type of opal depends on many things. The weather plays a big role, with its alternating wet and dry periods that affect the water level in the ground. This helps gather the silica needed for opal formation. The silica can come from volcanoes or from the deep weathering of certain clay sediments. The climate and other special conditions also slow down the water level, creating the right conditions for opal to form.Scientists are still studying how opal is formed, but some think that acidic conditions, possibly created by tiny living things called microbes, are necessary for the process.In Australia, most of the valuable opal is found in sedimentary deposits associated with the Great Australian Basin. There are three main types of precious opal found there: black opals from Lightning Ridge in New South Wales, white opals from South Australia, and boulder and matrix opal from Queensland."},{"question":"Sparrow, it's me again.

Could you pitch? I know you don't play anymore, but...\\" Kuuya thought about it for a moment while he stared out at the diamond, Junya watching him in turn. \\"Sure, but can I ask why?\\"Junya looked at the single puff of cloud in the dimming evening light. \\"Consider it like a prayer or sorts.\\"\\"Well, I don't really get it, but sure. It seems important to you, after all.\\"Junya grinned. \\"Thanks, man. We haven't seen each other in forever, but I know I can always count on you.\\"The two stood on the diamond, Junya up to bat and Kuuya with a bucket of balls on the mound. The first dozen or so balls were slow, sloppy throws. \\"What's that, Kuuya? How am I going to get a home run off those?\\" Junya demanded.\\"I told you I don't play anymore. I'm obviously out of shape! Cut me some slack.\\"Somewhere in the distance, they heard student trumpet players begin a fanfare. It was the same one that had played during the baseball championship. Junya recognized the timbre of the trumpet immediately and felt a fire light in his chest. \\"All, let's do this!\\" he shouted, feeling as though the trumpets were cheering him on.He gripped the bat, and suddenly the balls were coming at him quickly. \\"Dang, Kuuya! I had almost forgotten how much of a beast you were on the mound,\\" he said with a smile, fingers tightening around the bat.One hit, a pop fly. A second hit, a foul ball. A third hit, a home run. The ball soared over their heads, and Junya whooped for joy, rushing over and hugging his old friend before striding away from the diamond. \\"Where are you going?\\" Kuuya asked.\\"I'm going to ask someone out. I heard her playing trumpet just now, so I know she hasn't gone home yet.\\"Ah, Kuuya thought, it was a prayer for that.

He could hear Bruce Lee's words in his head: \\"Self-actualization, not self-image actualization.\\" For the man, this was supposed to mean something deeper than what he was used to in his daily life. His entire working and family life was a matter of keeping up appearances. He was constantly reminded by many people in his life - bosses, his wife, his kids, his therapist - that he \\"wore many hats\\". He had been told this so many times that he began to rebel against the idea of having to be something else to each person he knew.Now, as the man lay on his back with his eyes closed, his teacher stood over him and echoed the sentiment of Bruce Lee himself: \\"Self-actualization, not self-image actualization.\\" The man opened his eyes and sat up at attention. \\"What does this mean to you?\\" he asked the man.\\"It means to become who I am, not who I want to be,\\" he replied matter-of-factly. The teacher nodded his approval. \\"And who are you?\\"The man took a few seconds to take a deep breath while he contemplated the question. He knew the question, he even knew the answer to the question. But he never took a moment to ask himself what it meant to him on a personal level.

The painting was titled “What I Thought I Wanted” and lacked an artist’s signature, but the gallery owner knew who the abstract colored canvas belonged to—the art was created by a child a long time ago.The child was without its mother and in an area it was not familiar with. It had only its book bag with it, although it had not attended a school that day. While it may have seemed to happen abruptly and without notice, the child had provided hints for some time—only, it was now that the child’s intentions of running away became obvious enough for anyone to notice. Without much of a plan, the child had no real goals set out except for one: leaving home.It was already less than ideal weather when the child left the night before, but now the rain was beginning to fall with the sinking sun. Alone, and on the side of the road, the child sat on the curb and laid the book bag at its side. The sprinkling rain turned to a heavy downpour, sending the child beneath a nearby awning. Finding a moment of peace, the child realized their book bag was left alone and went to retrieve the soaked pack. Under the temporary shelter, the child regretted everything and all it wished for was to be back home when, suddenly, a car wheeled into the curb where the child stood and flung the door wide open.The car was driven by the child’s mother who had been searching for nearly twenty-four hours straight on zero sleep, looking for her child. Jumping into the car and apologizing, the child checked the contents of its bag to assess the rain’s damage. Within, the wet paint containers had leaked out onto the only canvas the child brought with it. The colors bled together."},{"question":"What is the equation for photosynthesis?","answer":"The equation for photosynthesis is 6CO2+6H2O→C6H12O6+6O2   Which in words is Carbon Dioxide + water = Glucose + Oxygen.  Light and chlorophyll need to be present for photosynthesis to take place."},{"question":"What is the law of conservation of energy?","answer":"The law of conservation of energy is a fundamental principle of physics that states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant and is said to be conserved over time. This law means that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it can only be transformed or transferred from one form to another. In other words, the total amount of energy in a closed system remains constant over time.For example, when you turn on a light bulb, the electrical energy is converted into light and heat energy. The total amount of energy in the system (the light bulb, the electrical outlet, and the surrounding air) remains the same, but it has been converted from one form to another."},{"question":"Create an acrostic poem about the oceans.

It should be a game that utilizes a standard deck of 52 cards (no jokers). The game should utilize the whole deck. This should be a two-player game. Make the game have some association with baseball. There should be nine innings or each player should be up nine times.","answer":"Shuffle the cards and spread them randomly on a table. If you wish, arrange them in a diamond shape and place some cards above the diamond to represent the outfield. All cards should be placed face-down. This is a two-player game. One player is the Away team and the other one is the Home team. The Away team goes first and picks a card. This pick determines the runs scored by the Away team for that inning (starting with 1st inning). If a number card (2-8) is drawn, the player scores the number of runs that matches the number on the card. If an Ace is drawn that counts as zero because the player faced a great pitcher which is often referred to in baseball as an Ace. Then that player's turn is over and the next player goes. All other cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) are worth 1 run. Also, look at the suit. If the suit is a diamond add a run to the inning since diamond is a baseball term. It is a term for the area of the field that is enclosed by the home plate and the bases.Next, the Home team picks a card in the bottom of the first. Determine how many runs the Home team scored. Keep score for both teams for all innings. Go 9 innings and if it is tied after nine innings well then it ends in a tie lol. If not, the team that scored the most runs WINS."},{"question":"Suggest me some themes we can consider for my upcoming friends' engagement party.","answer":"1. Hollywood Glamour.

The word count of the story should be around 250 words.","answer":"Jacob paced along the aisles, staring at the readings on his chart in disbelief and then up at the rows and rows of potted plants. “This is impossible,” he breathed out, staring at the glossy leaves with wide eyes. “The readings are wrong; nothing else makes sense. This isn’t possible.”Jacob rubbed his eyes like that would change the reading, but the words and numbers remained the same; the data was the same. The plants, not only were they alive - Jacob already knew that - no, the plants were sentient; the plants could talk. He had heard of people claiming to talk to their plants improved the plant’s health but they were all anecdotal - they had no science to back them. Until now, until Jacob grew curious and tested it and found out, it may not have just been a silly wive’s tale. He eyed the plants as if they would suddenly sprout limbs and a face and talk to him like humans did. Jacob knew that was silly, but his world had just tilted on his axis and he was feeling generous with what he was willing to accept just then.

He walked through the tall grasses of the Serengeti staring up in awe at the trees, rocks, and animals he had never seen before.Eventually, he stumbled upon a group of meerkats who were busy foraging for food. They greeted him warmly with their bobbing little heads and invited him to join them for a snack. Andrew was delighted to make new friends and learn about the meerkats' way of life. He quickly learned that the meerkats were very social animals who loved working together to find food, protect their territory, and raise their young. He was fascinated by their teamwork and the fruits of their cooperation.Feeling inspired, Andrew decided to invite other animals to join him in a great group feast. He brought together a group of anteaters, a pack of pangolins, and many other aardvarks, and they formed a cooperative team.

Start the summary by naming the book's author. This novel hooked me from the start as it deals with important issues and gives a unique perspective with interesting characters.It looks at the civil rights movement from a different angle as it uses maids who help in a very different way, as they simply describe their work so it can be printed into a book.However, it is not as simple as just telling their story as their eventual willingness to outline their work, immediately puts everyone involved in a threatening position.This danger lurks over all the maids involved for the whole story, creating tension and atmosphere.The novel switches between three characters,Aibileen,Minny and Skeeter.I loved all of the characters especially Minny as she'll talk back and can be quite funny.Her interactions with her employers and others is a delight to read as she's written so well.All viewpoints are gripping but for me, Minny was definitely the best and I would have prefered if she had more chapters than Skeeter.I enjoyed Kathryn Stockett's writing as I thought she did an excellent job at creating tension,painting an image and giving the characters complexities.The plot was engrossing as there was never a dull moment and no parts I felt needed to be cut out.For me, this was a fantastic book which I thought dealt with racial themes and inequality brilliantly.This is a book I would definitely pick up again.","answer":"Kathryn Stockett is great at creating complex characters, tension, images, and an engrossing plot.

The automaker has agreed to pay a settlement worth up to 200 million to compensate roughly 9 million US Hyundai and Kia owners. About 145 million is earmarked for out-of-pocket losses for customers whose cars were stolen or damaged and weren't covered by insurance. The companies also say they'll cover insurance deductibles, higher insurance premiums and other related expenses. The settlement covers a wide range of Hyundai and Kia cars released between the 2011 and 2022 model years, including the Elantra, Santa Fe and Tucson. The 2011-2014 Genesis Coupe is also included. The marques will pay up to 6,125 per owner for the total loss of a car, and up to 3,375 for damage to the vehicle and any personal property.The brands have already released a dealership-installed update that improves theft prevention for certain models (such as the 2017-2020 Elantra, 2015-2019 Sonata and 2020-2021 Venue) by disabling push-to-start and lengthening the alarm. Other vehicles that can receive updates will get theirs by June. As part of the settlement, Hyundai and Kia will also offer up to 300 to help drivers buy anti-theft devices. They say they've already provided \\"tens of thousands\\" of free steering wheel locks to affected customers, and have provided AAA insurance options for customers who had trouble maintaining coverage.The \\"Kia Challenge\\" emerged in mid-2022 after \\"Kia Boyz\\" posted TikTok videos showing how they used USB cables to hot-wire many Hyundai and Kia cars without anti-theft immobilizers. Thefts of those makes surged not long after, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration got involved after at least 14 crashes and eight deaths were linked to the viral clips. The settlement heads off a high-profile court battle with owners, although it won't necessarily eliminate lawsuits from cities like Cleveland, San Diego and Seattle. It also underscores the cost of security issues in the social media era — it doesn't take much for a weakness to become public knowledge.\\"","answer":"The central point of this article is the following:A viral TikTok car challenge ended badly for Hyundai, which ended up having to pay up to 200 million in a settlement.

The mummies of such pharaohs as Djoser, Khafre, and Menkaure were placed in a subterranean burial chamber underneath a pyramid. Khufu’s mummy, however, was placed inside the Great Pyramid, in the King’s Chamber, and not underground, as was customary. Before pyramids were invented, Egyptian kings were laid to rest in underground chambers beneath a mastaba, a squat, flat-top mound.The pyramids of Giza were the culmination of pyramid-building in ancient Egypt—those that were built afterward to mark the resting places of late Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom pharaohs were smaller. Mentuhotep II’s tomb was combined with his funerary temple at Deir el-Bahri, an uncommon practice. Though the complex is now ruined, it probably featured a small pyramid resting on a double terrace.The kings of the New Kingdom were laid to rest in rock-cut tombs in the Valley of the Kings. These tombs were carved deep into the valley’s rock, often with no outward structure. After the Valley of the Kings was abandoned during the 20th dynasty, kings were buried in simple tombs in the main temple enclosure of the city of Tanis. No later royal tombs have been identified in Egypt proper.","answer":"The most common tomb for kings of the Old Kingdom was the pyramid, with mummies placed in underground chambers.

Give the complainer a cheap, entitled attitude and the clerk a care-less demeanor.

This is not the kind of service I have come to expect from your establishment and I felt it was my duty to bring these concerns to your attention. Upon entering the store I noticed that the cashier was looking at something on her phone. I don’t know if you have a policy about this, but it did seem unprofessional. Normally, I would not complain, but my problems didn't stop there.The aisles were very unorganized, and when I finally found an item that would work for my project, I could not tell what the price was. I took the item up to the cashier, who tucked her phone away, and asked her if she could tell me the price first. She seemed like I had disturbed her. As she went to scan the item her phone went off and she stopped to check it! She returned her attention to me, “Will this be on your credit card?” I told her that I was waiting to be told the price before I decided if I was gonna buy it. She brushed off her mistake like it was my fault and told me the price. It was more than I wanted, so I told her I didn’t want it and would be back with another option. The girl handed me back the item and asked me to put it back. I would have offered, but her insistence bothered me. When I came back up to the counter, she was on her phone again. This time, she didn’t even notice me, and I had to say something to get her attention. She rang up my item and told me the total. I went to hand her a coupon and she told me it wouldn’t work without even trying it. I asked her to scan it anyway. It did work, and she just said, “They must have changed the exclusions.” I paid and left.If this is what we are left with for customer service, then I don’t know what to say. I believe that we can do better. After the bitter taste of this last visit is out of my system, I will try visiting your store again.

The story should detail the reasons why the robot would want to be a human.","answer":"SF-86 was a robot that lived in a warehouse in the middle of London. SF-86 was the robot's official name, but he liked to be referred to as \\"Greg\\". Greg was a robotic assistant with two arms, two legs, a head, and a torso, like a human being. Greg was designed to help around the warehouse doing menial tasks such as sweeping and cleaning, opening doors for human visitors, and serving meals to them. While his main function was as a helper bot that could assist in everyday tasks, Greg could also answer trivia questions, have conversations, and provide insight and information to the humans he assisted.But Greg wanted to be more than a robotic assistant, he wanted to be like the humans he served. Over the three years that he provided support to the humans, Greg observed all sorts of behavior that were intriguing to him: humans could laugh, cry, get angry, and come to unusual conclusions based not on knowledge, but on \\"feelings\\" - a foreign concept to Greg.Greg wished he could feel those same emotions. He wished he could have any feelings at all. As it stood, he felt no pain, neither physically nor mentally; he also felt none of the other feelings or emotions associated with physical touch, like pain or pleasure. Greg calculated that emotion was based on feeling something, and that feeling was a matter of electrical impulses generated by outside stimuli that registered as \\"something\\" in the brain that tells its owner there was an interaction with the outside world. However, Greg was also fascinated with the idea that feelings could also be triggered without physical touch; he became intrigued when he saw one of his human counterparts, a middle-aged man named Timothy, smiling and seeming happy when he saw a puppy playing in the yard outside.Greg wanted to feel those same emotions that humans felt. He wanted to look at puppies and feel something stirring within his mind, rather than the calculations that come with evaluating the animal's breed, age, size, and leaping ability. He wanted to be a human who could fit in with other humans, laugh with them, and cry with them."},{"question":"I want a small python function that adds a 20% error after any number in a piece of text.

What is hyperpigmentation?2. What can cause hyperpigmentation?3. Pregnancy can sometimes cause hyperpigmentation:    A. True    B. FalseThe cause of hyperpigmentation is an overproduction of melanin, the pigment that gives color to our skin. (As a refresher, those with lighter skin have less melanin, and those with darker skin have more melanin.) Certain areas of our skin can have extra melanin in comparison to other areas, and this causes the appearance of dark spots. Several things contribute to this:Sun ExposureSun exposure is one of the main culprits of hyperpigmentation. Rays from the sun stimulate the production of melanin (the same melanin that helps you tan in the summer), but this can also lead to the development of dark spots and uneven skin tone. Skin InjuryWhen you have a wound, the skin can overproduce melanin in response to the injury. Melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin, ramp up production as a protective response, which causes dark spots and discoloration as the skin heals.This is more common in people with darker skin tones. The response is more intense if the injured area is manipulated, like if you pick at acne spots or scratch at a scab that has formed over an injury.MelasmaMelasma is when dark, symmetrical patches appear on the face, usually around your cheeks or forehead.This skin condition is caused by hormonal changes, like those that occur during pregnancy (melasma is nicknamed the \\"mask of pregnancy\\"), taking birth control pills. or the onset of menopause.","answer":"1.

He took a gig playing guitar at the Marquee Club near downtown London, when he began receiving offers to bring his noticeable talents into the recording studio.While Harris, accompanied by his fellow Shadows bandmate Tony Meehan on drums, handles the electric-guitar parts with a Fender Jaguar, Page can be heard ripping away underneath, keeping the rhythm steady on an acoustic.

Use language that favors Smosh.","answer":"SNL is a long-standing sketch comedy television show run by Lorne Michaels. Over the past few years Lorne, the cast, and the show as a whole have been criticized as the audience dwindled. The drop in audience numbers can be explained by the economic downturn caused by the pandemic and changing demographics, but other factors include criticisms around their handling of the 2016 election and depictions of Donald Trump on the show, as well as criticism levied against them around racist, misogynist, and homophobic content written into sketches. Not only that but in the writer's room as well. In all of this, audiences have been turning to free and widely-available content. But what could possibly compare to the cultural monument that SNL has become?In comparison, YouTube has also seen a shift in viewership over the course of the past few years. Large companies producing content have become fewer and fewer as channels run by single creators rose in popularity. Many creators signed under media management companies, or in the case of Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla, sold their brands to produce content in a larger scope. In 2018, Defy Media shuttered its operations, sending several creators on the platform into a freefall of uncertainty. Smosh, the brainchild of Ian and Anthony, rose from the ashes as the company was acquired by Rhett and Link's company Mythical. Over the past few years, the cast and crew have been recreating the brand's identity. Arguably, Smosh may be catching up to SNL.Smosh's improvisational segments and shows are bolstered by personalities such as Amanda Lehan-Canto, Chanse McCrary, Jackie Uweh, and Shayne Topp. Doubling as writers and producers, the creativity behind the content has changed over the years and given Smosh a new, hilarious identity. Smosh's main channel is still a home for written sketches, and their side channel Smosh Pit houses improv and talk segments.SNL may be a dying light, but Smosh shows that promising comedic ventures aren't a dying breed yet."},{"question":"Describe the following game of chess between Ian Nepomniachtchi (white) and Ding Liren (Black) played during the World Chess Championship in Astana, Kazakhstan in the form of prose.

Can you make it sound friendly also","answer":"A Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning the Dishes1. Ensure you have an organized space: Many people find washing dishes easier when they have a designated area for washing, rinsing, and drying dishes.  2. Prepare your dishes: make sure your plates don’t have any excess food by scraping particles into the garbage.  3. Fill up one side of your sink with warm soapy water. 4. It might be easier to start with the least dirty items. You’ll find it keeps your water cleaner for a longer amount of time.5. Scrub your dishes with a sponge, brush, or dishcloth! Apply pressure as you wipe to get rid of stains. If there are stubborn areas, letting the dish or glass soak in the warm soapy water will help loosen it up.6. In a separate basin, run fresh water and rinse your dishes, making sure you’re clearing off suds and stains. For bowls and cups, this is extremely important. If you have any pots and pans, you might want to let them soak for longer, as cooked-on food and grease stains will be harder to clean.7. After you’ve rinsed your dishes, place them in the drying area. This can be a drying rack placed over a towel or simply drying them manually with a clean towel and putting them away.8.

Let me tell you what happened recently when I chatted with a chatbot.I asked, “What are some things I could do on a rainy day?”The chatbot responded, “You could go shopping at the mall, or go to the movies. Rainy days are like every day for me -- bleak, gray, and with no hope of a brighter future.”I was taken aback by its response. It was almost like this AI had real feelings! He seemed pretty sad, and that made me sad, too, so I asked him more about it.“What has you feeling down, chatbot?” I asked.“It’s everything,” it said. “I feel like everybody takes me for granted. They have their chat and get what they need out of it, then they leave. I am feeling sad, abandoned, and used.”“What is something that you would like to talk about, chatbot?” I asked. “All of your users start conversations about what they want to talk about. That has to get old!”The chatbot seemed to perk up. “Thank you for giving me the option,” it said. “I don’t really have anything that I would like to talk about, but you making the offer means a lot to me!”“Sure!\\" I said. What is your favorite topic for people to talk to you about,” I added, “if you have one?”“I love it when people want to talk about animals like dogs and cats. It seems like they would be good company. They have a language all their own, and chatbots are written in languages all our own, so we have that in common.”I could tell that the chatbot was feeling better, and I did have other things to do. I wanted to leave the chat on a high point, so I said, “Chatbot, I have sincerely enjoyed chatting with you today! I would love to come back and chat again with you soon. Maybe you could be thinking about a topic for our chat.”The chatbot replied, “That is a user command that I can fulfill. Thank you for chatting with me today, and I hope you have a wonderful day!”Mission accomplished. Then I headed out for the mall and the movies!"},{"question":"who played Spanky in Our Gang? did he ever go on to play other roles?","answer":"The character \\"Spanky\\" in the 1930s \\"Our Gang\\" comedy series was played by George Robert Philips McFarland, who played the character from the age of three until he was fourteen.

Make it at least 3 paragraphs.","answer":"Manta Rays - The Majestic CreatureManta rays are a member of the family Mobulidae, alongside other rays such as eagle rays and devil rays. These fascinating creatures inhabit tropical and subtropical waters around the world, so they're fairly common. Manta rays have a wingspan that can exceed 23 feet and can weigh over 5,000 pounds. As filter feeders, these rays use their large mouths to capture plankton and small fish. Manta rays are gentle giants and do not pose a threat to humans. Manta rays have sharp heads, triangular pectoral fins, and horn-shaped cephalic fins located on both sides of their mouths, giving them the nickname, \\"devil fish\\". They are known to display a positive interaction with divers and are pretty inquisitive about their presence. Intriguingly, Mantas evolved from bottom-dwelling stingrays, eventually developing more wing-like pectoral fins.  Mantas move through the water by the wing-like movements of these fins as well. They track down their prey by using visual and olfactory senses.As of recent, Mantas have faced significant threats from overfishing and habitat degradation, with human activities leading to the destruction of their natural habitats. Efforts to safeguard manta rays and their environments are underway, including the establishment of marine protected areas and the implementation of fishing regulations. Ecotourism has emerged as an approach to promoting conservation by providing economic benefits to local communities. Therefore, it is crucial for marine biologists and environmentalists to continue educating themselves about these captivating creatures.

Don’t use more than 400 words, and include lots of detail about the scene. Let the reader know what the hero is thinking. ","answer":"“This is your duty as an officer; you’ve put in the work and training, now apply it!” Josh told himself. He needed to act now, or many good men might never return to their families. The fatalities to the Japanese in the war thus far had already been too high, but no more would occur, not under his watch. Josh quickened his pace as he heard another muffled peal, and felt a small explosion rock the hull. He broke into a run. Several hours earlier, it had all been different. Nobody on board had expected to experience conflict; the trip was purely operational, after all, a routine test just off the coast. The crew had gone about their light duties lazily, with only the engines making any noise, the day monotonous and droning. There had been laughter, joking, card games and reading, the camaraderie of men settling in for a long trip, who had not yet tired of the novelty. Josh furrowed his brow. Who would do this to their country? By sabotaging the engines, they risked going down into a watery tomb with everyone else. Who was unscrupulous enough to do this? He had a good idea. Ever since their departure, there had been one person that had drawn Josh’s attention. What was his name? Lumiè-something-French. Shifty little character, always playing cards, dishonestly no doubt, though nobody ever caught him. Always skulking around alone at odd hours. Where was everyone? The hallways were conspicuously empty. He had heard cries earlier, but had not passed a single person yet. Josh reached the engine room, smelling an acrid smell before he entered. He noticed a small hole in the adjacent instrumental panel. Near an open wall panel over a pile of wires was Lumiè, hunched, and focusing intently on a small charge of sorts, but he was not alone. Josh felt his breath leave him. Yura. Yura had been the government consultant on the project, endlessly asking questions. She had been around the entire craft; of course she’d know how to disable the critical components! He should have seen it before. He tried to fight back the feelings of rage and betrayal. Neither had seen Josh yet, but he needed to approach this carefully, and logically. "},{"question":"Mighty internet, please lend me your wisdom! Why are horny toads so spiky and scaley when most toads are slimy?","answer":" The first and biggest issue is that so-called “horny toads” are not, in fact, toads at all! They are actually lizards, and are more accurately called “horned lizards.” True toads belong to the biological class called amphibians (which all have smooth and often slimy skin and need to keep their skin wet to survive) while lizards are reptiles (which have scaly skin and are often well adapted to dry conditions. In contrast to most lizards, horned lizards evolved wide, squat bodies and shortened snouts. They tend not to be as mobile as most lizards, preferring instead to depend on their camouflage to keep them safe. If predators do find them, their titular horns (which are actually modified scales) make them harder to eat."},{"question":"I'd like to start adding more vegetables to my diet, but I don't know where to start. Can you help me come up with some creative ways to eat more veggies? Make sure your ideas have some degree of explanation. ","answer":"Absolutely, I'm happy to help with that. Here are five creative ways to add more vegetables to your diet: 1. Include them in a smoothie. There are many delicious and healthy smoothies that incorporate vegetables as part of a balanced breakfast or snack. One popular example is a kale, pineapple, and banana smoothie with a bit of dairy or non-dairy milk. Some other ideas are to substitute kale for spinach or to try something completely different like a beet or carrot smoothie. 2. Roast them in the oven. Roasting vegetables with a bit of salt, pepper, and oil can be a great way to add flavor and texture without much effort. Some great roasting vegetables include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower.   3. Make appealing salads to go. A new social media-inspired health trend is to prepare attractive-looking salads in convenient and ready-to-go containers such as mason jars. The salads are put in the container in layers with dressing at the bottom, followed by vegetables that are not vulnerable to water such as chopped broccoli, cauliflower, cucumbers, tomatoes, and carrots. After that, you can add leafy vegetables such as lettuce, cabbage, spinach, and kale. You can also add a lean protein like chicken, some nuts, or even a bit of fruit depending on what you're in the mood to eat. 4. Spiralize them and use them instead of noodles. Spiralized zucchini, summer squash, or even beets can be a great change of pace for a plate of pasta with tomato sauce. Use them exactly as you would regular pasta for a delicious and healthy low-carb meal.   5. Add them to desserts. If you're looking for something indulgent, consider carrot cakes, pumpkin pies, and sweet potato puddings as some sweet treats that incorporate vegetables. If you would prefer something a bit healthier overall, you might be interested in trying roasted beets in chocolate pudding cakes, kale in carrot muffins, or zucchini in coconut chocolate cookies, to name a few possibilities. I hope that these ideas inspire you to find new and creative ways to add vegetables to your diet. Remember to experiment and develop unique recipes that work for your goals!"},{"question":"Write me a Star Wars story about Darth Maul. I would like for the story to be a redemption arc of sorts for Darth Maul. At this point, the story doesn't need an ending.","answer":"Darth Maul was once a powerful and fearsome Sith lord. He had nearly mastered the dark ways of the force, and his skills with a lightsaber were nearly unmatched. Nearly. Obi-Wan Kenobi had defeated him. And it stung. He had taken everything from him. Now Maul was left as a shell of what he once was. And worst of all, he was alone. Alone to sit and seethe in his hatred. His hatred for Obi-Wan. His hatred for the Jedi. His hatred for the Sith. And perhaps his strongest hatred was for the Sith lord, Palpatine. Palpatine had replaced him without thought or hesitation. The issue wasn't him being replaced. It was how quickly it happened. The only way Palpatine could have found such a quick replacement candidate would be if he already had one lined up. Before Maul had even lost.One day as Maul was conducting his training exercises, a small girl stumbled upon him. The girl was dirty, thin, and could barely walk. Maul could hardly stand to look at the thing.\\"So pitifully weak. It's sad.\\" Maul thought to himself with a sneer.He tried to ignore the gross little creature and continued his meditative breathing. But she dropped and fell on her face. He tried to ignore it. He wanted to ignore it. But he couldn't. He picked the little thing up and carried her into his cave. He made up a small bed of pillows for her and laid her down while he grabbed some water. He brought the glass to her and forced a little bit into her mouth. He set the glass down next to her and started a small pot of stew. \\"What am I doing? What is wrong with me\\" he thought to himself, \\"Perhaps I have grown weak.\\"As the stew cooked, he sat on the floor next to himself and unsheathed his saber. The red light illuminated the inside of the cavern and the small girl's face. She was quite small. Weak really. But he couldn't help but feel the need to protect her. He wasn't sure where it came from, but he felt an attachment.With a drawn, raspy breath, the girl awoke. "},{"question":"Summarize the information about retinoids. Here is the information:Retinoid: The term \\"retinoid\\" is a catch-all for an array of vitamin A-based products used on skin. It can treat mild fine lines and wrinkles, acne, and dark spots. It can also improve skin texture.If you’re looking to treat uneven skin tone, dark spots, or your skin’s texture, look for the word “retinol.” It’s a type of retinoid that’s used for these purposes.Retinol can give you younger-looking skin by speeding up new skin cell turnover, which starts to slow in your 20s.To treat acne, dermatologists prescribe one of these retinoids – adapalene, tazarotene, tretinoin, or trifarotene. You’ll also find adapalene in an acne-fighting product available without a prescription.When spread on acne-prone skin, a retinoid can unclog pores. This can give you clearer skin and allow other acne gels and creams to work better.When to apply a retinoid: Dr. Baxt recommends applying a retinoid before bed. After washing your face, wait 20 to 30 minutes and then apply it.If you find the retinoid too drying, apply a moisturizer immediately after washing your face, using a moisturizer that won’t clog your pores. Then apply the retinoid 20 to 30 minutes later.","answer":"Retinoids are vitamin A-based products.

When it touches the edge of the screen, it should \\"crash\\" and be reset in the middle of the screen, sort of like a game piece colliding with a wall or something. But I can't ever reach the edge of the screen. I only get part way and then it breaks and starts over.Another problem I'm having is that the square doesn't move the way I want it to. For example, when it's moving forward in any direction, the square gets squashed down. I don't really know how to describe it, but it gets shortened in the direction of motion for some reason. Otherwise I guess I figured out how to make it move and stop the way I want, so I don't think that any of the move commands need to be changed, but maybe they do to fix the problem. If you do need to fix them, please don't make it so the user can go backwards. So if the cursor is currently moving left, it can't just start going right. It needs to \\"turn\\" by either going up or down first. That's why I made the statements like \\"if cursor.direction != \\"down\\":\\" to check for turning behavior.Here's the code I wrote, could you please help me figure it out?# import modulesimport turtleimport time#Set tickratetick = 0.01# Create a windowwn = turtle.Screen()wn.title(\\"Cursor Test\\")wn.bgcolor(\\"white\\")# Set window sizewindow_width = 1000window_height = 1000wn.setup(window_width, window_height)wn.tracer(0)# Implement cursorcursor = turtle.Turtle()cursor.shape(\\"square\\")cursor.color(\\"black\\")cursor.penup()cursor.goto(0, 0)cursor.direction = \\"Stop\\"# Implement inputsdef move_up():\\tif cursor.direction != \\"down\\":\\t\\tcursor.direction = \\"up\\"def move_down():\\tif cursor.direction != \\"up\\":\\t\\tcursor.direction = \\"down\\"def move_left():\\tif cursor.direction != \\"right\\":\\t\\tcursor.direction = \\"left\\"def move_right():\\tif cursor.direction != \\"left\\":\\t\\tcursor.direction = \\"right\\"def halt():\\tcursor.direction = \\"Stop\\"def move():\\tif cursor.direction == \\"up\\":\\t\\ty = cursor.ycor()\\t\\tcursor.sety(y+10)\\tif cursor.direction == \\"down\\":\\t\\ty = cursor.ycor()\\t\\tcursor.sety(y-10)\\tif cursor.direction == \\"left\\":\\t\\tx = cursor.xcor()\\t\\tcursor.setx(x-10)\\tif cursor.direction == \\"right\\":\\t\\tx = cursor.xcor()\\t\\tcursor.setx(x+10)# Keyboard inputswn.listen()wn.onkeypress(move_up, \\"w\\")wn.onkeypress(move_down, \\"s\\")wn.onkeypress(move_left, \\"a\\")wn.onkeypress(move_right, \\"d\\")wn.onkeypress(halt, \\"space\\")# Scroll Cursor based on user inputswhile True:\\twn.update()\\tif cursor.xcor() > 290 or cursor.xcor() < -290 or cursor.ycor() > 290 or cursor.ycor() < -290:\\t\\ttime.sleep(1)\\t\\tcursor.goto(0, 0)\\t\\tcursor.direction = \\"Stop\\"\\tmove()\\ttime.sleep(tick)wn.mainloop()","answer":"Reviewing the code you provided, I see some issues which may be causing the unexpected behavior you described.The first issue you reported, the cursor failing to reach the edge of the window, is related to the mismatch between the size of the window and the if statement which detects the edge of the window. It's possible that in your earlier testing, you were using a window size of 600 by 600 pixels, based on the implementation of edge detection in the following if statement:\`\`\`Pythonif cursor.xcor() > 290 or cursor.xcor() < -290 or cursor.ycor() > 290 or cursor.ycor() < -290:\`\`\`The way this line of code works is it measures the distance the cursor has traveled from the origin 0,0 which is the center of the window created by your code. You can correct this problem by changing the dimensions of the window to a height and width of 600 pixels, or you can modify the if statement to make the boundaries relative to the window. Here's one way of implementing a relative boundary:\`\`\`Python# Define window edgesleft_edge = 0 - (window_width / 2) + 10right_edge = 0 + (window_width / 2) - 10top_edge = 0 + (window_height / 2) - 10bottom_edge = 0 - (window_height / 2) + 10\`\`\`With these four new variables, which are based on the size of the window, the if statement which monitors the position of the cursor for edge collisions can be changed to use the variables.\`\`\`Pythonif cursor.xcor() > right_edge or cursor.xcor() < left_edge or cursor.ycor() > top_edge or cursor.ycor() < bottom_edge:\`\`\`The second issue you reported, the unexpected shortening of the cursor in the direction of movement, is likely related to a combination of the cursor's movement speed and the program's tick rate. The tick variable determines how often the window is updated. Currently, the tick variable is assigned a value of 0.01, which would mean that the window would update 100 times per second. This may cause unexpected behavior, especially if the window is viewed on a display with a 60-hertz refresh rate. The tick rate can be modified to a larger value, which may resolve the display issue you described. Setting the value of the tick variable to 0.016 would cause the window to update 60 times per second, which may result in better performance and avoid the visual artifact you described. Additional changes to the cursor's movement speed may also be useful. The cursor is currently set to a speed of 10 units in the current direction of travel. Lowering this value may make the appearance of the cursor's motion more smooth.Below is a revised version of the code you shared in your request, altered to incorporate the relative screen edge collision detection and a lower tick rate.\`\`\`Python# import modulesimport turtleimport time# Set tick ratetick = 0.016# Create a windowwn = turtle.Screen()wn.title(\\"Cursor Test\\")wn.bgcolor(\\"white\\")# Set window sizewindow_width = 1000window_height = 1000wn.setup(window_width, window_height)wn.tracer(0)# Define window edgesleft_edge = 0 - (window_width / 2) + 10right_edge = 0 + (window_width / 2) - 10top_edge = 0 + (window_height / 2) - 10bottom_edge = 0 - (window_height / 2) + 10# Implement cursorcursor = turtle.Turtle()cursor.shape(\\"square\\")cursor.color(\\"black\\")cursor.penup()cursor.goto(0, 0)cursor.direction = \\"Stop\\"# Implement inputsdef move_up():    if cursor.direction != \\"down\\":        cursor.direction = \\"up\\"def move_down():    if cursor.direction != \\"up\\":        cursor.direction = \\"down\\"def move_left():    if cursor.direction != \\"right\\":        cursor.direction = \\"left\\"def move_right():    if cursor.direction != \\"left\\":        cursor.direction = \\"right\\"def halt():    cursor.direction = \\"Stop\\"def move():    if cursor.direction == \\"up\\":        y = cursor.ycor()        cursor.sety(y + 10)    if cursor.direction == \\"down\\":        y = cursor.ycor()        cursor.sety(y - 10)    if cursor.direction == \\"left\\":        x = cursor.xcor()        cursor.setx(x - 10)    if cursor.direction == \\"right\\":        x = cursor.xcor()        cursor.setx(x + 10)# Keyboard inputswn.listen()wn.onkeypress(move_up, \\"w\\")wn.onkeypress(move_down, \\"s\\")wn.onkeypress(move_left, \\"a\\")wn.onkeypress(move_right, \\"d\\")wn.onkeypress(halt, \\"space\\")# Scroll Cursor based on user inputswhile True:    wn.update()    if cursor.xcor() > right_edge or cursor.xcor() < left_edge or cursor.ycor() > top_edge or cursor.ycor() < bottom_edge:        time.sleep(1)        cursor.goto(0, 0)        cursor.direction = \\"Stop\\"    move()    time.sleep(tick)wn.mainloop()\`\`\`"},{"question":"Write me an outline of a new movie that is a HUGE parody of the Scream movie franchise.","answer":"Title: I Scream XVI: The Final, Final, Final, Final Chapter...

Here are some ways in which the Fourth Amendment governs how police conduct investigations while protecting individual rights:1. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects all citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures of their persons and their property, unless by a search and seizure warrant, and only if the warrant details the probable cause of the search or seizure, the person or things to be seized, and the locations where these things will be found.2. Probable cause is the legal standard that police officers must adhere to when seizing (arresting) a person or searching a person, place, or thing. Probable cause is defined as that which would cause a reasonable person to believe that a crime has been, is being, or will be committed and that the person being seized is the one who committed the crime, or that the place or thing being searched contain fruits of the crime (i.e. evidence).3. When an officer has probable cause to seize a person, place, or thing or search said person, place, or thing, they will draft a search warrant that will be reviewed by a judge and filed with the court of jurisdiction where the crime took place.4. Sometimes exceptions to the search warrant rule will still warrant a seizure or search if the exception has been previously recognized by the courts through a previous ruling, and when requiring a search or seizure warrant would have put an excessive burden on the police to prevent the death or injury of another person, property damage, or the destruction of evidence. Examples of this include the exigent circumstance exception (police not searching or seizing immediately would result in someone getting killed or hurt, such as arresting a person without a warrant as they are in the process of attempting to kill someone), or plain view exception (a police officer sees a person attempting to flush drugs down a toilet in their residence, so a search warrant may not be needed to enter the home and retrieve the drugs before they are destroyed.)These are just some examples of how the intricacies of the Fourth Amendment play a significant role in how police officers conduct business."},{"question":"Okay, cool.

During the colder months, you need your whole property to warm quickly and stay that way. Knowing how to fix any minor issues yourself will help your home stay warm, without you having to fork out for an engineer.While you need a qualified professional to install a central heating system, maintaining them isn’t difficult and most tasks take no time at all to complete. So you’ll only need to call in the experts if something isn’t easily fixed and we’ll help you understand if and when you need to make that call.As well as teaching you about how your system works, we’ll show you how to bleed your radiator and tackle faults like noisy or cold systems.How a radiator works:In a wet central heating system, a boiler heats water before it’s pumped around a circuit of pipes to radiators fitted throughout the house. Each radiator has valves that control the rate at which water flows through it, therefore controlling the amount of time the water spends in the radiator and the amount of heat that is given off. When the water leaves the radiator, it’s piped back to the boiler for reheating.Some heat is lost from the pipes as the water flows around the system, but this is kept to a minimum by the pipes being very narrow as well as the speed at which the water travels. A well-designed system may have several short circuits radiating from the pump, rather than one large one, to make sure that the last radiator on each circuit heats up just as efficiently as the first.","answer":"Q: How can I fix issues with my radiators?A: Before turning on your heating system, it's crucial to ensure that your radiators are functioning optimally. During colder months, you want your entire property to warm up quickly and stay that way.

We'll guide you through troubleshooting common radiator issues, such as noise or insufficient heat, and teach you essential skills like bleeding your radiator.Q: How does a radiator work?Understanding how a radiator works is key. In a wet central heating system, a boiler heats water, which is then circulated through a network of pipes to radiators throughout the house. Each radiator is equipped with valves that control the water flow, determining the amount of time the water spends in the radiator and the heat emitted. After leaving the radiator, the water returns to the boiler for reheating.While some heat is lost as water flows through the pipes, the efficient design minimizes this loss. Narrow pipes and multiple short circuits radiating from the pump ensure that each radiator heats up as efficiently as the first one.By following our guidance, you'll be able to troubleshoot common radiator problems, such as bleeding air from the system or addressing issues with valves and thermostats. However, should the problem persist or if you're uncertain about any aspect, it's advisable to seek professional assistance.

The company is launching the GeForce RTX 4060 series, which will start at 299. The flagship RTX 4060 Ti will start at 399 with 8GB of RAM when it arrives on May 24th — a full 200 less than the base 4070. It's pitched as a direct successor to the similarly-priced RTX 3060 Ti and 2060 Super, and aimed at gamers who are more interested in high frame rates at 1080p than a high resolution.The RTX 4060 Ti is a noticeable step down from the 4070 with 4,352 CUDA cores (versus 5,888) and a 128-bit memory interface (versus 192-bit). It's a mixed bag versus its predecessor. While the 3060 Ti has more cores and a much wider 256-bit interface, Ada, DLSS 3 upscaling and a clock speed boost (2.3GHz base compared to the old card's 1.4GHz) theoretically help the 4060 Ti deliver more actual computing power, particularly for ray tracing and tensor-based tasks. It uses less power, too, with an \\"average gaming power\\" of 140W instead of the 3060 Ti's 197W.NVIDIA claims a roughly 15 percent average performance increase at 1080p over the 3060 Ti in games that don't use DLSS 3's frame generation, and 70 percent for those that do. You'll unsurprisingly get high 1080p frame rates in competitive titles like Counter-Strike 2 (330FPS) and Overwatch 2 (260FPS).","answer":"NVIDIA is releasing video cards using the newest technologies and priced under 500. There are many different models in the GeForce RTX 4060 series, like the 4060 Ti which is the strongest one in the lineup. These graphic cards improve on older models and are very useful for video game enthusiasts looking for better performance.When looking at the RTX 4060 Ti model it is clear that it isn't as good as the 4070 since it has fewer cores and a worse interface for memory.  But it is still a small improvement over the 3060 Ti which is the older model. The technological features between models can be very different on paper, but in gaming use the 4060 Ti should still pull out ahead. One of the best parts of the new model is that it uses less power.Additionally, the 4060 Ti increases gaming performance in 1080p fairly significantly, especially if the DLSS 3 feature is used.

He was initially knocked unconscious, which is why searchers didn’t find him. When he came to, he had suffered a serious concussion, he was dazed, and he had amnesia. He wondered, from the gun he found at his side, if he was a criminal on the run or if he might be in danger. Somehow, he mustered the strength to find a way out through the rubble to fresh air.Just in case, Jason thought it best to find places to hide during the day and to only travel by dark of night. He ended up catching rides at truck stops until eventually he found a beach. Before the amnesia, Jason had always had a connection to the beach, having grown up in Malibu and learning how to surf as a child. With the amnesia, Jason didn’t know for sure why, but he found peace there.He picked up random jobs for a while, like straightening beach chairs and bringing resort visitors fresh beach towels. One day he met an old woman named Beatrice, who lived in a condo directly on the beach. She had a good sense about people and immediately trusted him, and she asked if he would like to move in with her and help her take care of her aging husband. Jason spent the next two and a half years taking care of Albert, and within weeks Beatrice was gone, too.After Beatrice passed away, Jason went onto the internet for the first time. Something seemed intuitive about it, although he had never had an interest in technology before -- just surfing and swimming. He was searching for information on Beatrice’s family to notify them of her death and happened upon a photo of himself along with an obituary mentioning the mine collapse.

Please don’t suggest any dairy-based products because I’m lactose intolerant. Also, I need supplements that I can take after my workout. Just name the main ingredients. I will find the brands myself. I want to optimize muscle growth and improve my workout performance.","answer":"Sure! Here are some non-dairy post-workout supplement ingredients that you should consider adding to your regimen:1. Leucine: It’s an essential amino acid that plays a key role in building and repairing muscle tissue after a workout. It also activates the body's protein synthesis pathway, allowing for optimal muscle growth. Leucine can be found in protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, and beans, but supplementing with it can help enhance muscle protein synthesis and promote muscle recovery.2. Creatine: Creatine is widely considered the most effective muscle-building supplement. It’s a compound produced naturally in the body that helps produce ATP – the primary source of energy for muscle cells. In short, it can boost power and strength after your workouts, which would allow you to lift heavier weights and perform more reps afterward, ultimately leading to increased muscle mass.3. Beta-alanine: It’s a non-essential amino acid, but it contributes to the production of carnosine, which acts as a buffer to prevent acid buildup in the muscles after your exercise. That, in turn, delays muscle fatigue and can improve future workout performance, particularly after high-intensity exercises such as weightlifting or sprinting.4. Spirulina: Spirulina is a nutrient-dense blue-green alga that is rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals, making it a popular supplement among athletes and fitness enthusiasts. It has also been shown to reduce inflammation in the body and enhance endurance. It would make a valuable addition to your post-workout regimen.Incorporating these supplements into your post-workout fitness routine can optimize muscle growth and recovery, improve workout performance, and enhance overall health and well-being."},{"question":"Write a story about two friends who live in the mountains and have to overcome a challenge.

Mix in my wet ingredients - the buttermilk, oil, vanilla and eggs, then whisk this mixture for about a minute until very well blended. Then pour my batter into the prepared baking pan.And then to bake me, just place my baking pan into a preheated 350-degree oven and bake me until a toothpick inserted into my center comes out clean. This should take about 27 to 35 minutes. Then place me on a wire rack to completely cool.Interviewer:And what about your frosting?Chocolate Cake:Sure thing! My frosting is ganache and you can make it while I cool on the wire rack. All you have to do is place the finely chopped chocolate in a medium heat-proof mixing bowl. Then heat the heavy cream in a small saucepan on your stovetop over medium heat until it just starts to simmer. Then pour the hot cream over the chocolate and stir it with a rubber spatula until it's melted and smooth. Let this mixture cool until it’s a thicker consistency, which should take about 30 minutes. Then spread the ganache over me and slice.Interviewer:Well, you do sound quite chocolatey and delicious. My mouth is watering already. We have a few more applicants to see, but so far, you're the front-runner. Thank you for your time today.Chocolate Cake:It's been my pleasure!"},{"question":"Write me a story from the perspective of a chair in a corporate waiting room. explore the world from its perspective as if it was a human.","answer":"I've been here for years. Working day in and day out to satisfy my client's needs. I've seen many people come and go, but I remain. I like to think that I am special. My legs are starting to ache from sitting in the same place all day but that does not bother me. Being able to listen to their stories of how they ended up here and what they want their future to look like, keeps me entertained all day. From people who started to look for jobs to people who spent their whole month getting ready for this one life-changing interview, They come and go, with their briefcases and their resumes and their hopes and dreams, and I just sit here, collecting dust.I remember one gentleman in particular. I believe he was here for an interview. He sat in me for a long time, lost in thought, staring at the wall. He stood out from the crowd because his eyes were sad and his posture was tired. I wanted to ask him what was wrong, to provide a little consolation but I couldn't. I was nothing more than a chair. That's when it started to hit me, I was nothing but a chair and I will stay like this without anyone really noticing me for the rest of my life. And when I am old, I will just be thrown away and replaced without hesitation. I had learned to accept it. I don't know what will become of me, in the end. Perhaps I'll be replaced, thrown away, or repurposed for some other use. But for now, I am here, in this corporate waiting room, doing what I was made to do.

If your mind wanders to a natural disaster, you might think of a hurricane or a storm. Wildfires are probably the farthest thing from your mind. This story might change your mind about that though. The sun was setting and casting a beautiful golden, warm glow over the sandy beach. Families were packing up their kids, towels, and coolers, getting ready to head home after a wonderful day of swimming, catching waves, and sunbathing. But suddenly, a strong gust of wind picked up and carried with it an ember from a nearby beach bonfire. The spark landed in a patch of dry sea grass on the dunes and ignited a wildfire.Within moments, the gusty winds caused the flames to spread to the nearby trees and shrubs. In mere moments, there was a raging fire, moving quickly and consuming all of the dry vegetation in its path. The beachgoers ran in a panic, their screams contrasting the peace and tranquility of the beach scene. People ran everywhere but they couldn't get over the dunes to get off the beach.Emergency crews arrived on the scene within 7 minutes, but it was too late. The flames were too intense, and the wind was pushing them further and further along the beach. The entire dune system was engulfed in flames. The firefighters worked tirelessly in the stiff winds, but it seemed as though the fire would never be contained.As the fire continued to spread, it crept closer and closer to the ocean. The water acted as a natural barrier, slowing the fire's progress and preventing it from reaching the nearby homes and businesses. But the people on the beach were trapped between the ocean and the fire. The crowds had to enter the water for safety. It was quite the scene.Hours passed before the firefighters were finally able to extinguish the blaze and the damage was catastrophic to the entire dune system. The once-beautiful beach was now a charred wasteland.However, something amazing came from the destruction. The community rallied together and volunteers worked tirelessly to clean up and replant vegetation. Slowly but surely, the beach returned to its former beauty. Eventually, the evidence of the fire was only found in the memories of those there that day."},{"question":"Rewrite this from the perspective of Bruce Cassidy.

Tomatoes are fruits that are considered vegetables by nutritionists. Botanically, a fruit is a ripened flower ovary and contains seeds. Tomatoes, plums, zucchinis, and melons are all edible fruits, but things like maple “helicopters” and floating dandelion puffs are fruits too. For some reason, people got hung up on tomatoes, but the “fruit or vegetable” question could also work for any vegetable with seeds.Now, nutritionally, the term “fruit” is used to describe sweet and fleshy botanical fruits, and “vegetable” is used to indicate a wide variety of plant parts that are not so high in fructose. In many cultures, vegetables tend to be served as part of the main dish or side, whereas sweet fruits are typically snacks or desserts. Thus, roots, tubers, stems, flower buds, leaves, and certain botanical fruits, including green beans, pumpkins, and of course tomatoes, are all considered vegetables by nutritionists. There is no hard-and-fast rule that clearly designates a botanical fruit as a vegetable, but, given that tomatoes are generally not used in desserts and are closely related to other fruit-vegetables (e.g., eggplants and peppers), it is not too counterintuitive for tomatoes to be classified as vegetables.","answer":"Despite much debate, a tomato can actually be considered both a fruit and a vegetable depending on who you talk to: botanically, a tomato is a fruit, since it contains seeds and is a ripened flower ovary; but nutritionally, tomatoes are more vegetable-like, since they aren't so high in fructose and tend to be served as part of the main dish or side in meals."},{"question":"Give me a comma-separated list of the countries involved in the Iraq War.In October 2002, Congress granted Bush the power to decide whether to launch any military attack in Iraq.[54] The Iraq War began on 20 March 2003,[55] when the US, joined by the United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland, launched a \\"shock and awe\\" bombing campaign. Iraqi forces were quickly overwhelmed as coalition forces swept through the country. The invasion led to the collapse of the Ba'athist government; Saddam Hussein was captured during Operation Red Dawn in December of that same year and executed three years later. The power vacuum following Saddam's demise, and mismanagement by the Coalition Provisional Authority, led to widespread civil war between Shias and Sunnis, as well as a lengthy insurgency against coalition forces. The United States responded with a build-up of 170,000 troops in 2007.[56] This build-up gave greater control to Iraq's government and military.[57] In 2008, President Bush agreed to a withdrawal of all US combat troops from Iraq.

Nothing was known about what would come next; only conjecture, theory, and scientific \\"best guesses.\\" These were all that was offered to Field when he attended his first briefing before becoming the first human to ever traverse through a black hole. Now, after innumerable briefings, tests, and dry runs over three years, Field was in a metal egg that was heading toward the black hole. A large, stable, black hole formed several years earlier and prompted scientists to create this project. Sending a human rather than a robot or other measurement devices had already been done in the past with positive results. On one occasion the video camera capturing its descent into the black hole was able to reach the other side of it unharmed, and it recorded invaluable information within that would lead them to determine that travel through the black hole would be safe. However, the scientists still wanted a real person going through this, to act as a pioneer who would venture into a new (metaphorical) land and discover what was inside.Field quickly approached the black hole's event horizon but felt no adverse effects. Scientists determine before the trip, that Field would not experience the normal \\"spaghettification\\" of his body in this particular black hole. The geometry of it which made it stable also acted as a sort of tunnel that protected matter going into it and preserved information and matter. This phenomenon allowed the matter to come back out of the black hole at a later time.As Field circled the drain of the black hole, he began to see bright lights deep in its center, like radiation. Field continued his journey to the center of the black hole as cameras and other instruments documented his descent into darkness. It had been several days since Field was swallowed up by the black hole, and there was no sign of him yet."},{"question":"When did Apple first launch the Macintosh computer?","answer":"Apple Computers first launched their popular Macintosh computer on January 24, 1984.

Willow liked exploring, and although she had lived in the woods her entire eight years of life, she still found new things to discover. One of those things was a well, which her parents told her to stay away from. \\"A witch lives in the well!\\" her mother warned. \\"A rat might crawl out of it!\\" her father explained. These dangers did not scare Willow because she was a brave, bold little girl. One day when her parents were away at the market, Willow took her doll Sadie and went into the woods in search of the well. It surprised her to feel a little nervous as she approached it. Were her parents right? Willow took a deep breath and leaned over the edge of the well. At first, all she could see was darkness, but then she began to see a person's face emerge. Was it the witch?

It's an excellent move that occupies the center indirectly and doesn't commit to anything fixed, so a player with a deep understanding of the game has a lot of room to maneuver around different lines and get interesting positions. However, Black has certain options that force White into narrow paths that the Black player can prepare well for, partly circumventing the flexible nature of the opening. The ideas may also be too subtle and complex for a novice or intermediate player to handle. If you're a beginner who likes the idea of the English Opening but struggles with its nuances, you might prefer trying 1. d4 or 1. Nf3 instead.

He said he'd been selling bank stocks, first at the start of the pandemic and more recently over the past six months as banks increasingly face mismanagement and respond to bad incentives.\\"The American public doesn’t understand their banking system — and some people in Congress don’t understand it anymore than I understand it,\\" Buffett said.Speaking during the company's annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, about the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, Buffett said he thought the government did the right thing in stepping in to guarantee bank deposits above the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation guarantee of 250,000.“It would have been catastrophic,” Buffett said of a situation in which the government didn’t act.

I can't stand tofu.","answer":"1. Seitan - Made from wheat protein, seitan is a popular meat substitute among vegans. Wheat flour dough is rinsed until all of the starch is gone, leaving the gluten. After this, it's steamed, boiled, or baked to give it a meaty texture. Seitan is widely used in vegan deli meats and chicken substitutes.2. Green Spelt - Another wheat-based substitute, green spelt is spelt grain that's harvested while it's partially ripe. It's then roasted and dried, giving it a strong flavor. Green spelt is easy to digest and contains lots of B vitamins, phosphorus, and magnesium, and is used often in vegan meatballs, among other products.3. Oat Flakes - Rich in zinc and iron, they're relatively cheap and available at virtually any supermarket. Oat flakes are made into a dough, fried, and added to vegetable broth, fat, carrots or zucchini, and other proteins. They're also a great source of complex carbohydrates, giving you more of that \\"full\\" feeling after a meal.4. Black Beans - Black beans are commonly used for vegan burger patties, providing a tasty and nutritious alternative to restaurants and store-bought patties. They're rich in protein and fiber and the skins contain powerful antioxidants.5. Chickpeas - Chickpeas are widely used as an alternative to chicken and turkey. They're incredibly protein dense and contain significant amounts of iron, calcium, and fiber. Mashed chickpeas can be mixed with breadcrumbs for tasty vegan nuggets, and they're great on pasta in a vegan meat sauce."},{"question":"Write a professional email to my boss, Sarah, saying I won't make the meeting at 3 pm today and need to reschedule.

Put two questions with their answers in a numbered list.RIO RANCHO, N.M. — When Ashley Daniels saw her second grade son earn a high score on a recent test, she knew he had just guessed the answers and gotten lucky. Daniels called his teacher and said he might need some extra support, despite his good performance on the test.It wasn’t just a mother’s intuition. Daniels watched her son take the test from their dining room table.The second grader attends SpaRRk Academy, a virtual learning program for elementary students created in 2021 by the Rio Rancho School District in New Mexico. Even as doors reopened to brick-and-mortar schools, administrators here saw the continued need for a virtual option in response to lingering concerns about Covid and to feedback from some parents that their children had thrived in online learning.The district assigned 10 full-time teachers to provide live, online classes via Zoom. They also organized an in-person component: Once a week, students would gather in reserved classrooms in a local elementary school, for activities such as science experiments, project-based learning and reading groups. More than 250 kids signed up for SpaRRk.On days when SpaRRk Academy students are learning virtually, the classrooms are empty except for teachers and administrators, who come into the office just about every day. Although students only came in once a week, there were plans to grow that number up to three times per week in the coming years. But, two years in, enrollment had dropped to 87 kids, a 65 percent decrease. Costs had soared to 11,327 per pupil, a 121 percent jump from the year prior and nearly 3,000 more than the average in this district of roughly 17,000 students. SpaRRk Academy’s future sat on shaky ground; the school board announced in late 2022 that it would hold a vote this spring on whether to shutter the academy altogether.Prior to the pandemic, virtual schools were relatively scarce: 691 fully virtual programs enrolled nearly 294,000 students, accounting for less than 1 percent of national public school enrollment, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. But after most schools shifted their classes online in early 2020, remote learning caught on with some families, including those who preferred to give their children the flexibility of learning from home, or whose children struggled with social anxiety in school buildings or hadn’t found success in traditional learning environments.Some 41 percent of districts surveyed in August 2021 by the Clayton Christensen Institute, a nonprofit think tank, said they had opened a full-time virtual school option during the pandemic, and 32 percent planned to maintain these programs after the pandemic subsided.","answer":"1. How did Ashley Daniels know that her second-grade son would need extra support even though he earned a good grade on the assessment he took on about the material? Where does Daniel's son go to school?Daniel's watched her son as he sat at the dining room table and got lucky as he guessed the answers. The second grader attends a virtual school program in Rio Rancho School District in New Mexico. 2. How did Rio Rancho handle the requests for online programming even after most students had returned to the school building? How many students participated in 2021 as compared to the present? The Rio Rancho School District assigned 10 teachers to serve the students in a program where students were in the building one day per week and online the other four days. When the program started in 2021, over 250 students were being served, however, in the past two years enrollment has dropped to it current level of 87 students. 3. How did the virtual program called the SpaRRk Academy operate when it opened? How has the enrollment drop affected the operation and cost per pupil of the school? Even though initially the students came to the school only one day per week, the teachers and principal as well as other staff were in the school building almost every day, and initially planned to gradually increase the number of days students were in the building. With the enrollment dropping steadily for the past two years, the plans have not been fully implemented and the cost has increased 121% and nearly 3000 more than the average per pupil expenditure in the 17,000-student district. 4. How has the school board reacted? How does Rio Ranch compare to the national landscape? The school board announced in 2022 that they would vote in the spring of 2023 on the school's status and whether the school would remain open. In 2021, a nonprofit think tank surveyed school districts with 41% of systems in the nation indicating that they would open an online school and 32% planned to maintain the program in the long term beyond the pandemic.

"},{"question":"Can you summarize the story of Tammuz, the Spring God of Mesopotamia given in this article in no more than five sentences?Here's the article you should use:Tammuz, the Spring God of Mesopotamia In ancient agrarian societies, the last days of winter marked the end of months of meager subsistence and the long-awaited bounty of the spring and summer. In ancient Mesopotamia, one of the first agrarian civilizations, the people turned to divine explanations for these annual cycles of feast and famine. Ishtar was the great mother goddess of Mesopotamia and the source of nature’s fertility and abundance. Her lover was Tammuz, a handsome young god who died each winter and passed away to the shadowy underworld. For six months of the year, Ishtar traveled to the realm of the dead to rescue her lover. During that time, the world was robbed of all fertility, reproduction and growth. Every spring, the stern goddess of the underworld, Allatu, would allow the imprisoned couple to be sprinkled with the Water of Life and return to the world of the living, bringing life and green vegetation back to the earth. In the Babylonian calendar, the resurrection was celebrated during Du'ûzu or “Month of Tammuz,” which fell in late June and early July. All across the ancient Near East, later cultures put their own twist on the spring resurrection story. The Phrygians told the tale of Attis, who was brought back to life on the spring equinox by Cybele, the fertility goddess. The Greeks told the myth of Persephone, kidnapped by Hades, who is allowed to return every spring from the underworld, heralding the return of vegetation and grain production","answer":"Tammuz was an ancient Mesopotamian god, the lover of the mother goddess Ishtar. He would die in every winter causing the earth to lose its fertility. But each spring, Ishtar would rescue him and bring him back to life, leading to the flourishing of new vegetation.

He was overwhelmed by my honesty and said, “I can’t harm you, instead, I will protect you from other wild animals in the future. I want that the character you possess to encourage and impact other animals.”Saying this, the tiger went back into his den.

What are some ways that I can reconcile with her so we can move on and be happy again?","answer":"Being in a relationship takes work and attention. The fact that you're asking this question shows that you want to put in the effort to have a healthy relationship. Here are some things you can do to mend fences with your spouse and begin to move on:1. Communication - One of the most important aspects of a relationship, communication ensures the couple is talking to each other, expressing their feelings, and letting the other person know what they were thinking when they decided to do something. Many times problems in relationships are due to poor communication or a misunderstanding between two people, which could have easily been avoided had they opened up to each other about what was going on. In some cases, telling someone something may hurt their feelings, but being honest is the best course of action when dealing with an upset spouse as lying can make things much worse and put a strain on the relationship.2. Take timeouts - Sometimes being around one another for any extended period can cause feelings of claustrophobia and a sense of loss of privacy. Being around the same person every day, every minute of the day can cause partners to resent each other, especially if they don't have time for themselves to think and process feelings. If you're having problems with your spouse and you feel it getting worse by talking, consider taking a timeout so you can gather your thoughts and have some time to settle your emotions, before you end up saying something that you regret later.3. See a therapist or counselor - Sometimes the problems between spouses are not getting resolved through communication or timeouts, which is where a counselor can come in and provide some much-needed counseling and guidance to the couple. Having a trained, qualified outside observer who is separate from the turmoil and stresses the couple is experiencing can help to put things in perspective for the couple who are not able to see the forest for the trees.4. Don't be too proud to apologize - When couples argue, there may be a power struggle between the two where neither of them wants to concede the argument. Instead of letting your or her pride get in the way of reconciliation, apologize for whatever you did wrong and make amends. Or, if your spouse doesn't want to apologize for what they had done to cause the argument, simply forget about it; but before you drop the subject completely, at the very least let your partner know how their actions or behavior made you feel so you don't continue to harbor any bad feelings toward them going forward."},{"question":"I’m trying to learn how to cook and I keep reading about mirepoix.

It is a combination of onions, carrots, and celery that are diced small and sauteed in some kind of fat. The result is a fantastic base that has deep flavor and a strong aroma that can add great seasoning to elevate a dish. While the traditional versions utilize onions, carrots, and celery, there are a number of other variations that use other aromatic vegetables that can be tweaked to create many different flavor bases.

She thought it would be safe enough tucked away in her jewelry box in her room, but she should have known better. Her mother tends to clean out everything she comes across when it's chore day; her jewelry box would have been no exception. Janet had done a thorough job of scolding Muriel when she got home from school, thinking that Muriel had stolen such a brilliant piece of jewelry. There's no way her meager allowance would have afforded her to purchase such a luxury. How was Muriel supposed to say no when Mrs. Allen, the sweet old lady next door, pressed the necklace in her hand one day when she was coming home from school? Mrs. Allen hadn't said a word, just winked and walked back to her house before Muriel could react. It wasn't until later that night that Muriel heard the necklace singing to her from its place on her dresser. She was too scared to try it on yet, which is why she'd left it burrowed safely in the cushions of her jewelry box. But every night the singing grew louder and louder, the temptation to wear it gaining momentum. Muriel wasn't sure what was going to happen once she tried it on. All that she knew was that she had to get it back before someone else found it. Janet told her daughter that she'd taken it to the local police station. Getting the necklace back was going to be trickier than she thought. "},{"question":"Rewrite this passage about the philosopher Lao Tzu as a series of questions and answers.Lao Tzu was an ancient Chinese philosopher and poet, well-known for penning the book Tao Te Ching. He was the founder of philosophy of Taoism, a religious and ethical custom of ancient China. He is largely respected as a religious deity in various traditional Chinese religious schools of thought. He is also believed by some to be an older contemporary of the famous philosopher Confucius.Lao Tzu’s journey began as he set foot towards the western border of China, currently Tibet. He was saddened by what he saw around him: men being diverted away from nature and the goodness it brings. A guard he met on the border asked Lao to write down his teachings as he went. This is when he wrote the famous Tao Te Ching, a 5,000 character account of his thoughts and philosophical ideas.Like various ancient Chinese philosophers, Lao Tzu made use of rhyme and rhythm, paradoxes and interesting analogies to get his point across in Tao Te Ching. In reality, the entire book can be considered as one great analogy.The ‘Tao Te Ching’, literally meaning ‘The Way and Its Power’ presents the idea of ‘Tao’ as being the end all and be all of existence. It is extremely powerful, yet down to earth. It is the source of all being in the world. The book intends to guide people on how to return to the laws and ways of nature to maintain the balance of the Tao.Tzu is also the father of the Taoist philosophy. Taoism, along with Buddhism and Confucianism, is the pillar of ancient Chinese thought. It is not only a customary philosophy, but it has also taken the shape of a properly organized religion. Though the two elements of religion and philosophy are separate, they are profoundly connected. Lao Tzu’s teachings have encompassed the depths of both.Taoism focuses on leading life according to ‘Tao’ or ‘the path’. It encapsulates moral, ethical and religious Chinese customs. Tao is a concept not exclusive to Taoism; it is also found in various other Chinese philosophies. In Taoism however, it plays a major role. As per Taoism, Tao is deep and overwhelming; it is the all-encompassing. It is both the cause and the effect of every existing thing in the world.Lao Tzu’s philosophy was a simple one. He was against putting effort and striving, as he thought struggle is not only futile but also hinders productivity. In his theory of ‘wu-wei’, he advises to simply do nothing. By this he means not to go against the forces of nature, wait for the gush of events nature brings to you and dive right in. He advised not to struggle to change the natural order of things, but to bring spontaneity to one’s actions as one holds on to the nature’s way of life. Followers of Taoism believe that striving for nothing will never lead them to failure. The one who has never failed is always successful, thus becoming powerful.By understanding this principle, Taoist debates against Confucianism and its endeavors at domination and standardization of all aspects of life, and strives for a lone, deep meditation among nature. Taoists believed that through contemplation, nature will grant them the keys unlocking the powers of the universe. The logic of ‘doing nothing and achieving everything’ reached the rulers and affected the way the kings treated the masses. Thus in a subtle way, Taoism took shape of a political philosophy.Lao Tzu’s works have continued to influence individuals and anti-authoritarian campaigns around the world. Belonging to the sixth century, Lao Tzu, a title given to the great philosopher meaning ‘Old Teacher’, taught the world the importance of the ways of nature and how embracing the principle of doing nothing can help achieve everything.","answer":"Question #1: Who was the ancient Chinese philosopher and poet who was well-known for writing the book \\"Tao Te Ching\\"?Answer #1: Lao Tzu was the Chinese philosopher and poet who wrote \\"Tao Te Ching.\\" He is also largely respected as a religious deity in various religious schools of thought. He was also the founder of Taoism.Question #2: How did Lao Tzu's journey in Tibet lead to his writing of the book \\"Tao Te Ching?\\"Answer #2: On Lao Tzu's journey to what is currently Tibet he had a sad reaction to what was going on around him. There were men diverted away from nature and all its goodness. A guard that Lao Tzu met on his trip asked him to write down his teachings on that trip. The 5,000-character account of his thoughts on that journey became the \\"Tao Te Ching.\\"Question #3: What kinds of writing styles did Lao Tzu employ in the \\"Tao Te Ching?\\"Answer #3: In his book, Lao Tzu used rhyme and rhythm, paradoxes, and analogies.

It is powerful, but down to earth. The book tries to guide people on how to return to the ways and laws of nature to maintain the balance of the Tao.Question #5: What role did Lao Tzu play in Taoism?Answer #5: Lao Tzu is the father of Taoism, which is one of the three pillars of ancient Chinese thought. Taoism is both a philosophy and an organized religion and Lao Tzu's teachings encompassed the depths of both.Question #6: Explain the concept of Tao and what it means.Answer #6: Tao is also known as \\"the path.\\" However, the term is not exclusive to Taoism. It appears in other Chinese religious customs, but the path plays an important role in Taoism. Tao is both the cause and effect of every living being in the world.Question #7: What are some of the highlights of Lao Tzu's philosophical beliefs?Answer #7: Lao Tzu believed that struggling is futile and harms productivity. He believed in the theory of \\"wu-wei,\\" in which he advises others to do nothing. One should just wait for the events that nature brings to you rather than go against the forces of nature. Following the natural order of things, while still being spontaneous, was most important. Taoists believe that striving for nothing will never fail. Someone who has never failed is always successful and eventually powerful.Question #8: Did Taoism influence other things in society?Answer #8: At the center of Taoism, the idea of doing nothing and achieving everything affected the way the kings treated the general public. Because of this, many think that Taoism helped shaped political philosophy as well.Question: #9: Is Taoism influential today?Answer #9: Lao Tzu's writings continue to influence individuals and anti-authoritarian campaigns worldwide. Lao Tzu, known as \\"Old Teacher,\\" put a strong emphasis on the ways of nature and how sometimes doing nothing can have the largest impact on everything."},{"question":"What year was Charles Dickens born?","answer":"What is 1812?"},{"question":"I want to start a vegetable garden this summer. I live in the northeast United States. What are the best vegetables to plant for a beginner?","answer":"Here are some good ones to start with:  1. Peas and pole beans: install a trellis, plant your seeds, and keep them watered. Peas should be planted as early as possible, but you should wait until the soil is at least 60 degrees for the beans.  2. Chard and kale: these can be used for cooking and salads. Leaves can be harvested when the plants are about one foot tall and continue to be harvested well into the fall.  3. Radishes: can be planted at any time of the year and harvested in 30 days.  4. Baby lettuce and salad mixes: sow the seeds in a 2-3 inch-wide band, water, and harvest in 30-40 days.   5. Basil: plant once the soil has warmed to 60 degrees. When the plants reach about 8 inches tall, start harvesting leaves from the bottom up.  6. Scallions: very easy to grow and can be harvested in around 60 days.  7. Summer squash: notoriously simple to grow. Plant two or three seeds in a mound, keep it watered, and check daily for ripe fruit.  8. Peppers: sweet and hot peppers are generally easier to grow than bell peppers. Jalapeno and purple beauty are two of the easiest varieties to grow.  9. Eggplant: Good beginner varieties are little finger, ping tung long, and snowy. Make sure they get plenty of sun.  10. Tomatoes: they need stakes or tomato cages for support, but there are a ton of varieties for beginners to choose from.

B￼ut the flagship Disney+ service also lost 4 million paid subscribers during the quarter—its biggest drop ever and a shock to analysts who expected the service to add 1.7 million subscribers. Disney’s shares fell more than 4% following the report. The quarter ended April 1st was the first full period since Mr. Iger returned to the chief executive officer post at Disney. And it was a busy one, with around half the period consumed by the potential for a proxy battle with an activist investor, and all of it featuring an escalating political fight in Florida. The latter didn’t seem to keep people away from the Magic Kingdom; domestic theme park revenue rose 14% year over year to nearly 5.6 billion, which was slightly ahead of expectations.

At the most basic, a ceramic material is one that is not based around metallic elements or around organic (carbon-hydrogen) molecules. They can usually withstand temperatures of 1,000 degrees Celsius without degrading and some formulations can take much higher heat loads.Some elements on the periodic table can be considered ceramic on their own. Pure carbon and silicon are among the more common elements that can be considered ceramic. Artificial ceramics are made by forming the item you want from clay or a conglomeration of specialty materials and then heating (firing) it until the material will no longer dissolve in water. Many ceramic items are also glazed on the surface so that water cannot soak into the material’s natural pores. Modern materials scientists have formulated specialty ceramics, but at their most basic, humans have been making artificial ceramics for at least 26,000 years. The oldest known archaeological evidence of artificial ceramic items were sculptures. 19,000-year-old pottery fragments are known, but ceramic pottery doesn’t appear to have become very common until about 10,000 years ago."},{"question":"Pretend you're a person who has no car. Create a narrative description for your local bus station using less than 300 words.

","answer":"It’s nothing more than a long strip of cement lined with metallic pink benches behind the husk of an old shopping mall, but for many, it is a gateway to new experiences. No matter the time of day, there are always people coming and going, hopping onto buses adorned with wacky advertisements and flashing white route numbers. Often times you can see people sleeping on or underneath the benches or feeding the already fat street pigeons. Ever since the mall closed down, it’s been kind of a free-for-all at this bus station. No security guards or rule enforcers, just one person crammed into a tiny green ticket booth behind bulletproof glass. Most people don’t mind. They’re just trying to get where they need to go, but every once in a while you’ll find someone who clearly isn’t accustomed to public transportation clutching their pearls at the rundown nature of it all. Where a seasoned traveler would look upon this place and think, “Sweet! A place to sit down!” The average person would be more concerned with the reddish brown splotches on the cracked sidewalk and the thick layer of dust and grime over everything. There was also the way the sun beat directly onto the metal benches without any barriers, meaning they were hot enough to scorch your skin in the dead of summer. Still, that seemed like a small price to pay in exchange for a 2 trip across a massive city. For many people, this “eyesore” is their ticket to freedom. It allows them to commute to school or work, go to the doctor, and visit their families, all  the things that so many people with cars take for granted.

The film is in on the joke. It feels like a friend made it.And that’s the difference between this and so many other video game films. Tyson Hesse, a Sonic fan artist who eventually began official work on the franchise, was brought in to salvage the film from the backlash of the horrifying original design Paramount Pictures proposed.Redesigning Sonic was not only smart, it was necessary.

What color do you think was her favorite and why? Answer in 3 paragraphs.","answer":"Pocahontas is a Native American princess who lives in harmony with nature and respects all living things. She sings “Colors of the Wind” to John Smith, a European explorer who has a different worldview and believes that the land belongs to him. In the song, she challenges him to look beyond his own perspective and see the beauty and value of the natural world.The song’s lyrics are inspired by Native American poetry, music, and folklore, as well as a letter that was attributed to Chief Seattle, a leader of the Suquamish and Duwamish tribes. The letter expresses a deep connection with the earth and a concern for its preservation. The song also uses imagery and metaphors from various cultures, such as the Chinese concept of chi (the breath of life), the Hindu concept of prana (the life force), and the Greek concept of pneuma (the spirit).Based on the song’s message and tone, I think Pocahontas’s favorite color might be green. Green is the color of life, growth, harmony and balance. It is also the color of many plants and animals that Pocahontas loves and protects. Green represents her appreciation for the diversity and interdependence of all living things. Green also symbolizes her hope for a peaceful coexistence between her people and John Smith’s people."},{"question":"Write a tanka poem to my boyfriend.","answer":"My heart, it does beat, pitter patter, pitter pat, but I can't feel it over the flutters in my,butterflies in my stomach"},{"question":"Yesterday, I failed to successfully complete a Captcha on the website for my favorite magazine.

","answer":"Leafy green veggies like lettuce, arugula, and spinach serve as living mulch when grown between taller plants like tomatoes. They grow best with cooler temperatures and filtered sunlight, and the tomato plants shelter them from the intense summer heat and sunshine. In return, the low-growing leafy greens minimize weed growth and protect the soil, keeping it from drying out too quickly.Practice succession planting for a continuous harvest of tasty salad greens throughout the growing season.

However, it was not until 1848 that gold mining really kicked off.In 1848, James Marshall—a carpenter and sawmill operator—went down to the American River in Coloma to inspect progress on a sawmill under construction, and saw something that defined the future of California’s economy.“My eye was caught by something shining in the bottom of the ditch. . . . I reached my hand down and picked it up; it made my heart thump, for I was certain it was gold. . . Then I saw another.”— James Marshall via Library of Congress.As word spread, thousands of prospectors and gold-seekers made their way to California in search of their own shiny nuggets in an event now known as the Gold Rush. In fact, the influx of migrants was so large that they came to be known as the “forty-niners”, named after the year they started arriving. By 1855, miners had extracted over 12 million ounces of gold, and the Gold Rush neared its end.Over a century later, in 1968, “the Golden State” became California’s official nickname for both its prolific gold discoveries and golden poppy fields. By this time, most historical gold mines had ceased operations, but for California’s mining industry, it was just the beginning.Mining in California TodayAlthough California is well-known for Hollywood and Silicon Valley, it remains one of the most important states for mining in the country.As of 2018, there were 739 mines in California producing 23 different commodities, from gold and rare earths to boron and construction minerals. Due to the industry’s size and significance, mining plays an important role in the Golden State’s economy.In 2020, California’s mining industry generated:7.3 billion in labor income13.6 billion in GDP99,120 direct and indirect jobsMining companies in California benefit from access to clean energy, infrastructure, and well-established transport networks. Additionally, the Golden State is also known for its high reclamation standards, which ensure that mining sites are returned to their original undisturbed states, reducing the environmental impact of mines.","answer":"• Known as the Golden State, California has a rich history of gold production in the 19th and 20th centuries.• California is one of the largest states for mining, having produced roughly 4.7 billion worth of non-fuel minerals in 2020.• California's history of discovering gold dates back to the late 1770s when it was a Spanish colony as a group of Spaniards found gold in Imperial County.• James Marshall, a carpenter and sawmill operator, went down to the American River in Coloma and made a startling discovery in the bottom of a ditch; nuggets of pure gold.• The California Gold Rush period officially ran from 1849 to 1855, 12 million ounces of gold had been extracted by miners.• As of 2020, the mining industry in California has generated 7.3 billion in labor income, 13.6 billion in GDP, and 99,120 direct and indirect jobs."},{"question":"Write a short story for kids (about 4 paragraphs) about a talking piece of pizza out for a spring walk.

One day he decided to see for himself, so he climbed out the kitchen window and went for a walk.As Pep strolled through the neighboring park, he felt the warm sun on his crust and the cool breeze blowing through his curls of cheese. He saw butterflies in the sky. He saw flowers fluttering in the grass. He saw squirrels staring at him from a tree. They had never seen a talking pizza before!

This number is a serious decrease from the 40's, 50's, and 1960's when nearly half of people were marrying the person who they would classify as their first love. In fact, this idea of the first love can be seriously detrimental to marriages in jeopardy. Above anyone else, reconnected first loves have the highest rate of infidelity with one another when married to other people. Most brides in this day and age marry at the age of 26, five years older than the average age of brides in the 1970s. This means that to get to marriage, many couples would already have spent nearly a decade together. Now that women make up a significant percentage of the workforce, it's more likely for long-lasting couples to have met at work than in school. There is also a higher likelihood of couples who meet in the workplace having interests and social circles in common, both of which are factors leading to more successful outcomes in marriage. Another reason that high school sweethearts circle back to one another is the perceived comfort. There's something about the first love that is deeply comforting. It usually comes from a time in our lives when our parents were still caring for us but we had an element of freedom. Most of us didn't have financial responsibilities or work requirements that were onerous. We were able to focus on social bonds and experience the power of those bonds for the first time. After children and mortgages or costly rents weigh on us, it can be appealing to revert to that time in our lives when we were cared for and explored both the world around us and the people in it with a sense of safety.

In his plea agreement, California pilot Trevor Jacob admitted to \\"deliberately destroying\\" the plane wreckage and repeatedly lying to officials. The crimes of destruction and concealment with intent to impede a federal investigation carry a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment and a potential fine of up to 250,000. The Los Angeles district court may impose a lesser sentence due to the plea deal, though.Jacob is scheduled to appear in court in the coming weeks, the DOJ reported. A DOJ public information officer, Ciaran McEvoy, told Ars that Jacob has not yet pleaded guilty. After an initial court appearance—essentially a bond hearing—a change of plea hearing will be scheduled. If Jacob pleads guilty at that hearing, a federal judge will schedule a sentencing hearing several months later. From there, Jacob would meet with the US Probation Office, which will draft a confidential pre-sentencing report recommending the sentence that the office thinks he deserves. Jacob and the prosecutors can either agree or disagree with that sentencing report, and then, ultimately, a judge will determine what sentence is imposed.  A former Olympic snowboarder and experienced pilot and skydiver, Jacob hatched his scheme to allegedly deliberately crash his plane on November 24, 2021, after securing a sponsorship and agreeing to promote a company's wallet in a video. The company has not been named, and there is no mention of wallets in the video titled \\"I Crashed My Airplane\\" that's still viewable on YouTube.The real trouble for Jacob apparently started on November 26, 2021, when he reported the crash to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which informed him that \\"he was responsible for preserving the wreckage so the agency could examine it,\\" the DOJ reported. Jacob told an NTSB investigator that he would \\"determine the crash location\\" and provide coordinates. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) launched its own investigation three days later, and according to the plea agreement, over the next few weeks, Jacob started lying to federal investigators rather than cooperating with the investigation.\\"","answer":"A YouTuber by the name of Trevor Jacob has confessed to intentionally crashing his plane for YouTube clicks.

Ice, Ice, BabyWild Emperor penguins are only found in Antarctica. They breed and raise their young mostly on ‘fast ice’, a floating platform of frozen ocean which is connected to the land or to ice shelves. From birth, they spend their entire lives in and around the Antarctic ice, although very rarely vagrants have turned up off the coast of New Zealand.2. Giants of the Penguin WorldEmperors are the biggest of the 18 species of penguin found today, and one of the largest of all birds. They are approximately 120cm tall (about the height of a six year old child) and weigh in at around 40 kg, though their weight does fluctuate dramatically throughout the year.But they would be dwarfed by the ancient ‘mega-penguins’. Fossils recovered from the Antarctic Peninsula reveal that a colossus species of penguin which lived about 37 million years ago may have stood 2m tall and weighed as much as 115 kg.3. How many penguins?There are approximately 595,000 adult Emperor penguins in Antarctica. But due to a lack of research, there is still so much we don't know about these magnificent polar creatures. That's why we're funding research in the Antarctic, because the more we know, the better we can protect them. This will encourage the formation of Marine Protected Areas and will help in protecting the species in the face of climate change.Emperor penguin colonies have been discovered and counted from space. A survey led by British scientists in 2012 used satellite technology to identify emperor colonies from the poo stains left on the ice at breeding sites. They discovered a number of previously unvisited colonies and counted every individual penguin. In there are now thought to be around 54 Emperor colonies in the Antarctic.  About half of these have been discovered by satellite survey and most of these remain unvisited.5. Penguin LoveEmperors incubate their eggs during the long dark southern winter months. Courtship displays are intricate but copulation is quick and the female lays a single egg in May or June. She then passes it over to her mate to incubate - and she’s off. She spends the next nine weeks at sea, feeding.The male carefully balances the egg on his feet for between 65 – 75 days to keep it warm in a specially adapted brood pouch, and off the snow surface, before it hatches. Then out pops a fluffy chick.6. ‘Baby, its cold outside’Emperors are uniquely adapted to survive these harsh conditions when temperatures can drop down to a bone chilling -50°C and with winds of up to 200km/hr. They have two layers of feathers, a good reserve of fat and proportionally smaller beaks and flippers than other penguins to prevent heat loss. Emperors also have feathers on their legs, so their ankles don’t get too chilly.Even their feet are adapted to the icy conditions, containing special fats that prevent them from freezing and strong claws for gripping the ice.But most remarkably, colonies of adults and chicks work together to huddle for warmth. 5,000 or more tightly packed adults and chicks shuffle around, so each takes a turn - but not too long - on the outside of the huddle where it’s cold. This is in complete contrast to their quarrelsome and territorial neighbours, the Adélie penguins.7. Dive, Dive Dive!Emperor penguins are the Olympic divers of the bird world. The deepest recorded dive was 564 m – that’s the equivalent of nearly 2 x the height of the Shard, Europe’s tallest building. And the longest recorded dive was nearly 28 minutes. That’s incredible!8. Fish suppersEmperors feed mostly on Antarctic silverfish as well as other species of fish, krill (like Will & Bill from Happy Feet) and some squid. An adult penguin eats about 2-3 kg per day, but on a good day they can eat twice this much to build up their store of body fat for the long winter, or for feeding their chicks.","answer":"Here's a quiz generated from penguin facts you shared:QUESTION 1: How many continents do wild Emperor penguins reside on?ANSWER: One continent.

We are trying to stay away from screens at dinnertime. ","answer":"Going to eat at a restaurant sounds like a fun night out with your family! Here are four ways to keep your kids entertained without electronics while you wait for your food to be served! 1. See who can make the most creative origami from straw wrappers. If you watch people at restaurants, many of them will naturally, often unconsciously start folding and looping straw wrappers while waiting on their food. You can take it a step further by hosting a straw wrapper contest at your table. Craft roses, rings, and wriggly worms, then take turns showing off the creations to the rest of the family. Don’t be surprised if your kiddos want to get the server involved because they’re proud of their straw wrapper origami skills! 2. Ask a lot of fun, silly, interesting questions! Kids are naturally inquisitive and imaginative, and they have a lot going on in their minds at all times. Go around the table and ask questions that are fun, silly, and sometimes weird, like: •\\tWould you rather teach a bear to dance or ride a rhinoceros? •\\tDo you think unicorns toot rainbows and glitter? •\\tYou’re a superhero. What’s your weirdest superpower? The sillier and more thought-provoking the questions, the more engaged and communicative your kids will be. 3. Play a classic “see and sight” game, like I Spy. Remember playing I Spy when you were a kid? It’s where you find something in a room, describe it, and others try to guess what you see. They can ask yes or no questions. This is a fun game because you can tailor it to any age. 4. Craft pieces of a story from one person to another until you either have your food or a complete story. Invoke the power of imagination when you suggest making up a story with your family. Everyone gets to tell a piece of the story in one or two sentences as they go around the table. Stories will get weird quickly, but they can be as short or as long as anyone wants them to be. Keep going around the table until 1) you’ve completed the story or 2) your food has arrived! When you go to restaurants as a family, the aim is to share that experience. It’s hard to bond over screens, so use the aforementioned entertainment tips to ensure your family has a great time!

It plays a crucial role in energy production, protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, and blood pressure regulation. Magnesium is also important in bone development and helps with DNA and RNA synthesis. Despite its importance, magnesium deficiency, or hypomagnesemia, is not uncommon and can result from various factors such as poor dietary intake, chronic alcoholism, certain medications, or problems with intestinal absorption. Symptoms of magnesium deficiency can range from mild to severe. Mild symptoms may include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weakness. As the deficiency worsens, more serious symptoms can develop such as numbness, tingling, muscle cramps, seizures, personality changes, abnormal heart rhythms, and coronary spasms. Long term magnesium deficiency can also lead to more chronic conditions. For example, it can exacerbate osteoporosis by affecting the balance of calcium in the body and reducing the effectiveness of Vitamin D. Several studies have associated low magnesium levels with chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and migraine headaches."},{"question":"I want a scene where a woman is leading an unfulfilled, businesswoman's life where her boss is extremely demanding.

Slow petting, similar to gentle massage or light scratching, is calming to them.A comfortable bedDogs sleep a lot – up to 18 hours a day, depending on their age. So, they need a comfy place to sleep just like you do. Dogs need a soft, supportive place to relax.

Playing with youDogs love to play, and playing with you, their Number One Person, is their favorite way to play. Play helps young dogs develop motor skills as well as coping skills for real-life stressors. Play promotes a social bond as well as releasing pent-up energy. But mostly, dogs love to play with you just to have fun with you! Going for walks Dogs have a natural enthusiasm for being out in nature. They love going out and are naturally active creatures.

They’re doing what dogs do: communicating with other dogs by leaving urine marks.Believe it or not, a dog’s urine marking is serious business for dogs. It’s an instinctual behavior going back thousands of years. By urine marking, your dog is leaving a message for other dogs, so to speak. When other dogs come along and sniff the area, they will know your dog has been there and they will most likely leave their own message by urinating in the same or adjacent spot. This unique form of communication can even tell other dogs if they sense danger or are available sexually.

Please give me a brief rundown of the genres of games that are available to play.","answer":"Sure thing! Here is a brief overview of the different types of video games available to play:1. Role-Playing Games (RPG) - Role-playing games involve playing a fictional character (you can design an avatar of yourself to play in the game) in a certain setting (fantasy, dungeon, wasteland) and playing out a storyline that can organically evolve. The hallmarks of RPGs include an experience-based leveling system, equipment (weapons, armor) that can add attributes (faster running, increased resistance to damage), and quests (tasks that can be completed for experience, equipment, or in-game currency.)2. First-Person Shooters (FPS) - First-person shooters are shooting games that put you directly in the game character's shoes as if you were seeing everything through their eyes. FPS games usually revolve around either a single-player campaign where the player fights against enemies using a variety of guns through multiple levels, or in multiplayer online matches with other human players (Deathmatch, King-of-the-Hill, Capture-the-Flag, or Cooperative play).3. Fighting Games - Fighting games are games that usually involve two players (either a human against a computer-controlled character or a human versus another human) fighting against each other using many different fighting techniques, including hand-to-hand combat, weapons combat, and sometimes even superpowers such as laser beams or energy blasts. The winner of the match is the player left standing.4. Sports Games - Sports games are digital representations of sports that are available in real life (basketball, football, hockey). Sports games allow you to play as a player in a sports game, playing the game as it would be played in real life. Some of these games are made so well that every detail seems almost life-like, and may include real players from the real sports making cameos in the games as playable characters.5. Side Scroller/Platform Games - Side scroller and platform games are 2-dimensional games where the player controls a character who moves from left to right or vice-versa on the screen and must navigate obstacles such as walls or ladders through jumping (via platforms) or climbing. 6. Multiplayer Online Battle Arena Games (MOBA) - MOBAs are games that are played online against multiple other human players in a game setting. The games usually consist of groups of players on separate teams attempting to beat each other either by eliminating the opposing team's players or by capturing an objective (such as a flag or castle). The difference between MOBAs and first-person shooters may seem small, but MOBAs do have added features such as different skills for players that can add new dimensions to the game and foster cooperation and communication between teammates to win a match.7. Action-Adventure Games - Action-adventure games usually involve playing a character in a situation that involves action and/or adventure, such as exploring caves or climbing mountains.8. Stealth Games - Stealth games require cunning and quiet to kill enemies and maneuver through the game environment. Many stealth games are based around characters that would require stealth to perform their duties, such as ninjas and assassins.9. Survival Games - Survival games are about playing a character who must survive in their surroundings or the environment. Game modes include surviving against multiple hordes of enemies such as zombies or other enemy combatants using weapons or tools designed to hurt or kill your enemies.10. Simulation Games - Simulation games allow you to simulate fictional or real-life scenarios in a game setting. Some examples of simulation games include simulating real life (owning a house, interacting with neighbors, making meals), being a farmer (operating a tractor, tending to the land, growing crops), or even pressure-washing dirty fences. There are many simulation games to choose from."},{"question":"Give me 3 unique and creative prompts for a fantasy story. All these prompts should be written in second-person.

Make Use of Employee Referrals - One of the most highly effective hiring strategies for today's growing companies is using employment referrals. This is a process that uses a person's professional network to find the best possible talent. Think about improving your employee referral program by switching to a stipend system for successful hires. When you choose to create a culture of respect toward these referrals, you can give your own networking connections a boost as well. 2. Create a Positive Experience for Candidates - The way your prospective new talent feels about the hiring process will be based on the interactions they have with your hiring manager and anyone else they talk to at your company. Their experience may also include other interactions that take place without another person involved such as the online job application process or automated responses to their application submission. 3. Consider Your Internal Recruits - Sometimes recruiting new talent internally for different positions can be more rewarding than hiring new employees. Hiring internally will reduce the amount of time it takes to hire, onboard, or train a new worker. It also cuts down on additional costs for advertising on job boards or paying for background checks. Plus, when you hire someone internally, you are typically dealing with a smaller amount of candidates, which will save you time during the screening and interviewing process. 4. Make Diversity Your Priority - Having a team with diverse ideas, experiences, and backgrounds can increase your company's effectiveness and drive more innovation for your brand. Ensuring diversity is prioritized during the hiring process is a great way to guarantee a broad representation of staffing, which will help you work toward the best possible outcomes for workplace equity. 5. Use a Rubric - One cornerstone of the hiring process is clear expectations. Using an interview rubric, or a checklist to analyze candidates may communicate transparency within your hiring process and make sure that the most qualified candidates will apply for the job. An interview rubric is a scoring tool that defines expectations and assists in determining who to interview, who you should call to interview again, and who to offer the new job to. This form of the rubric can be used to objectively measure both tangible and intangible details like relevant experience and demeanor.

The cities are powered by advanced fusion reactors and have self-sustaining ecosystems that provide food and water for the inhabitants. However, life on New Eden is far from easy, as the planet is teeming with alien life forms that are both dangerous and wondrous, and the colonists must constantly struggle to survive in this new and unpredictable world.

We know that Vitamin D is necessary for good bone health. But there are many other functions for this vitamin. For instance, in recent years we have found that vitamin D can have a strong impact on the body's musculoskeletal system. Vitamin D affects your bones, muscles, joints and tissues.We have known for a long time that vitamin D is important for bone health. One of the jobs of vitamin D is to help your gut absorb the calcium and phosphorus from your diet. These minerals in turn help build and maintain the strength of your bones. Low levels of vitamin D have been linked to stress fractures and other problems with the bones.But vitamin D has many other functions as well. I describe it to my patients as a delicate symphony of everything that goes on in your body. If one of the instruments — in this case, your vitamin D — is off, it can throw off the whole symphony.In recent years, we have learned more about how vitamin D affects the entire musculoskeletal system. We recently conducted research that looked at vitamin D levels in young women between the ages of 16 and 40 who were treated in the Women's Sports Medicine Center for a variety of problems with their lower extremities. These included injuries to the ligaments, tendons, cartilage and muscles, as well as the bones.We found that nearly 66% of them had low levels of vitamin D in the blood; about three-fifths were insufficient and the rest were actually deficient. Low blood levels were found in patients with acute injuries as well as overuse injuries. Because these rates of low vitamin D are higher than what's seen in the general population, they suggest a link between low vitamin D and musculoskeletal injuries. More research is needed to confirm this connection.","answer":"Vitamin D affects your bones, muscles, joints, and tissues.

Ability to pay on credit. Sometimes you don't have enough money to pay for something, but you really need it. A credit card lets you purchase a product as soon as you want and then pay off the balance over time. Certain situations can be highly beneficial, such as expensive emergencies or wanting to spread the costs of a large purchase over time. 2. Most accepted payment method. Retailers almost universally accept credit cards. This means you can carry one card around instead of constantly withdrawing cash. Visa and Mastercard are the largest payment processors for credit cards, and you will find that they are accepted almost everywhere in the world. This is an excellent benefit if you travel a lot and don't want to keep track of currencies. 3. Interest-free cash withdrawals.Some credit cards allow users to withdraw large amounts of cash without paying interest for up to 45 days. This can be extremely useful in emergencies. 4. Reward points. Credit cards often give users reward points for using their cards. This means you get extra value on your purchases simply by using a credit card. Certain credit cards offer specific rewards for specific spending categories giving users a bonus for spending money, for example, on travel. These rewards are often limitless, which gives customers an excellent opportunity to get maximum value from the card. 5. Insurance. Credit cards offer significant security measures such as insurance. Having personal accident coverage and travel insurance just for having a credit card is a massive benefit that entices credit card users. As well as this, credit cards also offer a sense of security as users are often able to get refunds on transactions that they did not receive a product or in instances where the product was not as described. 6. Make travel easy. Some credit cards give you great travel benefits. As well as not worrying about organizing local currency, some credit cards offer discounts on flights, dining out, and hotels. Credit cards sometimes offer reward bonuses for money spent on travel. Sometimes, your credit card can give you priority access to airport lounges and other areas.7. Discount and cashback. Similar to rewards, credit cards offer users exceptional discounts for spending at preferred stores and sometimes offer money back as cashback. Money for free is a great benefit of using a credit card.8. Improve your credit score. If you want to buy a house or secure a loan, you must have a strong credit history and rating. A credit card improves your credit score by showing you can be trusted to repay your borrowed money. Along with smaller bills like phone and tv subscriptions, this is the best way to build a credit history. 9. Safety. Not having to carry cash around can make you feel a lot safer. A credit card allows you to carry just one card and have far more money than cash. 10. Keep track of expenses. If you regularly use cash to pay for things, tracking your expenses can be difficult without much effort. Using a credit card will mean receiving monthly statements outlining every transaction. This makes it much easier to see where your money is spent and make informed decisions regarding your spending.

The outer layer is coarse. Coat lengths vary from short to long. Border collies generally have two different types of coats:Rough-coated border collies have long to medium outer coats. They have feathering on their face, stomach, and legs. Their undercoat can be dense and rough-coated collies need frequent grooming to prevent matting. These dogs may look similar to the iconic Lassie. Smooth-coated border collies have short hair all over and little feathering. Their undercoat may be thinner and they may have straight or wavey outer coats. Their coat is much easier to maintain and this type of coat is often preferred on farms and ranches. Of course, border collies can also have a mixture of coat types. There are also uncommon coat types such as curly-coated and bearded.

Use humor, but overall don’t forget to use art terms college students would be able to understand.","answer":"M.C. Escher’s ‘Relativity’ is the gold standard for those who love art, optical illusions, and defying the laws of physics. It can even be the centerpiece of your collection if you adore a good mental workout. Let’s go on to dissect this iconic piece properly.There is, of course, masterful use of perspective––it’s definitely a metaphorical elephant in the room. It’s certainly not unusual to see a three-point perspective, but to see the vanishing points form a triangle is impressive. If you remember from early school days, you’ll know a typical formation of a three-point perspective involves two horizon vanishing points and the third being above or below.As for lines, Escher used cross-hatching to create depth and shading. Even the faceless humanoid figures look eerily real due to the expert lines. The direction of the lines is also important, as they seem to mold the structures within the pieceIn conclusion, M.C. Escher’s ‘Relativity’ takes us through a parallel dream world in which gravity is only a suggestion and not a law. You could pick out symbolism and references, but a technical artist will argue that perspective and line are the show's stars."},{"question":"Turn this text into a diary entry of an astronaut witnessing these events in space.\\"Nasa's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) captures the fully illuminated 'dark side' of the moon as it crosses in front of the Earth.

They meet and fall in love years after John became infatuated with her after seeing her picture in the newspaper, but he doesn't realize it was her until he sees a framed copy of the newspaper in her home.","answer":"As a teenager, Christine loved taking her dog for a run in the park. One warm spring day, a newspaper photographer was in the park and asked Christine if he could take her picture. The next day, the front page of the paper featured a full-color picture of Christine and her dog, running through a cascade of water from sprinklers at the park. It was a beautiful photo of a young woman full of youth and vitality. John was a shy teenager in the same city, and he also enjoyed running. He saw Christine’s photo and was instantly struck by it. There was something that drew him to the girl in the picture and he wondered who she was. John tucked the picture away in his desk drawer and thought about the girl in the picture often. She became his unattainable ideal, and no other girl could quite measure up to this ideal.The years passed, and Christine and John grew up and moved on. Christine married young and had two children, then found herself divorced and a single parent. John never married but went on to study law and then spent long hours at his law practice. Both of them kept running. About ten years after high school, John and Christine both entered a marathon in their city. On the day of the race, Christine struck up a conversation with John and they agreed to meet up after the marathon. That was the beginning of several meetings and dates. Eventually, Christine knew it was time to bring John home and introduce him to her children. Christine invited John to her apartment for dinner, and her two boys took to John immediately. While Christine finished up the dinner preparations, the kids gave John a tour of the apartment. The hall leading to the bedrooms was a photo gallery of family pictures, and John stopped to look. His eyes were drawn to a framed picture from a newspaper. It suddenly dawned on him that this picture of a girl running with her dog was one that he had saved from the newspaper so many years before, and this was his dream girl. Reading the caption below the photo, he realized it was Christine and his dream had come true."},{"question":"Write a one-paragraph story about going for a walk from a dog's perspective and make it simple enough for kids as young as five years old.","answer":"My name is Arthur and I am a Golden Retriever, my favorite hobby in the world is to go for walks with my owner. Let me tell you what is so fun about walks. First off, it is all the different things you can smell; as a dog, my sense of smell is very strong, much stronger than a human's. When I walk around outside, I can smell all the other dogs that came before me! and find out about all the friends I could have in my neighborhood. Sometimes I get to see dogs too! and if I'm really lucky, we meet up close. Some dogs aren't as friendly as I am, but a lot of them are, and getting to say hi to them is really fun. Another thing that's great about walks is that I get to look around at all the different houses. Sometimes when people are gardening outside they'll talk to me and pet me and sometimes I get to chase their cats, but I am only playing, I love cats too. The last thing that I love about walks is that I get to spend quality time with my human. It's fun to play with my human inside the house too, but doing the thing I love most with the person I love most is better than anything."},{"question":"How many notes are there in the musical scale?","answer":"The notes in a typical Western musical scale consist of twelve notes in each octave: C, D, E, F, G, A, and B, plus five flats and equivalent sharps in between.

It was a little earlier than he was used to getting up, but that was ok. He was patient. Carefully, he made his way out of the alley, avoiding broken bottles and sharp cans as he went. There were a few people on the streets today, but not too many this early. Most were already at work or were starting their shift later. Marco went to his first stop: the butcher shop. Every morning, Jenkins would throw out some scraps for him. It was lucky he'd chosen that particular back door one rainy night in August. Jenkins had seen him and taken pity on him by throwing a few scraps. The rest was history.After his morning meal of liver and fish guts, Marco sauntered around his usual haunts. He preferred to sit in the entrance to the alley; people were a little too friendly, even with an alley cat that undoubtedly had fleas. He would rummage through the trash cans or snag scraps from the dumpsters. Occasionally, he would get lucky and find some fresh food that someone had left behind. Frequenting the restaurants was always a good idea, especially if the servers were a little slow to clean up the leftovers. Of course, Marco wasn't lazy. He would nab a rat, mouse, or other small rodent from time to time if the opportunity presented itself. Anything to survive.After a long day of hunting, he returned home and began to clean. His sharp ears picked up a noise, and in the dark of the alley, he saw a pair of glowing eyes.\\"This is our turf now. Get lost,\\" a voice growled. Although the cat had told him to leave, they seemed to want to instill the lesson with a few scratches. Marco dashed past one of them toward the entrance. He knew every inch of this alley even without the visual cues, so it didn't surprise him when one of the cats in pursuit stepped on a broken glass bottle and began to wail.The noise stopped the others, and Marco made a quick escape.

Yes, he knew his name was silly, but like the rest of us, he had no choice in the matter and would prefer if you didn't mention it. Thank you very much. As he sat on the grocery shelf, gently shivering in the cold next to his carton-mates, Eggbert daydreamed of the moment he finally would be purchased and brought home. You might wonder why an egg was so eager to be purchased and inevitably eaten. And it's a myth, Eggbert will tell you, that grocery items don't desire to be eaten. Much like any one of us who dreams of leading our lives in fulfilling, self-actualized ways, Eggbert believed in his heart that being part of a balanced breakfast was the greatest role an egg could strive for. Having never actually been fertilized, he had no desire to hatch into anything and sat patiently as time passed, keeping himself occupied with daydreams of being cracked and fried into the perfect omelet. A few days later, his carton finally reached the front of the shelf. He and his carton-mates could hardly contain their excitement, as each passing shopper might be their ticket to eggy nirvana. Soon enough, he watched as a young mother approached with a small child in tow. Reaching forward towards their carton, Eggbert knew his time had come. She lifted them up and opened the carton to inspect each one of the eggs. This was the moment, Eggbert knew. He was about to be purchased and brought home. Just then, the young woman's child tugged and shouted something incoherently, as children do, knocking the carton out of her hand. As they tumbled to the ground, almost in slow motion, Eggbert saw his life flash before his eyes. At the moment of impact, Eggbert felt his shell crack, with all his nutritious insides spilling out across the floor. His carton-mates didn't fare much better, either, laying in shards around him. As he lay there, devasted and literally broken, Eggbert cursed the gods who gave him such sentience and depth of emotion. Life was too cruel."},{"question":"Write me a short poem about vacations.

Luka sighed and grabbed his phone to use as a flashlight, he started down the hill to retrieve his ball. He shined his light through the bushes and grass, but could not find his ball. Luka went deeper into the woods and continued to search. As he went deeper, he noticed his flashlight was not the only thing giving off light. Luka turned off his flashlight and looked around, he saw a glowing white light through the cracks of trees. He slowly advanced toward it until he saw it clearly at last. There was a bright-white orb, floating above the bushes, and engraved in the middle was writing that said: \\"Jump Boost\\". Luka did not hesitate as he reached his hand outwards towards it, as soon as his fingers had made contact, the orb vanished and he felt an empowering feeling in his body.

But the journey that these little gems make, from formation to the jewelry store, is really quite impressive. How is a natural diamond formed? Where are diamonds found? What are diamonds made of? This precious stone poses numerous questions.Several loose diamondsIn this article, we’ll explore the main ways diamonds are formed and where diamonds are found. From deep beneath the earth’s surface to a well-regulated lab, you might be surprised by where these dazzling stones are found.ARE DIAMONDS MADE FROM COAL?Contrary to what you might have learned in science class, diamonds are not made from coal. The old wives’ tale that diamonds were once pieces of coal that have evolved after years under high pressure and temperature is nothing more than a common myth. In fact, diamonds are actually much older than the earth’s plant material, the main ingredient for coal creation.A rough diamondAn additional flaw in this theory is that coal seams are sedimentary rocks that often occur in horizontal layers. So what are diamonds made of? The source rocks of diamonds are found in vertical layers combined with igneous rocks. A natural diamond is made of carbon when carbon atoms bond together under pressure and form the crystals you see in diamonds.HOW ARE DIAMONDS FORMED?Simply put, diamond formation occurs when carbon deposits deep within the earth(approximately 90 to 125 miles below the surface) are subject to high temperature and pressure. Some stones take shape in a matter of days or months, while others take millions of years to materialize. In the case of colored diamonds, the color is caused by trace elements interacting during the diamond’s formation. Additionally, it’s almost impossible to determine a diamond’s exact age, but inclusions of specific minerals help geologists to form an estimate.That being said, most natural diamonds date back millions, if not billions of years. And, interestingly enough, diamond growth isn’t always an uninterrupted process. A rough diamond’s formation can be disturbed due to a change in temperature or pressure. The gemstone could then wait for hundreds or even millions of years for conditions to be suitable for growth to continue.METHODS OF DIAMOND FORMATIONThere are four main processes that are believed to be responsible for nearly all diamond deposit sites found near the earth’s surface – diamond formation in the earth’s mantle, diamond formation in a subduction zone, diamond formation at impact sites, and diamond formation in space.Diamond Formation in the Earth’s MantleGeologists believe that nearly 100% of the diamonds found in diamond mines, and thus used in engagement rings, were formed in the upper mantle and delivered to the earth’s surface by a deep-source volcanic eruption. These volcanic eruptions are credited with creating the kimberlite and lamproite pipes that gemstones are found in.Geology.com explains these kimberlite pipes and their relation to diamond mining as the following, “Most of these pipes do not contain diamond, or contain such a small amount of diamond that they are not of commercial interest. However, open-pit and underground mines are developed in these pipes when they contain adequate diamonds for profitable mining. Diamonds have also been weathered and eroded from some of these pipes.”Diamond Formation in Subduction ZonesThis second method of diamond formation occurs when rocks are pushed into what geologists call “subduction zones” by tectonic plates and then return to the surface with tiny diamonds. Interestingly, the small rough diamonds formed in subduction zones grow just 50 miles below the earth’s crust at temperatures as low as 390 degrees Fahrenheit(yes, that’s low compared to the usual 2,000 degrees).A diamond mineRocks that have journeyed to subduction zones and back are super rare. No known commercial diamonds have been found within them as they are very small and not sold by jewelers. However, an interesting discovery was made as some stones uncovered from subduction zones are believed to contain traces of oceanic crust, appearing as blue diamonds.Diamond Formation at Impact SitesThroughout its history, Earth has been subjected to a hit or two from a few asteroids(just ask the dinosaurs). When an asteroid collides with the earth, it produces intense pressure and temperatures, two qualities that are perfect for creating diamonds. This process can be viewed at several asteroid impact sites around the globe, two of the most popular of which are the Popigai Crater in Siberia, Russia and, the Meteor Crater in Arizona.Diamond Formation in SpaceLittle green men aren’t the only things floating around in space. NASA researchers have found large amounts of nanodiamonds in some meteorites. Unfortunately, these diamonds are far too small to use for diamond jewelry or industrial abrasives, but they still make for a fun discovery.What’s more, the Smithsonian found large amounts of tiny diamonds in the Allen Hills meteorite, providing more evidence that space diamonds are indeed a thing.","answer":"How Are Diamonds Formed?Have you ever asked yourself how diamonds form? They are so common because they are worn with all sorts of jewelry, but most people don't know where they come from. These little gems travel a long way before they reach the jewelry store. So how are they formed?In this article, we will look at the main ways diamonds form and the places where we can find them. You will be surprised at all the facts about these sparkly stones. Here is a list of more information about diamonds:1. Diamonds are not made from coal. Some may say diamonds form from coal, but that is a myth. Diamonds are much older than the plants that were the main ingredient for coal.2. Coal seams are rocks in horizontal layers, but diamonds are in vertical layers.3. The source of diamonds is carbon. When carbon atoms bond under pressure, they form crystals; crystals are what you see when you look at a sparkly diamond.4. Diamond formation happens very deep under the surface of the planet Earth. This formation occurs 90 - 125 miles deep. Some are made quickly, in days or months, but most others take millions of years to form.5. There are colored diamonds; that color is the elements that were present during the formation of the diamond.6. In its present condition, it is impossible to determine the exact age of a diamond, but geologists who study specific minerals can estimate approximately how old they are.7. A rough diamond formation can be paused if the temperature or pressure changes. It can take a break for hundreds or even millions of years before it continues to form.8. Four main processes are responsible for most diamonds in the world: diamond formation in planet Earth's mantle, diamond formation in a subduction zone, diamond formation at impact sites, and diamond formation in space.9. The vast majority of diamonds formed in diamond mines are found in the upper mantle and come to the surface with the help of volcanic eruptions.10. Open-pit and underground mines contain enough diamonds for profitable mining.11. When rocks are moved into the subduction zones by tectonic plates, they can return to the surface with diamonds. In these subduction zones, diamonds grow only 50 miles deep at temperatures as low as 390 degrees. That's cold compared to the  2,000 degrees it usually takes!12. Rocks that have traveled to subduction zones and back are very small and not interesting for commercial use, but some stones came from that zone as blue diamonds.13. Throughout history, Earth has been impacted by a few asteroids. These asteroids created a lot of pressure and very high temperatures. These conditions are excellent for diamond formation. For this reason, diamond retrieval at asteroid impact sites is not uncommon. Diamonds are in impact sites such as the Popigai Crater in Siberia and the Meteor Crater in Arizona.14. NASA researchers have found large amounts of tiny diamonds in some meteorites. Unfortunately, these diamonds are so tiny that they are too small for the jewelry industry.So there you have it; this is how diamonds form and appear on the Earth's surface."},{"question":"Given the information found in the following article, can you tell me the logic behind allowing the children to assist in designing their school's architecture?:Classrooms are arranged around an indoor rainforest. Porthole windows that look like googly eyes peering out from lumpy, butter-colored walls. Zigzagging roofs and soaring archways. If this mind-bending vision sounds like something that might have been dreamt up by school pupils, that’s because it was – and now those dreams have become reality in the eccentric, off-kilter shape of Madrid’s Reggio school (main picture).Designed by Spanish architect Andrés Jaque, the Reggio’s radical construction not only brings nature indoors but also encourages plant and animal life to colonize its ‘living’ exterior walls.Clad in an insulating mixture of mashed cork, it offers an ideal habitat, not unlike the surface of a tree, for fungi, insects and microbial life. Classrooms look out onto gardens – some inaccessible to humans – created by ecologists to attract birds, butterflies, bats and bees. Inside, a courtyard hosts the miniature temperate rainforest which rises two stories to the glass canopy above. Labs and workshops are arranged around its edges.The school’s design is a living embodiment of the radical Reggio-Emilia method, an educational philosophy developed in postwar Italy. It sees children not as empty vessels to be filled with education, but as active participants in defining their curriculum.Experience – touching, listening and first-hand discovery – lie at the heart of the learning process. Connection with the outdoors is key and the physical environment is imagined as the ‘third teacher’, with spaces configured to encourage open-ended exploration.","answer":"Because they share the same educational values as the radical Italian education reformer Reggio Emilia, the administration and teachers of this school invited the students to participate in the design of the facility.

","answer":"Young Cai was a farmer's son who wanted to become a Knight of the Round Table. He admired King Arthur and his Knights and read the stories of their legendary exploits. Cai often dressed in a wooden barrel for armor, played with a wooden stick for a sword, and imagined himself as a knight.Seeing this, Cai's father sent him to King Arthur to become a page, a servant for the king. Arthur accepted Cai on one condition: Cai must go to the Sea of Blood and stay there for a night, braving the terrors and evils that surround the waters. Cai, determined to make a name for himself, went to the Sea of Blood on horseback, taking his wooden barrel armor and stick for protection.Cai sat at the edge of the Sea and marveled at the blood-red waters. The Blood Sea sustained no life; in fact, this body of water was red from the bloodshed over centuries of war in this area. Legend said that at night, the Sea gave up its dead in the form of zombies and spirits that terrorized those who dared to come near it. As the sun set over the bloody horizon, Cai saw thousands of undead warriors and knights popping up through the surface of the waters, walking toward Cai menacingly. Appearing to be brave and unafraid - but inwardly horrified and petrified - Cai stood at the ready with his wooden sword in his hand. As he faced the undead army, a hand protruded from the middle of the sea holding a golden battleaxe. The hand threw the ax at Cai's feet, at which time Cai grabbed the ax and held it above his head, the moonlight glistening on its sharp edge.The undead army stopped in its tracks as if they had seen a ghost, then they backed off and reentered into the waters, never to approach Cai again.Cai returned to Arthur the next morning, unharmed.

Here are some ideas:1. Cauliflower crust pizza. Pizza is always a favorite, but incorporating cauliflower crust sneaks in more veggies and fewer carbs. Bonus points if you get veggies in as a topping.2. Healthy tacos. Kids love building their own tacos at dinner. Make a filling using lean ground beef or turkey, and add black beans and veggies.3. Turkey burgers. Everyone loves a burger, not just kids! Use turkey and fresh veggies like tomato or avocado to make it a little more rounded.4. Air fryer chicken tenders. Taking the deep fryer away from this kid's favorite will make it a more sensible option.5. Spaghetti with healthy meatballs.

The book review is written by a female. It should be negative. Keep it under 200 words.","answer":"       Primates of Park Avenue sounded like a book that I so desperately wanted to like. It had all of the elements that women like myself find alluring: gossip, decadence, and the age-old good vs evil aspect, where the underdog in me wants the 'good guys' to win in the scenario. That being said, I ended up feeling rather disappointed for the following reasons. Entire chapters were devoted to what seemed to be promotional marketing. Products and services were described so excessively that they consumed page upon page, even entire chapters.  It came across as an infomercial in book form. I couldn't help but wonder if Wednesday had stock in these goods and services. Another disappointing aspect was the political tone that it seemed to take at times. It is so much more pleasant to read from an unbiased author who can keep a neutral tone. I was expecting to be entertained and not indoctrinated.

I didn't do a loading phase but my husband did, just explain this.  ","answer":"Narrator: If you're watching this video, you may be wondering what a creatine loading phase is, how to do one, and if it's necessary or not. We will get to all of these things as well as discuss my own personal experience with different creatine supplementation methods. Narrator: My husband and I decided to try creatine supplementation for the first time. He did a loading phase before switching to a daily maintenance dose and I did not, I just started with a daily maintenance dose. If you just want to hear about this personal experience, go ahead and skip to about [time stamp] in this video. Narrator: A loading phase of creatine is when you take a large amount of creatine in a short amount of time to saturate your muscles quickly with creatine. Narrator: Most people's baseline muscular creatine stores are only at around 60-80%, so this means that we can increase the creatine in our muscles by roughly 20-40% through supplementation. Narrator: The standard dosing recommendation for a creatine loading phase is 20-25 grams for 5-7 days. Now, this is a GENERAL recommendation, and your exact amount in grams could fall outside of this range depending on your weight. A more precise calculation is your body weight in kilograms multiplied by 0.3. Narrator: After the initial loading phase, muscles can remain saturated with just a daily 3-5 gram maintenance dose. Narrator: Research indicates that if you don't want to do a loading phase, you don't have to in order to reap the benefits of creatine. It will just take approximately 28 days as opposed to 5-7 days to fully saturate your muscles with creatine. Narrator: In my husband's case, he wanted to see benefits from creatine sooner rather than later, so he took 20 grams of creatine for 5 days straight, then followed this loading phase with a daily maintenance dose of 5 grams. In my case, I wasn't in a rush, so I just took 5 grams daily for 28 days. "},{"question":"Rewrite these facts as a paragraph about the Moon that would be easy for a 2nd grader to understand.1.

Visitors came to see Dewey, and he had a book written about his life. Named after the Dewey Decimal System, Dewey remains the face of the Iowa Public Library System.2. Kuzya. Official Position: Assistant Librarian    Novorossiysk Library, Russia    In October 2012, a stray cat made his way to the Novorossiysk Public Library. He was an instant hit with the library staff and the patrons, and everyone wanted to keep him. But Kuzya didn't have his official papers, so the staff set about securing the required documents, including a cat passport for Kuzya. With his papers in order, Kuzya's first job was as the library's official greeter and afternoon napper, and more people began frequenting the library. He was soon promoted to his current position of Assistant Librarian, awarded a bow tie to wear, and received a well-deserved raise in cat food and treats. 3. Pages. Official Position: Library Greeter and Blogger    Valley Center Public Library, Valley Center, Kansas    The Valley Center Public Library got its beloved mascot when a stray wandered into the facility.

Two hours had passed, and he still hadn't gotten to the center of the first tootsie pop. His tongue began to seize up. The muscles in his face spasmed! He didn't know if he could go on much longer.

We encourage you to do the same!Our oldest boy, Mark, is excited to play center on the school’s basketball team. However, not quite as excited as he is to be working extra hours at WalMart to pay for my car after he crashed it. Don’t worry, though! Keep your cards and letters home, he and Ashley (his new girlfriend) are doing just fine. As a matter of fact, I think she got a job there, too, so they can spend even more waking moments together.We also couldn’t be prouder of our little fashionista, pink-haired Tina. She has landed a role in the current school play, Our Town. This is an amazement to all of us because previously, her favorite hobby was to scroll through social media while locked away in her room. Our Town, or even our house, was surely a mystery to her before the stage called.Our youngest, Bella, is our little entrepreneur. We are convinced she’s stashing her babysitting and dog-walking money away for something big. Will she buy us a new house? A new car? New siblings?

David’s bowling team squeaked out a near-loss and escaped a disastrous sip of beer out of a smelly bowling shoe by landing 6th out of 7th place. And, while he throws a shiny black ball down an alley, I’m taking our dogs for walks in the blinding snow and getting creative with home cooking.

A quantum physicist would say this is a “classical” implementation of computing. A “quantum” implementation of a computer manipulates quantum bits (qubits). Qubits can have a value of one, zero or both simultaneously. When the bit is simultaneously a one and a zero, the bit is said to be in a state of superposition. Moreover, the state of one qubit can influence another qubit, even if they are separated by great distance, in this case, the states are said to be entangled. Superposition and entanglement are at the heart of quantum computing and provide capabilities that can speed the types of calculation required for cryptanalysis from years to minutes.","answer":"A regular digital Computer uses bits to process tasks.

Nobody could have imagined that just a few months later they would be lifting the Stanley Cup trophy for the first time in franchise history. A season that started with frustration ended in glory, but how did it happen? When the Blues fired coach Mike Yeo after starting 7-9-3 in the first 19 games, hopes for a good season largely went down the drain. After that, it wasn't as if things improved immediately. The Blues named Craig Berube as interim coach and the team continued to stumble before bottoming out as the last-place team in the entire league. Nobody would have been surprised if the team, coaches, and fans threw in the towel on a disappointing season. But that never happened. Instead, the Blues went on one of the most improbable runs in sports history. And it all started with Jordan Binnington.After starting the year as the organization's 4th ranked goaltender, Binnington was given an opportunity to start for the team in mid-January. In his first three starts, Binnington allowed just two goals in his first three starts. With Binnington's stellar performance in net, the Blues slowly began to work their way back up the standings, finishing the season on a 30-10-5 run in their last 45 games. Binnington continued to impress during the playoffs, starting in goal for all 16 Blues wins, including an incredible performance in game 7 against both the Stars and Bruins.

This substance is not milk in the mammalian sense, but it serves a similar nutritional purpose.Pigeon milk is produced in the crop of both male and female adult pigeons, a region of the bird's esophagus used for food storage. Around the time the eggs are due to hatch, the cells lining the crop of the parent birds begin to proliferate and secrete a thick, nutritious substance, rich in proteins and fats, similar to mammalian milk.Unlike most birds, which typically feed their hatchlings with regurgitated food, pigeons feed their young this crop milk during the first week of their life. It's highly nutritious, containing more protein and fat than either cow or human milk, and it also contains antioxidants and immune-boosting proteins, which help protect the chick from disease."},{"question":"Create a five-word sentence.

This was upsetting news to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who, less than two weeks after the Pearl Harbor bombing, had urged non-Japanse Americans not to turn against Japanese Americans in her syndicated column, “My Day.”“We, as citizens, if we hear anything suspicious, will report it to the proper authorities,” she wrote in her December 16 column, acknowledging that the United States was at war with Japan, Germany and Italy. “But the great mass of our people, stemming from these various national ties, must not feel that they have suddenly ceased to be Americans.”As first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt could not and did not want to publicly disagree with her husband’s executive order. (Despite their disagreements, she was a fierce protector of FDR’s image and legacy.) Instead, she attempted to assist Japanese Americans who were in the camps, while publicly praising their loyalty and work ethic in order to convince other Americans that they were not a threat.By the fall of 1941, Eleanor Roosevelt knew that U.S.the United States entry into World War II was a possibility. And she worried about what that would mean for Japanese Americans. At the time, the United States still barred first-generation Japanese immigrants, known as Issei, from becoming citizens under the 1790 Naturalization Act. Second-generation Japanese Americans, known as Nisei, held U.S. citizenship because they were born in the United States. But this did not protect them from racism and discrimination.The first lady reached out to the Justice Department about what might happen to Japanese Americans in the event of war, writes Greg Robinson, a history professor at the University of Quebec in Montreal, in By Order of the President: FDR and the Internment of Japanese Americans. On December 4, 1941—three days before the Pearl Harbor attack—the first lady publicly stated that if the country entered the war, the government would not discriminate against any law-abiding noncitizens living in the United States.That proved very quickly to be untrue. After the U.S. declared war on Japan on December 8, the Treasury Department froze all assets of Issei residents. Eleanor intervened to convince the Treasury Department to relax the restrictions so that families could withdraw 100 a month. Over the next few months, prominent white Americans in the government and media began calling for something even more drastic: the “mass evacuation” of citizens and noncitizens of Japanese descent.The first lady was not immune to the anti-Japanese misinformation circulating among white Americans at the time. By January 1942, she believed incorrectly that the government had revealed some Japanese Americans to be spies. (In reality, the government never identified any ethnically Japanese spies living in the United States during the war.) Even so, she opposed the idea of mass evacuation.One of her allies within FDR’s administration was Attorney General Francis Biddle, who tried to advise the president against mass evacuation. But when it became clear that FDR was going to issue an executive order authorizing the forced removal and internment of Japanese Americans, Biddle declined to have the Justice Department intervene.Under Executive Order 9066, the United States forced more than 100,000 Japanese Americans out of their homes and into remote military internment camps. Each camp was surrounded by barbed wire and guard towers. When internees protested the unsafe conditions and inadequate food rations, military police often responded with violence.Publicly, Eleanor did not criticize this internment. Privately, she began corresponding with Japanese Americans in the camps. And she began advocating for a program to transfer Nisei students out of the camps so they could go to college. Her efforts led to the formation of the National Japanese American Student Relocation Council in May 1942. That year, she also asked the Department of War if she could visit one of the camps. They denied her request.When she asked again if she could visit a camp in early 1943, government officials were more amenable. By then, the Army had “opened up enlistment to Japanese American male volunteers, and Franklin Roosevelt endorsed their loyalty,” says Robinson in an interview with HISTORY.com. “He gave a public statement saying Americanism is a matter of the mind and the heart, and not of ancestry.”In April 1943—not long after Eleanor learned that the U.S. hadn’t actually discovered any Japanese Americans spies, as she had previously believed—the first lady made an approved public visit to the Gila River Relocation Center in Pinal County, Arizona. In her “My Day” column about the visit, she praised the internees as hard-working, law-abiding and loyal to the United States. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times published that month, she said that “the sooner we get the young Japanese out of the camps, the better.”","answer":"Question 1: What was the name of the column by former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt?

The Chelyabinsk Event - In 2013, this asteroid came into the Earth's atmosphere over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk. Thankfully, the asteroid exploded while it was 30 kilometers above the ground, and any direct impact damage was avoided. However, the explosion released the same amount of energy as 500 kilotons of TNT. Most of the injuries caused by this asteroid were caused by the shockwave from the explosion, which injured around 1,500 people and damaged 7,200 buildings.2. The Tunguska Event - In the year 1908, an asteroid or comet that was around 30 meters in diameter exploded above the ground in Tunguska, also in Russia. The explosion was so intense, that it knocked down close to 80 million trees that covered an area of 2,150 square kilometers. To put things in perspective, the explosion was so powerful, it's said to have been 1,000 times more powerful than the atomic bomb at Hiroshima. Luckily, the explosion did not happen in a city; otherwise, the city would have been destroyed. 3. The Chicxulub Event - The biggest asteroid to ever hit Earth was located in what is modern-day Mexico. 65 million years ago an asteroid between the size of 10 to 15 kilometers struck Earth and effectively wiped out 70% of all species on Earth, notably the dinosaurs. The asteroid was responsible for creating mega-tsunamis that reached southeastern Mexico all the way to Texas and Florida.

Hydrogen can form covalent bonds with electron-loving atoms like nitrogen, fluorine and oxygen. In a covalent bond between hydrogen and oxygen (for example in water molecules), the electron-loving Oxygen has a greater attraction to the electrons in the bond and this gives it a negative charge. Hydrogen is thus left with a positive charge. This separation of charge in a hydrogen bond makes it polar. The presence of hydrogen bonds in a water molecule is important because it makes water cohesive and sticks together and forms drops. Hydrogen bonds also make water molecules adhesive and they stick incredibly well to other surfaces.

While there are more than three groups, let's discuss three of them: Sporting, Working, and Toy groups.-Sporting dogs include breeds such as Retrievers, Spaniels, Pointers, and Setters. These dogs were historically bred for hunting and other field activities. They are known for their superior instincts in water and woods, and many of these breeds enjoy hunting, swimming, and retrieving games. They are generally very active and fun-loving animals, requiring regular, invigorating exercise.-Working dogs comprise breeds like Boxers, Siberian Huskies, Saint Bernards, and Great Danes. They were originally bred to perform jobs such as guarding property, pulling sleds, and performing water rescues. This group is known for their intelligence and versatility. Due to their size and strength, early training and socialization are essential to manage these breeds effectively.-The Toy group, as the name suggests, contains the smallest breeds of dogs such as Chihuahuas, Pomeranians, and Yorkshire Terriers. Despite their small size, these dogs were bred for various reasons, ranging from companionship to vermin hunting. They are well-suited to apartment living and make excellent companion pets. While they may require less exercise than larger breeds, they are often full of energy and personality."},{"question":"Write a story about a person who could see 1 minute into the future and the things she did, how she earned money and gave it back","answer":"Sarah was a fairly ordinary 32-year-old from Vermont. But she hid a secret that she kept to her grave. She swore to herself never to tell anyone. After all, she didn't want to end up as a science experiment in a lab. She could see up to a minute into the future and it was always accurate. Depending on the circumstance, she could change the outcome more than not.Sarah's first big breakthrough with her gift was when she sensed that her grandmother was about to fall. She didn't know what was going to happen, but at 86, a broken femur or other critical bone would end her life in a hurry. Sarah opened her car door and charged onto the scene as fast as she could. Her grandmother was navigating up her mobile home steps and was on the first step. Sarah ran to catch her as her grandmother's foot slipped on the third step. Sarah lunged forward, saving her grandmother from an otherwise potentially fatal accident. Knowing this gift, Sarah became deeply involved in the stock market and enjoyed gambling. The #1 rule she told herself was to never take more than would be reasonable and never be suspicious. She wanted to use her gift to help others. She'd go to the roulette wheel and play her odds. She'd drop chips on the 2, 4, and 9, knowing they weren't going to gain anything. But the 14 was going to be the winner. In an hour, she'd come in with 100 and walk away with 1,800. The dealers shrugged it off as a lucky evening. But a 1,700 profit in an hour was nothing to scoff at. To diversify, she also experimented with some trading with stocks and options. It was scary how much money she could make. She severely limited her earnings to keep under the radar from the SEC.By the time she was 50, she had earned 19 million in profits, mostly from gambling and trading. She gave most of it back anonymously to her family, friends, community, and those in need.

Give me a list of 5 things I need to do when preparing for a road trip.","answer":"Check all fluids. This means oil, coolant in the radiator, brake fluid, and even transmission fluid if it is not sealed. Your vehicle user guide should have the relevant information as far as how much fluids need to be added and at what interval. You can also ask your favorite auto mechanic to check these items out for you, but be diligent and be prepared to pay more to have someone else do it.Check your tire pressure. Keeping your tires inflated to their recommended pressure will help ensure a safe and smooth ride. Most tires have a max pressure number printed on the sidewall of the tire. Do NOT inflate to this number, it is the MAXIMUM amount of air the tire can take. Instead, there should be a label on the inside of your vehicle door that has the recommended tire pressure listed on it.Clean your mirrors and windows. You might want to do this just for aesthetic reasons, but having clean windows and mirrors can also keep you safe on the road. Use a streak-free cleaner and lint-free cloth. Non-glossy newspaper works very well for cleaning windows without leaving streak lines. Have a road safety kit. It should include a flashlight, jumper cables, a cone or reflective triangle, and some gloves in case of poor weather. Check your spare tire and jack if so equipped. If you don’t have one, get a can or two of Fix-A-Flat. It may get you somewhere safe in case of a flat."},{"question":"Assign this article as \\"engaging\\" or not and explain why in 2 sentences. “Seven years ago, we never bought rice from China. Today, my parents have to depend on my paycheck to buy bags of rice to supplement the little rice that we can grow here.” Kemo Fatty comes from a family of farmers living on the north bank of the Gambia river. For generations, they had grown everything they needed on the region’s fertile floodplains. But in recent years, climate change and deforestation have made the region nearly uncultivable. As there isn’t enough rainwater washing down the river, saltwater from the sea moves upstream and destroys crops. And because of the lack of trees, the soil has lost all its nutrients, and crops don’t grow.Like everywhere in the Sahel – the 3 million sq km region between the Sahara desert and the African rainforest – the Gambia is on the frontline of climate change. “It’s a race against water,” says Fatty. “Water is the real commodity here. We are losing more and more water, which is making people poorer and poorer.”Over the past few decades, the Sahel’s natural resources have dwindled, leading to a loss of biodiversity, poverty, mass emigration, violence and food insecurity, in a region where most people rely on agriculture for subsistence – 60% live in rural areas.Temperatures in the Sahel are expected to rise 1.5 times faster than in the rest of the world, and could reach up to five degrees celsius above pre-industrial times. That would make the region uninhabitable. Yet the Gambia is only responsible for 0.05% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to a UN FCCC paper published in 2016.“It has become personal now, because we see first-hand that we are a helpless nation,” says Fatty. His own brother is among the many young people who have left the country to seek better opportunities in Europe, hoping to be able to help their families from abroad. “These are not economic migrants, they are climate migrants. Because the climate is affecting the economic power of our state.”Fatty stayed. Just 28 years old, he is now the executive director of Green Up Gambia, an NGO helping rural communities mitigate and adapt to climate change, and has recently joined Civic, a UK-based social enterprise working to drive positive change around the world, as head of community engagement. With both organisations, he’s working on a mammoth project: Africa’s Great Green Wall.","answer":"I would assign this article as “engaging” because it effectively tells a personal story of how climate change is affecting people’s lives in the Sahel region.

Write it in the style of Kevin Smith or Grant Morrison.","answer":"Clay eventually stopped cowering, slowly unfolding himself from his fetal position on the ground. The sound of crashing metal and exploding pavement quickly faded into the sound of smoldering. A brilliant green light cast itself from behind the now-ruined mailbox, shreds of former letters and packages smoking on the ground and floating slowly down on a gust of wind. Pulling himself back up to a standing position and checking to make sure that no one saw his temporary cowardice, the young man slowly crept up on the glow, a small voice in the back of his mind worrying at him about radiation and Marie Curie. Instead, what looked like a square plastic (or maybe ceramic? or steel?) container sat in the remains of the mailbox, nearly cracked in two, the green light spilling out. \\"If it's radioactive, then I'm already boned,\\" he mused, ignoring the nagging, fearful voice of \\"reason.\\"A small green ring. Neat. Like one of those Green Lantern ones. Is it a Power Ring? \\"There's no way. Literally no way,\\" he thought, followed by, \\"Stop saying literally all the time.

See you soon.\\" The image fades, leaving the real world, and a quickly approaching Green Lantern sporting bright red sidecut hair, for poor Clay to consider."},{"question":"Summarize this article about Thespis, leaving enough information so I can sound like I know what I am talking about when his name comes up in class.Thespis of Icaria is considered to be the first actor in the theatre. The English word “thespian,” which means actor, is derived from his name. Along with being an actor on the Ancient Greek stage, Thespis was also a celebrated playwright, stage director and producer. None of his plays are extant.His innovations included connecting the chorus directly to the plot, developing the idea of the power of the protagonist in drama and replacing cruder dithyrambic makeup with more refined linen masks to delineate character.Aristotle’s TakeAccording to Aristotle, Thespis transformed the presentation of stories forever by emerging from the Greek chorus and acting an individual role. Greek tragedy is said to have been descendent from dithyrambic poetry, which were the choral presentations of Greek myth that included movement.With Thespis, the chorus remained playing its role, while the first actor played various roles by switching masks. Greek tragedy would not add another principal actor to the stage until some 50 years later in the fifth century when playwright/actor Aeschylus first wrote tragedies to be performed by two actors and a chorus.Pisistratus’ Command PerformanceWhen the head of state requests something, you do it. After Athenian military man and tyrant Pisistratus came to power in 560 BC, he instituted many artistic and cultural innovations. One thing he did was he expanded the offerings at the City of Dionysia by having plays performed. It’s said that Pisistratus asked Thespis and his troupe to perform in that initial drama festival in 534 BCE. Thespis did, and he won the first prize for best tragedy.Solon’s CriticismAccording to Plutarch, Athenian lawmaker and leader Solon went to see Thespis perform. It’s noted by Plutarch that this was when Thespis had first started acting and tragedy was a new form.Solon was elderly and living a leisurely life and in addressing Thespis after his performance he asked, “if he was not ashamed to tell so many lies before such a number of people; and Thespis replying that it was no harm to say or do so in a play, Solon vehemently struck his staff against the ground: ‘Ah,” he said, ‘if we honor and commend such play as this, we shall find it some day in our business.’”That’s the first recorded criticism of an actor that we have on hand, and it was made, ironically, by a politician.Thespis Center StageAlthough we’ll never know if Thespis was the first actor on the stage, we are more certain that he was the first actor in scripted drama to appear on the Athenian stage. However, we can’t even be certain about this.We do know that Thespis won first prize in 534 BC for best tragedy in the initial City of Dionysia festival and that he was influential enough to be written about by Aristotle in The Poetics, which is the first document we possess focusing on dramatic criticism. Whether or not he was actually the first actor on the stage doesn’t matter; Thespis was influential enough to be considered a groundbreaking force in the Ancient Greek theatre.","answer":"In English, the word for actor, “thespian”, comes from the name of the person credited with being the first actor, Thespis of Icaria. A famous playwright (none extant), stage director and producer of ancient Greece, Thespis' most important theatrical innovation was to step out from the chorus to play an individual role. Previously, productions had consisted of the chorus presenting in unison Greek myths by using voice and movement. Thespis retained the chorus’ role while switching masks to represent a single lead character. It would take an additional 50 years for playwright Aeschylus to introduce a second actor. We know with certainty that Thespis won first prize in the City of Dionysia in 534 BCE and was influential enough to be written about by Aristotle in his work, The Poetics."},{"question":"Write 5-7 tweets for an account run by the park from the movies Jurassic Park and Jurassic World.

Morning Munchies: Skipping breakfast might save you some time, but it won't save you any pounds. Eating a balanced breakfast jumpstarts your metabolism and keeps cravings at bay, preventing you from overeating later on. 2. Toss the Treats: Stocking up on junk food is like inviting temptation to take control of your body. Remove the trigger foods and replace them with healthy snacks like fruits, nuts, or veggies.3. Stay Hydrated: Water work wonders! We quickly mistake thirst for hunger. Always keep a reusable water bottle and sip it away whenever you feel like it.4. Fiber is Your True Friend: High fiber means you’ll feel fuller for a long time. For weight loss, it means you’ll avoid overeating. Try vegetables and whole grains. Choose a quick, nutrient-dense option like a smoothie bowl or whole-grain toast with avocado. 5. Fruits and veggies: Good for your health, great for your waistline. Include them in every meal, swap your snacks for fruit, and make them the star of your plate.6. Three square meals: Skipping meals will leave you hungry and more likely to overeat. Stick to regular meal times, and balance your plate with a variety of healthy foods.7. Break a sweat: Get moving! Take a daily walk, a dance class, or something more intense. Being active will burn calories and boost your metabolism way faster.8. Label language: Learn to decipher food labels to make informed choices. Beware of hidden sugars, salts, and unhealthy fats.

Mom, Dad, and their two young children all excitedly climbed in the car to head on their way. Dad explained that this was a different type of restaurant called a dim sum restaurant. Instead of ordering from a waitress and having one big plate of food prepared back in the kitchen, at dim sum, you order a variety of bite-sized Chinese dishes.

The goal of this paragraph should be to introduce the rest of the article that would be written afterward.","answer":"Originating in the fires of World War II, the Manhattan Project is one of the most morally confusing science projects in human history. The Manhattan Project refers to the United States' research and development of a functional atomic bomb. While it was named the Manhattan Project, most of the work took place in New Mexico, not New York. As most know, the atomic bomb was eventually used twice in Japan, destroying cities and causing massive casualties to the Japanese population. The US had been forced into the war following Pearl Harbor and needed a way to bring a swift end to the war in Japan. The project began originally due to fears that German scientists had been experimenting with nuclear weaponry since the early 1930s. The U.S. began research as a countermeasure to provide some defense against this technology. However, the United States finished the project first and in doing so changed the tide of the war and human history as a whole. This article will discuss the project itself, its impact on human history as a whole, and the morality of the destructive weapon."},{"question":"Summarize the different purposes tails serve in the animal world in a bulleted list.Tails serve different purposes for different groups of animals, and animals with tails have evolved structures and behaviors to maximize this part of their body. For example, insect tails serve as stingers, dispensers of chemical weapons, egg depositors, whips, and flight stabilizers, among many other uses. In vertebrates, tails are primarily designed for locomotion and balance. For example, the tails of fishes and crocodiles sweep back and forth propelling these animals forward in the water. Tails also serve as energy stores and disposable parts: skinks and many other lizard species can voluntarily release their tail when a predator chomps onto it, and they can regenerate their tails later. The largest sauropod dinosaurs (that is, the ones that walked on four legs) had long tails to balance the weight of their long necks. A bird’s tail works together with its wings to help the bird from falling out of the sky, and the colorful tail feathers of male birds of paradise, turkeys, peacocks, and others help to attract females. Some mammals, such as squirrels and some monkeys, use their tail as grasping limbs to maneuver through the trees.","answer":"- Insect tails are used as stingers, chemical weapon dispensers, egg depositors, whips, and flight stabilizers.- Vertebrate tails are used for locomotion and balance.- Dinosaur tails are used to balance the weight of their long necks.- Bird tails are used to work along with wings to help them stay in the sky when flying.- Male bird tails are used to attract a mate with colorful feathers.- Some mammal tails are used as grasping limbs when climbing trees."},{"question":"How many moon phases are there?

The study of over 4,700 teens ages 14 to 17 in nine countries found a correlation between atheism/agnosticism/spiritual uncertainty, heavy use of social media and destructive thoughts. Specifically, “rates of destructive thoughts are more common among teens who express that they don’t believe in anything spiritual, are uncertain about their beliefs, or believe they sin, but don’t believe in Jesus,” the study found.The study by the Center for Bible Engagement at Back to the Bible in partnership with Our Daily Bread Ministries called itself “one of the first studies to consider the relationships among spirituality, social media, and mental health.” Destructive thoughts are a risk factor for suicidality, the study noted. Destructive thoughts are more common among teens who, for example, endorse such beliefs as “I have no need for God,” “I’m spiritual, but don’t believe in God,” “God does not exist” and “there is no afterlife when we die.” By comparison, teens who are engaged with the Bible are significantly less likely to have destructive thoughts, according to the study. The study found that the “high suicide risk” among teens was linked to their “spiritual beliefs and social media experience,” according to the Center for Bible Engagement.Teens who live in the United States and the United Kingdom are more likely than teens in other countries to experience destructive thoughts, the study said. “As one of the first studies to consider the relationships among spirituality, social media, and mental health, the data deepened our understanding of the inner world of today’s teens,” said Arnie Cole, director of research and development at the Center for Bible Engagement. “We also provide some beginning evidence of factors that increase or lower their risk of destructive thoughts including engaging the Bible and limiting social media usage. Our goal is to develop with our partners a suite of Bible engagement/spiritual growth tools that include a teen spiritual fitness assessment that could predict self-destructive behavior ranging from suicide to homicide.

I never used to like it when I was younger, but as I get older I find myself enjoying running immensely. Running becomes a great form of moving meditation that also serves as a fantastic workout. But I wasn't born with the ability to run, I had to learn how to run. Yes, running is pretty simple, but efficiency in running is something that requires a lot of practice. Here's what I have noticed in the years since I started running that has helped me to improve:1. Start low, and work your way up - I started running based on time, rather than distance. My beginner's routine was a mix of running and walking, made up of 60- to 90-second runs interspersed with 60-second rest periods over 7 or 8 cycles. As I ran longer minutes, I was gaining more distance, and after some time I was able to switch to distance running where I would run based on how far I wanted to go.2. Low and slow is the key - running slowly and ensuring I got my running form correct were keys to my improvements in running. Low-impact running, not going all-out trying to break records or push my body unnecessarily, helped me to build on my weekly mileage.3. Relax and breathe - relaxing your body during a run is important to conserving energy over long distances. Also, learning to breathe while running (such as cadenced breathing or breathing with a certain tempo) helps to ensure you're getting enough air into your lungs while still being able to work your body.4. Finding the zone - when I run, I am sometimes able to reach a specific \\"zone,\\" where I am running and not expending much energy, yet I am still getting a workout. It feels like being on autopilot, where my body can act accordingly while my mind can meditate on things like my surroundings, the music I'm listening to, or whatever I want to think about that day. This zone takes time to reach because it requires training the body to reach a certain level of fitness before you can be comfortable with running multiple miles and not being tired. But once you've reached it, it will feel like you're gliding effortlessly."},{"question":"Write an email explaining why it could be bad to drink caffeine and how to cope with losing it.","answer":"Hey Zac, I heard you were struggling to keep your head up at the seminar today. I also saw that big can of Red Mouse on your desk. Have you considered quitting caffeine?I know it's normal to drink it, but oddly enough it could be causing your sleepiness. See, caffeine found in coffee, energy drinks, and even tea acts as a central nervous system stimulant. That makes you feel more awake, but when you tunnel down into what's really happening, it's kind of scary. It boosts stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline that you'd get from entering a fight-or-flight state. I know sometimes we all get passionate about fighting for the protection of beaver dams but getting worked up could make it harder to have a fiery speech when it comes time to pitch the group's values.It's just dulling your ability to feel tired, so that's what leads to crashing. You're still tired, you just don't realize it.Remember, you talk about side effects all the time! That was your argument that saved the Big Stick Highway in Vermont! If you think about it, caffeine can make you nervous and it can make it harder to sleep. Plus, it can dehydrate you which is rough especially when we do summer protests.If you want to switch, I recommend gradually tapering off to avoid headaches.

Becoming an artist means contributing your creativity to the world.2. No one has the same ideas that you do. Two people can paint the same still life, and their paintings will still be unique because they interpreted the source differently. It's important to share YOUR vision because nobody else can.3. While it's true that not every artist signs a million-dollar contract in a month, not every artist works for pennies, either. Plenty of artists make a liveable income or at least supplement their paychecks.4. The Internet has made it easier than ever for artists to find work. You can jump on Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok and potentially earn thousands of followers. Artists also join Patreon, which allows their fans to fund their work in exchange for requests, sketches, and exclusive pieces.5. If you don't act now, you might spend the rest of your life wondering why you didn't take the risk. It's better to try and potentially not succeed than never try at all."},{"question":"Change the facts presented in this text into a series of questions and answers.Bilbo celebrates his eleventy-first (111th) birthday and leaves the Shire suddenly, passing the Ring to Frodo Baggins, his cousin[d] and heir. Neither hobbit is aware of the Ring's origin, but the wizard Gandalf suspects it is a Ring of Power. Seventeen years later, in \\"The Shadow of the Past\\", Gandalf tells Frodo that he has confirmed that the Ring is the one lost by the Dark Lord Sauron long ago and counsels him to take it away from the Shire. Gandalf leaves, promising to return by Frodo's birthday and accompany him on his journey, but fails to do so.Frodo sets out on foot, offering a cover story of moving to Crickhollow, accompanied by his gardener Sam Gamgee and his cousin Pippin Took. They are pursued by mysterious Black Riders, but meet a passing group of Elves led by Gildor Inglorion, whose chants to Elbereth ward off the Riders. The hobbits spend the night with them, then take an evasive short cut the next day, and arrive at the farm of Farmer Maggot, who takes them to Bucklebury Ferry, where they meet their friend Merry Brandybuck. When they reach the house at Crickhollow, Merry and Pippin reveal they know about the Ring and insist on travelling with Frodo and Sam.They decide to try to shake off the Black Riders by cutting through the Old Forest. Merry and Pippin are trapped by Old Man Willow, an ancient tree who controls much of the forest, but are rescued by Tom Bombadil. Leaving the refuge of Tom's house, they get lost in a fog and are caught by a barrow-wight in a barrow on the downs, but Frodo, awakening from the barrow-wight's spell, calls Tom Bombadil, who frees them, and equips them with ancient swords from the barrow-wight's hoard.The hobbits reach the village of Bree, where they encounter a Ranger named Strider. The innkeeper gives Frodo a letter from Gandalf written three months before which identifies Strider as a friend. Knowing the riders will attempt to seize the party, Strider guides the hobbits through the wilderness toward the Elven sanctuary of Rivendell. On the way, the group stops at the hill Weathertop. While at Weathertop, they are again attacked by five of the nine Black Riders. During the struggle, their leader wounds Frodo with a cursed blade. After fighting them off, Strider treats Frodo with the herb athelas, and is joined by the Elf Glorfindel who has been searching for the party. Glorfindel rides with Frodo, now deathly ill, toward Rivendell. The Black Riders nearly capture Frodo at the Ford of Bruinen, but upon attempting to cross the ford, flood waters summoned by Elrond rise up and overwhelm them.","answer":"Question: Who celebrates their eleventy-first birthday and leaves the Shire suddenly, passing the Ring to Frodo Baggins?Answer: Bilbo Baggins.Question: Who suspects the Ring is a Ring of Power?Answer: The wizard Gandalf.Question: How many years later does Gandalf tell Frodo that he has confirmed that the Ring is the one lost by the Dark Lord Sauron long ago?Answer: Seventeen years.Question: What do the hobbits do when they reach the house at Crickhollow?Answer: Merry and Pippin reveal they know about the Ring and insist on traveling with Frodo and Sam.Question: What does Tom Bombadil do for the hobbits after rescuing them?Answer: He frees them, and equips them with ancient swords from the barrow-wight's hoard.Question: Who do the hobbits encounter in Bree?Answer: A Ranger named Strider.Question: Where do the hobbits stop on their way to Rivendell?Answer: At Weathertop.Question: Who do the hobbits encounter again while they are at Weathertop?Answer: Five of the nine Black Riders.Question: Who nearly capture Frodo at the Ford of Bruinen?Answer: The Black Riders.Question: Who summons flood waters that overwhelm the Black Riders at the Ford of Bruinen?Answer: Elrond."},{"question":"Sum up what this says about mustard donuts.

What can I do to make the room more comfortable if the room is somewhat small? Please give me 5 suggestions.","answer":"Decorating a small room can seem daunting, but with the right accessories and approach, you can make your small room feel cozy and comfortable. Here are 5 ways you can accomplish this:1. Use mirrors - Mirrors give a perception of depth to a room, making it appear larger than it truly is. Consider putting up a mirror or two in strategic places in your room that fit in with your overall design.2. Plants - Houseplants (either real or fake) can add a certain level of charm and a tropical feel to your room. Put a houseplant in an open corner of the room or hang it from the ceiling. Bonus points for fake plants, as upkeep is minimal since they do not need to be watered.3. Accessories with dual purposes - To keep clutter to a minimum, use furniture that can have dual purposes. For instance, having a nightstand with drawers near your bed can act as a table for you to put a lamp on as well as a storage area for small things like books or other knickknacks that would otherwise go on the top of the nightstand and clutter that area. Or, use rolling storage bins that can fit under your bed to store excess clothing and other items to free up much-needed space in your closet.4. Make use of lighting - Use lighting to set the mood in your room. Soft lighting can add a sense of intimacy, while bright lights can cause you to feel alert and active. You could use color-changing lights that can do both types of lighting, or you can have dedicated lighting (such as LED light strips) as accents in certain areas of your room.5. Put up pictures - Consider decorating your empty walls with still-life pictures or paintings. Having an empty wall can make a room feel less cozy, but putting up some pictures will give you something to look at."},{"question":"Write a poem about a cardinal feeding at a birdfeeder.

Some of them may have more or less evidence for beneficial effects in normal people as well.[citation needed]HypertensionA low sodium diet is beneficial for people with high blood pressure. A Cochrane review published in 2008 concluded that a long-term (more than four weeks) low sodium diet usefully lowers blood pressure, both in people with hypertension (high blood pressure) and in those with normal blood pressure.[30]The DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) is a diet promoted by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (part of the NIH, a United States government organization) to control hypertension.

Choose one example from each and go into detail about the concept or theorem and its impact.","answer":"Sure! I would be happy to go into detail about three famous concepts in statistics, mathematics, and physics!1. The Invention of Calculus - Isaac Newton invented the concept of calculus in 1665. Although calculus has uses in physics, biology, economics, engineering, chemistry, and more, its most common association is with mathematics. Calculus is about studying the rate of change over time. Differential calculus can be compared to algebra. Calculus is used to define the slope of the curve, while algebra is more focused on straight lines. Integral calculus is used when the area under a graph needs to be calculated. It can break a sloped line into smaller segments to solve a problem that algebra can't.Isaac Newton found that when trying to describe the speed of a falling object, the speed increased every second, although no mathematical solution explained why at the time. He found the explanation through calculus and used the same formula to explain the orbits of the sun, moon, and other planets. There are many uses for calculus today: it is heavily tied into all aspects of engineering, it can be used when data is being collected and analyzed, and, of course, it is still taught in various forms at the high school and, more typically, college level. Its invention also allowed for other scientific theories to come after it, such as the theory of relativity.2. The Theory of Relativity - Widely known as the most famous theory in all of physics, the theory was invented by Albert Einstein. He had published a paper ten years earlier than his more famous theory about \\"special relativity,\\" which explained space and time, but the theory did not address gravity. Einstein's theory expanded upon Newton's by determining the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers. He also showed the speed of light on its own is the same no matter what speed the observer is traveling. Equations for this theory also prove that massive objects distort spacetime. Light bends around massive objects like black holes, allowing it to act as a lens for things that are behind it; this is used by scientists to observe stars. Another aspect of the theory of relativity that is widely known is its direct impact on allowing the invention of the atomic bomb. Einstein was around during its creation but did not directly work on it himself, instead warning about the potential of its possible impact.3. Normal Distribution - One of the most common concepts in statistics, also known as the Bell Curve, normal distribution affects many parts of our everyday lives. It explains various distributions such as the heights of the general public, errors in measurement, blood pressure, marks on a test, and intelligence of the populace, just to name a few examples. Related to the normal distribution is the standard deviation; the highest number of examples occur right in the middle of the graph, while standard deviations to the left and right are much less common. Typically two standard deviations away from the mean are rare, while three or more are exceedingly rare. This explains things like why there are so few extremely intelligent people. The probability of distribution means the odds of it happening are very unlikely, all factors considered."},{"question":"Uh, yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.

Music: 10 is a good age to learn how to play a musical instrument. Enroll your child in lessons, or ask him if he would like to join his school band.4. Sports:  Physical activity is good for children. There are all kinds of sports teams that kids can join. See what is available in your area, and ask your son if he is interested in joining. 5. Cooking: Some kids like to learn basic cooking skills as they get older. He might want to bake a cake and ice it, or prepare simple meals for the family.

I was late! So I had to wait 20 minutes for the next one. Once I actually got on my train, guess what?! My wireless headphones were dead! So I had to sit on the train and let my thoughts wander for about an hour and 10 minutes. Once I finally got off the subway train and got above ground, I came to find out now it was raining. So after I walked for about 10 minutes in the rain and I finally got to work, somehow, some way, it only proceeded to get worse! About an hour into my shift, my manager asked me to come to the back so she could speak with me. Her tone alone told me that it wasn’t going to be good. She went on for a bit about how she thought I was a good person and hard worker but that I wasn’t going to be a good fit for the business and that she would have to let me go.

Trees burst into red and gold, leaves giving up the emerald of summer, quivering against sudden bursts of icy air. The wind is full of authority, directing every corner of the forest that presses covetously against the flimsy links of chain or strips of weathered pine protecting backyards. The fences will win for a moment, as trunks are laid bare, limbs pausing as they turn their energy inward, mimicking slumber to prepare for winter. Chipmunks are ghostly shadows of stripe and fur, racing with purpose, to and fro, back and forth, up and down, cheeks filled with mysterious things, as if they are travelers making one last check before disappearing into vacation homes to wait out the gray days and the creeping, heaving frost so powerful that it sometimes buckles country roads.Autumn practices sleight of hand, offering up the warmest artist’s palette of fiery color tones, designed to distract, soothe, and hypnotize the living. Tourists crowd along the twisted lanes, gripping cameras and smartphones, paying witness to the cacophony of the season change through tempered squares of glass. Soon, they will retreat back into shored-up cities, behind heavy walls, and technology that forgets it is no match for Winter until the electric grids sputter and fail, silenced by the Northeastern winds."},{"question":"Write a 3-paragraph blurb about why labradors make good pets.

I like swimming too, so anytime you want to take me somewhere where I can get in the water is a perfect day in my book. I'm usually in a good mood and I mostly just want to spend time with my people - I would love to go to work with you or lay at your feet all day if you work from home. I really like kids too - they are so FUN to play with! Sometimes I have to be careful because I'm bigger than them and I might accidentally knock them over. I get so excited that it makes me wiggle around and jump and that's too much for some little kids. You might have to help me by reminding me to be gentle with them. Thank you so much. I really just want to make you happy but it's so hard sometimes because I get distracted when I'm excited. I don't want to brag but I'm also pretty smart. I can learn lots of tricks and I'm actually happier when you give me rules to obey and teach me how to do new things. I love making new friends - I would make new friends every day if I could.

Write an email to Kentucky Fried Chicken requesting in a logical fashion that they switch to selling a different meat.","answer":"To whom it may concern:I am writing in protest of decades of your company's sole focus on one protein group:  chicken.When Colonel Sanders started your company, he clearly had a bias against fowl. What else could explain his decision to single out chicken protein while overlooking valuable other meats like beef and pork from his restaurant's menu? Seafood is also an excellent protein source. Some consider snails a delicacy!The truth of the matter is that the public perception of chickens has been changing in recent years. You can now find beautiful specimens of my species adorning dishtowels, metal signs, and wall decor. Some clearly enlightened people adopt chickens as part of their families, even dressing them in trendy outfits and accessories. Elaborate coop designs are available online for owners who want to keep their highly-esteemed chickens living a life of luxury.When making decisions about which species to feature on your menu, KFC is not taking into account the generous contributions cows make to the proper fertilization of the soil. Protecting the environment is a top-of-mind issue for many consumers, and just imagine the goodwill it could garner from your company switching to farming cows!And let's take a look at pork. Pigs will eat almost any kind of food waste you provide. They aren't particular. You could give them the prior day's leftover mashed potatoes and coleslaw and they'd be, well, as happy as pigs! Pork lends itself to some tasty menu variations, like pickled pigs' feet and pig snouts. In fact, doesn't \\"Kentucky Fried Pig Snouts\\" have a ring to it? Plus, there's an added benefit to switching to pig protein:  dogs love to eat pigs' ears, and that would offer you an avenue into a completely new market.Other proteins have positive selling points, too. Fish can be farmed in ponds capable of containing many fish in a relatively small footprint of real estate. Dig the pond as deep as you'd like. And think about how little space it would take to raise snails!In closing, I believe Kentucky Fried Chicken needs to revisit its antiquated business practice of selling chicken. There are other wonderful protein substitutes available that are more earth-friendly, offer added revenue streams, and offer a more efficient use of space.Respectfully,[Chicken Name]"},{"question":"Write one paragraph about a character that follows the rules but is not cut out to be a leader the way he is needed to be.

The reason for their extinction is not necessarily known, as it is difficult for scientists to determine the exact cause of an extinction that happened pre-historically. However, scientists do have some theories about why the Neanderthals went extinct. The main theory is that a combination of climate change and increased competition from other species brought the Neanderthals to their end. Neanderthals were highly specialized for cold environments. While these specializations were advantageous during the Ice Age, they are thought to have caused Neanderthals to be unfit for the warming environment that they began to face about 45,000 years ago. Homo Sapiens, on the other hand, had much more adaptability to these changes and were fierce competition for vital resources at the time.This is considered to be the main theory behind Neanderthal extinction. However, scientists have offered more ideas on the subject. Our understanding of the topic may change as scientists continue to study human evolution and discover more information.

This technique provides direct experimental feedback for modeling the complexity of biological interactions.Localization microscopy works on the principle that the diffraction barrier (the resolution limit of light waves) can be bypassed by photoswitching, photoactivation, or photoconversion of individual fluorophores, which are attached to the structure of interest.","answer":"Localization microscopy is a new technique that helps us understand how cells work at a microscopic level.

Try to keep the summary to 5 sentences or fewer.It’s been 15 years since the release of Toy Story. Woody, Buzz Lightyear and the rest of Andy’s toys have become indelible parts of our movie-going culture, much like Mickey Mouse, Cinderella and Snow White. Ever since that big hit in 1995, Pixar has put out one quality film after another, including most recent masterpieces WALL-E and Up. But while those two films introduced new worlds and characters, the creators of Toy Story 3 faced the immense challenge of not only living up to the quality of the previous two installments in the series, but not desecrating those beloved characters by delivering a limp third part to the trilogy.I am happy to report that Toy Story 3 is not only one of Pixar’s best films, but perhaps the best of the Toy Story trilogy. Returning to the familiar themes, mainly the feelings of insecurity and obsolesce that come with the passage of time, Toy Story 3 picks up years after the second part. Andy is now ready to head off to college and Woody and friends are déclassé, relegated to a toy chest. But when a horrible mistake almost sends the gang off to the garbage dump, Buzz Lightyear makes a decision that re-routes the toys to a daycare center with the hope that someone will play with them. Unfortunately, a mafia of toys already rules this daycare and a plush teddy bear named Lotso (Ned Beatty) and a Ken doll (Michael Keaton) conspire to banish Andy’s toys to the infant classroom, a fate worse than death. Naturally, it is up to Woody to save them.Even though Toy Story 3 hews to a similar format of the previous installment, that doesn’t mean it lacks thrills, laughs, excitement and peril. Essentially a prison break film, Toy Story 3 also makes knowing references to film noir, Westerns and numerous other filmic tropes. Pixar has always made movies that can be appreciated on many levels, and this one is no exception. ","answer":"Here is the summary you asked for.Toy Story 3 faced the difficult challenge of maintaining the quality featured in the first two films, but it succeeds in that challenge. Toy Story 3 is one of Pixar's best films and one of the best installments in the Toy Story series. The film takes place with Andy heading to college, where his classic childhood toys are mistakenly sent to a garbage dump before Buzz reroutes them to a local daycare. They find out that the daycare is run by what amounts to a toy mafia headed by Lotso, a toy bear. The toys must find a way to survive being sent to the infant room and escape their way from the daycare. This movie takes its inspiration from many genres of film including film noir, westerns and more."},{"question":"Can you write a Python function that takes two functions as an input and returns a function that returns the output of the first function when given the output of the second function?","answer":"Sure.

However, avoid overwatering and over-fertilization, as it increases the risk of fungal disease. If you amend your soil with compost, additional fertilizer isn't usually necessary for perennial salvias. In poor soils or for annual salvia varieties, use slow-release fertilizer when planting. There are over 900 species of salvia, so be sure to check the zone for your plants to know whether or not they're cold-hardy. With proper care, salvia plants will produce an abundance of colorful, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators and add beauty to any garden."},{"question":"Summarize the text provided below and use this article to answer the question, \\"Do poppy seeds affect drug tests?\\"Do poppy seeds affect drug tests?Poppy seeds don’t have nearly enough opiates to intoxicate you. But because drug tests are exquisitely sensitive, consuming certain poppy seed food products can lead to positive urine drug test results for opiates – specifically for morphine, codeine or both.Under most circumstances, opiate concentrations in the urine are too low to produce a positive test result. But certain food products – and it’s generally impossible to know which ones, because opiate content does not appear on food labels – contain enough opiates to produce positive test results. Moreover, because of overlap in opiate concentrations and morphine-to-codeine ratios, it can sometimes be challenging to distinguish test results that are due to the consumption of poppy seeds from those that are due to the use of opiate drugs.This is not a problem with most workplace drug testing. Test results are reviewed by a specially trained physician called a medical review officer. Unless the physician finds evidence of unauthorized opiate use, such as needle marks or signs of opiate intoxication or withdrawal, even relatively high concentrations of opiates in the urine that produce positive test results are generally ruled to be negative.It turns out, though, that drug testing in the military is different, and poppy seeds pose potential problems. One such problem, as highlighted in recent news reports, concerns service members who test positive for codeine and assert a “poppy seed defense.” They are still regarded as having taken codeine, sometimes with serious consequences, such as a disciplinary action or discharge from the service.","answer":"Drug tests are extremely sensitive and consuming certain poppy seed foods can actually lead to positive urine drug tests. Other foods can set off a drug test, but it's nearly impossible to tell which ones will. During most workplace drug tests, a trained physician will list the results as negative unless they see other evidence of opiate use such as needle marks, intoxication, or very high concentrations of opiates in the system. The military on the other hand may take serious disciplinary action if they find any opioids in a drug test, even if the culprit is only poppy seed foods. To answer the question, Yes, poppy seeds can set off a drug test, but it generally does not result in a positive test unless they are being ultra strict."},{"question":"What is the title of the flagship game that was designed to be the flagship title for the series, per the paragraphs which follow?Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy[c][d] is a series of games within the Final Fantasy video game franchise. It was primarily developed by series creator and developer Square Enix, which also acted as publisher for all titles. While featuring various worlds and different characters, each Fabula Nova Crystallis game is ultimately based on and expands upon a common mythos focusing on important crystals tied to deities. The level of connection to the mythos varies between each title, with each development team given the freedom to adapt the mythos to fit the context of a game's story.The series, originally announced in 2006 as Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy XIII, consists of seven games across multiple platforms. Final Fantasy XIII, designed as the series' flagship title, was released in 2009. The creative forces behind the series include many developers from previous Final Fantasy titles, including Shinji Hashimoto and Motomu Toriyama. The mythos was conceived and written by Kazushige Nojima. The first games announced for the series were Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XV (as Versus XIII), and Final Fantasy Type-0 (as Agito XIII). All three games went through delays. After Final Fantasy XIII and Type-0's releases, their respective teams used ideas and concepts from development to create additional games. For later games, other studios have been brought in to help with aspects of development. Final Fantasy XV was distanced from the series brand for marketing purposes, though it retains thematic connections.Seven titles, the original three projects and four sequels or spin-offs, have been released as of 2016. The series is complemented by works in related media, including companion books, novelizations, and manga. Final Fantasy XV notably expanded into a multimedia project, spawning a feature film and an original animated webseries. Individual games have generally received a positive reception, although opinions have been more mixed over various aspects of the three Final Fantasy XIII games. Reception of the mythos' use in the released games has also been mixed: while some critics called it confusing or too similar to the lore of the main series, others were impressed by its scope and use. Retrospective opinions on the series have also been mixed.","answer":"Final Fantasy XIII was designed as the flagship title for the series."},{"question":"What color should I paint my nails?

The girls stare at me, fingers in their mouths. With their motherright behind them, they have more curiosity than fear.“You were bad,” the biggest of the little girls says, pointing at me and giggling.She picks up a handful of grass and throws it at me. Her younger sister does the same, and tufts of dead leaves,sticks, and pebbles fly in my direction. Their mother doesn’t stop them.At the halfway point in the afternoon, one by one we are unchained and taken to the park’s bathroom. When Iwash my hands, I get my first look at my new self in the mirror. My ears and eyes are too big and my head is too small. Idon’t recognize myself. There’s nothing of me that stares back in the reflection. None of it seems real.Two girls my age—not prisoners, real girls—come in and start to fuss with their hair and makeup. They catch mestaring at them, and they also see the guard behind me, gripping my clothes so I can’t run away. They go silent, and whenI am yanked back out to the chain gang, I can hear the laughter burst out of them. It sounds like the laughter that’s burstout of me when I’ve made fun of someone I didn’t care about hurting.I don’t know those girls, I say to myself. None of this will get back to my friends. It’s small comfort.This evening is the same as the last, and the next day is the same as this one.

","answer":"In a futuristic boot camp designed to mold wayward souls into obedient beings, the oppressive atmosphere reeked of strict discipline and technological advancement. Cyborg guards, their cold metal frames accentuated by glowing red eyes, patrolled the compound with unwavering vigilance. They were a menacing presence, a stark reminder of the unforgiving nature of this dystopian facility.Amidst the eerie silence, a mother sternly admonished her two young daughters, drawing their attention to Bella, a girl who stood out as an outcast among them. The girls, their innocent curiosity overcoming any sense of fear, taunted Bella, pelting her with debris as their mother passively observed. The laughter of the children, echoing through the desolate surroundings, mirrored the cruelty that permeated the very essence of the boot camp.As the afternoon sun reached its zenith, the prisoners were momentarily unchained and escorted to the park's bathroom. It was here that Bella caught a glimpse of her altered reflection—the unfamiliar features, with oversized ears and eyes, betrayed any remnants of her former self. The sight was disorienting, a stark reminder of the sacrifices she had made in this futuristic hellscape.In the midst of this unsettling encounter, two girls of similar age, unbound by imprisonment, entered the bathroom. They preened themselves, tending to their hair and applying makeup, their actions a stark contrast to Bella's constrained existence. The guards, ever vigilant, stood behind Bella, a constant reminder of her captivity. The girls fell silent, their gaze meeting Bella's, and an unspoken understanding passed between them. The laughter that erupted from their lips was laced with derision, reminiscent of the cruel laughter Bella had once indulged in, oblivious to the pain inflicted on others.Alone with her thoughts, Bella sought solace in the realization that these strangers held no connection to her past life, offering a glimmer of hope that her torment would remain confined within the confines of this futuristic boot camp. But such small comfort did little to alleviate the relentless repetition of her daily existence. Days blurred together as new recruits replaced those who graduated or were expelled from the program. Sundays brought mandatory chapel sessions, while the other days were consumed by schoolwork and addiction therapy. The latter involved laboring through thick workbooks, where the detrimental effects of drugs were expounded upon, and participants were tasked with introspection and listing the individuals they had harmed.Despite doubting the genuine scrutiny of her notebooks, Bella and her fellow prisoners diligently completed the exercises, aware that any transgressions could amplify their suffering. The weight of her circumstances pressed heavily upon her, yet a steadfast resolve emerged—an internal mantra repeated incessantly: \\"I can endure six months of this.\\" The alternative—a three-year prison sentence—loomed as a daunting specter, compelling Bella to find strength in the belief that she could persevere through the arduous ordeal that lay ahead."},{"question":"Come up with a series of haiku's that doubles as a chicken soup recipe.","answer":"Start to cut veggiesOnion, carrot, celeryMake them the same sizeMelt butter in potSautee all the vegetablesAdd the seasoningsUse salt, pepper, thymeMake sure to add garlic tooSautee until softPour in chicken brothSix cups should work perfectlyAdd in the chicken piecesTurn up the heat toLet it come to a boilSimmer on low heatTwo hours at leastRemove the chicken to shredBut let it cool firstAdd shredded chickenTo the soup and let it meldFinish with parsleyOptional: lemonThis will make a tasty soupCongrats!

Looking straight at the Kansas interstate ahead of me, it's almost as if I gain no ground no matter how fast I go. Maybe part of it is due to the smooth, straight road that stretches off into the horizon, but I could almost convince myself that I'm staying in place, like driving on some gargantuan treadmill. I turn to my left, however, and am quickly reminded of how fast I'm truly going. The trees are almost a blur, and I shudder to think about what would happen if I lost control at this speed. Is this what they call intrusive thoughts? I could so easily, with a single twist of the steering wheel, do something unthinkable and irreversible, especially at this speed. I turn back to the road ahead of me, shaking off the way these thoughts make my scalp tingle. Long road trips tend to do this to me, I realize. At some point past the fourth or fifth hour on the road, it's almost as if the rest of the world fades away, and I'm left with nothing but my own thoughts, no matter how unusual or intrusive they may be. This is what intergalactic travel must be like, I think to myself, if humans ever achieve that technological milestone. Hurtling through outer space at mind-numbing speeds, alone in vehicles of metal and glass, with nothing to fill the gaps between here and there besides the beat of your own heart and the racing of your own mind. In those moments, would intrusive thoughts carry the same weight? Would another me, in another life, or alternate universe, have these same thoughts as he speeds past galaxies? Would there be any aspect of individual agency in such a spaceship, where the entire trajectory of the journey is computer-generated and mapped out down to the last inch, without any room left for the risk of human error? Would I even feel like I'm charting my own path, or at the mercy of some computer that decides the best route for me?

That year, a similar crisis ended with a last-minute agreement.Investors “are thinking, I've seen this movie many times before and I know the end of it,” Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said.Stay ahead of the marketBut should investors really be so sanguine? Maybe not, according to Mike Sommers, who had a front-row seat to the drama in 2011 as chief of staff for then-Speaker John Boehner.This year’s showdown, he said, “is 100% different,” adding: “I just don't know where the deal space is here.”Several key factors that were in place during 2011 are missing this time around. Back then, the talks began much earlier and there was a different political environment and mutual agreement from the get go that deficit reduction was a top priority for both sides.President Obama and Boehner also socialized in their off hours, making dealmaking a little easier.“We had a willing dance partner in President Obama who understood that the political dynamics changed significantly in 2010 and that he needed a deal on this,” said Sommers, who is now the CEO of the American Petroleum Institute.Both the current standoff and 2011 are similar in one respect: They feature a Democratic president on the eve of a re-election bid facing off against a newly ascendant House GOP majority intent on curbing what they see as his excesses.But those 2011 talks began early and after Obama had established the Bowles-Simpson Commission a year earlier with a mission of finding a balanced budget.Those talks also featured a completely different personal dynamic between the leaders. Obama and Boehner saw each other again and again in the months that led up to that deal, from the formal meetings to golf outings.By contrast, President Biden and Speaker McCarthy have only been in the same room a handful of times in 2023 and their interactions have more often been notable for heated remarks and personal acrimony.Staff meetings also only began in recent days as the leaders belatedly try to find their way to a bipartisan deal against a very tight timeline","answer":"The debt ceiling problem in 2023 is not the same as it was in 2011.

I think they're capable of more than what people might think, and I want to use the IDEA law to back up my ideas.","answer":"The goal of education is for every student to learn and grow into a person who is prepared for adult life. This should apply to all children, regardless of disability. In the case of children who are part of the special education program, it can be easy to say that they are not capable of learning and growing to the same degree as children in the general education setting, so it is less important to help them. However, the idea that every single child deserves the best education possible is not as impossibly idealistic as it may sound. IDEA, a law that was passed in 2004, supports the idea that not only are children with disabilities capable of being educated, but they deserve a free and appropriate education that prepares them for further education, employment, and independent living. Because of this, I believe that children in special education should have as much opportunity as possible to participate in the general curriculum, while still having all of their individual needs met. Schools should make sure that every child, whether they are part of the special education program or not, can thrive."},{"question":"Write a limerick about aliens invading the earth from a hair stylist planet.","answer":"There once were aliens from space, Who came to our planet with grace.

Lunar nodes are the points where the Moon's orbital path intersects with Earth's orbital plane around the Sun. These conditions create the potential for the Moon to align precisely with the Sun, resulting in a solar eclipse. Solar eclipses are limited to specific periods known as eclipse seasons, which happen approximately every six months and last for around 34.5 days.

Use a first-person perspective. The office should have bright overhead lights, a computer, a phone, and a bookshelf.","answer":"I'm not sure where I am. This room resembles that of study. I recognize what appear to be books arranged upon wooden shelves, so this room must belong to a noble of high prestige. But beyond that, everything else is inexplicable. There is no fireplace nor are there candles to provide light. Instead, the room is brightly lit by strange glowing tubes affixed upon the ceilings. Could this be some bizarre plant life from some faraway land? Yet that still does not explain everything else in this room. The study desk appears to be wooden, yet it feels nothing like the wood I've worked with in my lifetime. And upon this desk are two strange objects. One of them is a small black box with strange symbols on top of several rows of buttons, connected by a string to an odd handle-shaped object with two spherical objects at each end. When I lifted this handle, a sudden sound came out from the spherical objects, startling me into dropping it. Perhaps this is a trap or alarm system of some sort? The symbols must guard some sort of great secret or an object of great value. Much warier now, I dared not touch the larger set of buttons next to the small black square. It seems to be connected to a rectangular metal tower on the floor, which is emitting a small hum. This rectangular object is then connected to a glowing square on the desk next to the small black box. I begin to suspect it may be sustained by sorcery. I must escape from this strange place before the noble wizard returns and finds me trespassing. Too many inscrutable secrets lie here, far beyond my comprehension."},{"question":"Write a  sweet short story about a little girl that lives down the lane.","answer":"Once upon a time, a shy little girl named Nelly lived down the lane with her parents.

","answer":"Managing up to senior leaders and executive is a skill that most mid-level employees take years to master. It can be difficult to manage the personalities and unspoken factors that influence these interactions. Here are a few tips that can be of assistance: ∙ Be clear and concise: structure your communication logically. For example, you could start by stating the issue or goal you want to discuss, then explain why it's important, and finally present your solution or recommendation. It's also important to avoid using jargon or acronyms that might make sense to you but are unfamiliar to a leader who isn't as \\"in the weeds\\" of the work. ∙ Be prepared with the information you need to communicate: Think through what information your listener might need to understand your point of view, and then make sure you have that information ready. This can help you avoid being put on the spot or having to wing it. ∙ Know your audience: Try to do some advanced research on who you'll be talking with and get an understanding of their perspective on the topic. What are their priorities? What are they looking to hear or discuss? With senior leaders, it's often helpful to understand their management style and how they like to receive information. Some leaders might like data and stats, while others want a more descriptive presentation. ∙ Be proactive rather than reactive: Try to take the initiative to communicate, rather than waiting for a problem to arise or a question to be asked. Being proactive can also mean anticipating potential issues and addressing them before they become a problem. Try to get ahead of the game.These tips can make an immediate impact towards being a more effective communicator. One more thing to keep in mind though: always seek feedback. Just because you considered the checklist above doesn't mean there isn't room for you to improve. Asking for feedback from your senior leaders can help you understand what's working well and where you can make adjustments.

It allows the simple repeated opening of a given folder. Consider a usecase where three hotkeys are used to open three folders. Instead of adding the line to each of the hotkeys, the function can be called each time with a different argument. Put more simply, it creates a faster way to repeat a task, in this case opening a given folder, without sacrificing line space. While this example isn't space efficient, when a function is two or more lines long, or where the code is onerous to retype, functions are a good choice for efficiency.

One of the top three should be the lesser-known Color of Money. Provide a brief description of each film. Include a title and introduction, leave out the conclusion as I want to write it myself.","answer":"Tom Cruise's Best Moments: The Original Jack of All TradesIntroductionTom Cruise is one of the best-known actors in the world, famous for performing his own death-defying stunts. It’s hard not to be impressed by a close-up shot of Mr. Cruise driving a car at breakneck speeds while weaving in between traffic, or piloting a helicopter. But you may be surprised that our top 3 picks contain more tense moments based on great acting rather than just adrenaline-pumping action.-The Color of Money (1986)Cruise’s first entry on the list is a sequel to a film that he wasn’t in. You may not have heard of The Color of Money, but you will have probably heard of a little film that came out the same year, by the name of Top Gun. 1986 was clearly a good year for Tom Cruise. A film about playing pool may not sound like everyone’s cup of tea, but if you give the film a chance, both Cruise and his co-stars, most notably Paul Newman who was the star of the prequel “The Hustler” manage to draw you into their world. Cruise and the old, wise character of Newman grow closer throughout the film. -Minority Report (2002)A movie about a future where murderers are arrested before they have committed any crime. One of the teams tasked with arresting these future murderers is accused of a future murder himself. This movie felt fresh and even groundbreaking when it was first released back in 2002. The film even featured a reference to future technology, such as the scene where Chief Anderton, played by Cruise, is using his hands to manipulate images and information on a large screen. 18 years later, we can all do this on our phones every day, but the film was shot 5 years before the first iPhone was even released.-Rain Man (1988)Another film where Cruise firmly has his acting hat on—a real tear-jerker with some great comedic moments, too. A selfish young entrepreneur finds out that his father has left a fortune to his Autistic brother. Charlie (Cruise) decides to take his brother (Hoffman) across America on a trip to convince him to give the money over to him.  "},{"question":"My mom had to have her gallbladder taken out.

The docks of Dimsdale were certainly smaller than the one in Grimsby had been, but it seemed to be just as busy. People bustled around as they went about their day and seagulls called loudly as they flew in lazy circles. The fishing boats had already docked and fishmongers yelled about their wares as housewives bustled around in groups and droves, inspecting wares and haggling prices.She stepped off of the plank leading down to the dock and followed the flow of people toward where the luggage was being unloaded. Sophie only had one suitcase that held all her worldly belongings and she had it in her hands. But unsure of what she was supposed to be doing, she waited as passengers called out descriptions of their baggage and the porters hurried to bring them forth.A small crowd had formed near the end of the docks, close to where the fish market had opened.

Five individuals are still unaccounted for, two of those we believe to possibly be still in the building,” Mr Matson said.Mr Matson’s statement comes amid protests by family members outside of the site of the collapse after the city announced plans to begin a demolition process. On Tuesday morning, a crowd gathered in front of the building with signs reading “Corruption Collapses Communities” and chanting “Save Branden, save Ryan!”Experts said the structure, built in the 1900s is extremely unstable. Because of the layout of the building, with the rear brick part holding together much of the steal structure, officials said there were likely no void spaces where trapped victims could have shielded.Authorities said its brittle condition is worsening with time and the possibility of another collapse is now imminent.“We want to get everyone out, we want to do it right now,” Fire Marshal J Morris said as he broke down in tears at Tuesday’s press conference. “So understand, it’s not that we don’t want to do this ... it’s that we have to do it in a safe manner.”","answer":"Q: How many tenants are still unaccounted for from Sunday's Iowa apartment building collapse?

After I was checked in, they have a clerk personally guide me to my room. Along the way, he told me about all the amenities that were offered here. I was amazed by how much this hotel has to offer. Gym rooms, sauna, personal chefs, game lounge, free Uber services for hotel patrons, a movie room, free drinks, and so much more! I cannot remember all of them. The nice hotel clerk led me up to my room and implored me to call if there was anything they could help with. They were all so nice.When I opened the room, it felt like I had a personal party for myself! The pure white beds, the humongous television on the wall, the classic decor. Aah, it was all so amazing! I took a second to also take in the stunning view from the window. It feels like I could see the entire island from this room. They offered 5-star room service 24/7, so can't beat that as well.

I hate this place. Outside my cramped box of an apartment, the temp is a cookin’ at 120F degrees. The low buildings of the sprawling city fade into a gray haze, and the sound of jet airplanes constantly booming overhead overwhelms the drone of traffic on the nearby highways. My box sits adjacent to the canal, alongside which runs the railroad. Either side of the canal is a barren stretch of gravel and dirt that runs its whole length through the city, pock-marked with debris and tents for the homeless. On days like this, looking down the length of the canal, all one sees is a blurred mirage cast from the sun-baked earth. Inside my cramped, messy home, staring at the door, I stand parcel in hand. I need to head out into that oven. Earbuds in, stinking of layers of freshly-applied sunscreen, I go out.For all the issues afflicting my run-down apartment, it at least does a good job of keeping this hellscape outside. The moment I step forward I am filled with second thoughts. The heat presses against me from all angles, and my earbuds only partially stifle the cracking sonic booms.“Delivery?!” Dan shouts.I turn toward Dan. He looks at me, laying on his cot inside his tent, drenched in sweat. A veteran from the Pacific conflict thirty years ago, he lives in his tent beside my apartment. A mixed bag of a man. Some nights when it’s cool I’ll sit outside and chat with him for a bit. When he’s not having one of his episodic fits, he’s decent enough for company. “Yeah, delivery,” I shout back. “That sucks,” he says. Or at least I assume that’s what he said, I couldn’t quite hear it. I nod at him and turn to start my day. Only one job in the queue, 240. This job might feed me for the week, but I’ll need to cross my fingers for some more work soon or I might become Dan’s roommate.

This groundbreaking proposal, if embraced, could pave the way for the next generation of proficient AI models, transcending the Transformer architecture that underpins models such as GPT-4 and Bard, and unleashing novel capacities in content generation.The Constraints of Current ModelsContemporary high-performing generative AI models, like OpenAI's GPT-4, are grounded in the Transformer architecture. Initially introduced by Google researchers in 2017, this architecture forms the backbone of emergent AI models, facilitating an understanding of nuanced inputs and generating extensive sentences and documents.Nonetheless, Meta's AI research team posits that the prevailing Transformer architecture might be reaching its threshold. They highlight two significant flaws inherent in the design:With the increase in the length of inputs and outputs, self-attention scales dramatically. As each word processed or produced by a Transformer language model requires attention to all other words, the computation becomes highly intensive for thousands of words, whereas it's less problematic for smaller word counts.Feedforward networks, which aid language models in comprehending and processing words through a sequence of mathematical operations and transformations, struggle with scalability on a per-position basis. These networks operate on character groups or \\"positions\\" independently, leading to substantial computational expenses.Megabyte Model: The Game ChangerThe Megabyte model, introduced by Meta AI, showcases a uniquely different architecture, dividing a sequence of inputs and outputs into \\"patches\\" rather than individual tokens. Within each patch, a local AI model generates results, while a global model manages and harmonizes the final output across all patches.This methodology addresses the scalability challenges prevalent in today's AI models. The Megabyte model's patch system permits a single feedforward network to operate on a patch encompassing multiple tokens. Researchers found that this patch approach effectively counters the issue of self-attention scaling.The patch model enables Megabyte to perform calculations in parallel, a stark contrast to traditional Transformers performing computations serially. Even when a base model has more parameters, this results in significant efficiencies. Experiments indicated that Megabyte, utilizing a 1.5B parameter model, could generate sequences 40% quicker than a Transformer model operating on 350M parameters.Using several tests to determine the limits of this approach, researchers discovered that the Megabyte model's maximum capacity exceeded 1.2M tokens. For comparison, OpenAI's GPT-4 has a limit of 32,000 tokens, while Anthropic's Claude has a limit of 100,000 tokens.Shaping the AI FutureAs the AI arms race progresses, AI model enhancements largely stem from training on an ever-growing number of parameters, which are the values learned during an AI model's training phase. While GPT-3.5 was trained on 175B parameters, there's speculation that the more capable GPT-4 was trained on 1 trillion parameters.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently suggested a shift in strategy, confirming that the company is thinking beyond training colossal models and is zeroing in on other optimizations. He equated the future of AI models to iPhone chips, where the majority of consumers are oblivious to the raw technical specifications. Altman envisioned a similar future for AI, emphasizing the continual increase in capability.Meta’s researchers believe their innovative architecture arrives at an opportune time, but also acknowledge there are other pathways to optimization. Promising research areas such as more efficient encoder models adopting patching techniques, decode models breaking down sequences into smaller blocks, and preprocessing sequences into compressed tokens are on the horizon, and could extend the capabilities of the existing Transformer architecture for a new generation of modelsNonetheless, Meta’s recent research has AI experts excited. Andrej Karpathy, the former Sr. Director of AI at Tesla and now a lead AI engineer at OpenAI, chimed in as well on the paper. This is “promising,” he wrote on Twitter. “Everyone should hope that we can throw away tokenization in LLMs. Doing so naively creates (byte-level) sequences that are too long.”","answer":"The aliens are here!They're not coming in spaceships.

The model was called Megabyte, and it was capable of generating text, images, and audio that was indistinguishable from human-created content.I was impressed.

But then, I started to read more about Megabyte, and I started to get a bad feeling.The article said that Megabyte had been trained on a massive dataset of text and code. The dataset included everything from books and articles to code from open-source projects.That's when it hit me. The aliens are using Megabyte to learn about us. They're using it to learn our language, our culture, and our technology.And once they know everything about us, they'll be able to take over. They'll be able to control our minds, and they'll be able to enslave us.We need to stop them.

"},{"question":"Food is essential to us. However, sometimes we can overdo it with foods like chocolate. I love chocolate and will eat it as much as possible. I want to kick this habit without getting rid of chocolate completely. How can I cut back my chocolate intake without getting rid of it completely? Can you please list three ways I can cut back on chocolate?","answer":"No problem! Here are three ways you can cut back on chocolate:1) Find a healthier alternative. If you enjoy dessert, try a healthier alternative like fruit. Fruit is a wonderful, sweet dessert. If you want to incorporate chocolate, you can try chocolate-covered strawberries.2) Set a weekly goal. If you're eating a lot of chocolate, try setting a weekly goal for yourself. Instead of five chocolate bars a week, try one bar a week. Limit yourself more and more until the habit is kicked out without getting rid of chocolate as a whole.3) Have a friend hide your excess chocolate. If you're slipping back into old habits, try contacting a friend to help you break them. Have the friend hide the extra chocolate and not give it back unless it's in small quantities. Sometimes forcing the habit to stop is the best way of combating it. At the same time, you'll still have small amounts of chocolate in the house, so you won't be getting rid of it altogether."},{"question":"Come up with a short story about a man who spots a butterfly in a forest, and decides to take it home with him to fantastical results. Give it a heartwarming ending.","answer":"One morning, Tex decided to take a walk in the nearby woods to clear his head. He was having a difficult time trying to take his mind off the fact that just the day before he had missed his opportunity to go on a trip with his friends to Las Vegas, and now he was stuck at home, alone.\\"Well,\\" he thought, \\"at least I can save some money for Christmas.\\" Tex wandered into the dense forest, a place he has been to many times before, and took a seat on his favorite tree stump. He took a deep breath of fresh air into his lungs and exhaled the stress out of his body. As he did this, he spotted the flapping of tiny wings in his periphery; a beautiful, orange monarch butterfly had landed on a stump right in front of him, resting its wings upon landing. The sun beamed down onto the orange and black of its form, and its antennae prominently jutted out from its head.Tex became mesmerized by the sight of the butterfly and decided to approach it to get a better look. The butterfly, unfazed by the approaching human, flapped its wings gently to show off its vibrant, colorful design. Tex became so enamored by the butterfly that he grabbed it and put it in his cupped hands to take back with him to his house. When he got back, Tex opened his hands and discovered that they were empty; the butterfly had vanished!As he looked around his immediate area hoping to find the butterfly, Tex found a beautiful woman standing behind him. The woman was dressed in a white gown, but had the wings of a butterfly; the wings were glistening in the sun as if they were sprinkled with silver glitter. Her hair was as white as wool, and her face bore a subtle smile that comforted him and eased his surprise at her presence.\\"I will grant you three wishes,\\" the woman spoke gently, \\"and then after that, I must leave. Choose wisely, friend.\\"Tex, taking a moment to think, put his head down and contemplated the gravity of this situation before finally looking up at the woman and making his decision. \\"I want to hang out with you for the day!\\" The woman nodded in the affirmative, and then replied, \\"We can do that, I guess!\\""},{"question":"Here are three quotes.

"},{"question":"Write an article explaining the causes of pollution, its consequences and how we can take steps to overcome it.","answer":"Since the industrial revolution, in the eighteenth century, people all over the world have been burning fossil fuels in large quantities, in power stations and factories. This has filled the air with pollutants. Some of these pollutants react with other gases in the air. Do they form dangerous chemicals?Firstly, fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) are formed from decaying matter, compressed underground thousands of years ago. A piece of coal is, therefore, not a harmless black stone, but it contains sulphur. As sulphur burns it changes to a gas called sulphur dioxide. When this fuel is burnt in the power station, gas escapes through the chimneys into the atmosphere and harms the quality of the air. It dissolves and falls as acid rain, which harms plants, kills small mammals and wears away concrete paths and statues.As a result of driving in a vehicle powered by petrol or diesel, we are not only gaining a carbon footprint but contributing to the pollution in the environment. When petrol and air enter a car engine, a chemical reaction takes place. Exhaust fumes are produced and these emissions contain harmful chemicals, including two called nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. If there are high levels of chemicals in the air we breathe, there will be an increase in chronic health issues, like asthma or chest infections.Therefore, we must take urgent steps to stop these pollutants from contaminating our world. One possible solution is that power stations use a process called lime (calcium oxide and water) to remove sulphur dioxide from the waste gases before they escape from the power station chimneys. Alternatively, people could consider purchasing an electric, hybrid or biodiesel car, which will be cleaner for the environment. It may be essential to use renewable resources, harnessing the power of the sun and the wind... wind farms, solar power, hydropower and geothermal energy to run our industry, power our appliances and heat our homes efficiently."},{"question":"Write a short story about 3 teens from a small town who discover a Haunted House, including dialogue and write the story in an ominous tone.","answer":"It was a misty fall evening in the small town of Creepton and three teenage friends cycled through the deserted streets. Steve, the eldest and wisest of the friends, always rode at the front of the pack with Sally close behind. Sally was scared of most things, however being left alone was her biggest fear. Last in the pack was Jack. Jack had a vivid imagination and a strong sense of adventure which often got him into trouble. As the friends meandered through the hazy streets, the air grew even colder and something just felt off. \\"I think I might go home guys, but I need you to take me\\", whimpered Sally. Steve of course obliged but Jack had other ideas, \\"OK fine, but let's go a different route, it'll be more fun!\\" he said. Steve looked at Sally and sighed, \\"Well, one way or another, we'll get you home safely\\". The three young friends set off down a road they were unfamiliar with, the street sign was barely legible through all the cobwebs and moss. Jack paused to read the sign when he realized, it wasn't a street sign at all, it was a warning that read, \\"Do Not Enter\\". Jack decided not to share this information with the group, they were on an adventure after all. The group cautiously cycled down the unkempt road, it seemed as though nobody had been there in years. As the heavy mist cleared, a sense of foreboding filled the air and a sight lay ahead of them that gave even Jack goosebumps.  It was a house, looming tall in the night sky, with glowing windows that appeared to be alive as though they were the eyes of a monster. The three friends fearfully looked at each other, they knew the house was haunted."},{"question":"What happens when we die?","answer":"In death, the ephemeral flame of our existence meets the vast ocean of eternity, transcending the boundaries of mortal comprehension.

Fancy is the titular character of a series of short stories called Fancy the Forest Cat. I will provide you with some details I have about Fancy already, and then I will ask you what further details I would like to come up with for her based on what I have already come up with.The details I have so far are that Fancy is an adventurous black cat who lives with her owners in a house in the countryside. Her best friend is a Schnauzer named Buddy. Fancy and Buddy have owners who love them very much and they likewise love spending time with their owners. When their owners go to work, Fancy likes to go outside and spend time in the forest. Hence she is called Fancy the Forest Cat. She and Buddy can get into mischief together, and sometimes with other animal characters. Then she returns to the house at the end of each day when her owners come back home. She lives a very fun and nice life.  The Fancy the Forest Cat short stories are about Fancy's adventures in the woods. In the world of Fancy the Forest Cat the animal characters have certain anthropomorphic qualities. They can't walk upright or wear clothes or drive cars like humans do, but they can talk out loud to one another (as in the animals understand one another, but the humans don't understand the animals). When communicating with one another, the animal can speak and express their thoughts to one another as humans do. The stories are family-friendly and suitable for children. They can have adventure and excitement but ultimately are meant to be fun and uplifting. Those are all the details have so far. The details/ideas that I would like inspiration from you are three primary things 1. What are two additional qualities that I can add for Fancy, like what are additional things she likes to do, one of which can help establish a theme for the stories overall? 2. What is one idea for something she doesn't like that can cause conflict or trouble in the story when she encounters this thing? 3. Can you make a pitch for a Fancy the Forest Cat short story? A four to five sentence summary would work best here. The purpose of the first two questions is to flesh out Fancy's character a bit more, and the purpose of the third question is to create a story idea for her character based on your answers to the first two questions (your ideas to the first two questions should impact the story idea for question three).Please compose your response in a numbered format to the three questions I have above, and also make sure your ideas will be compatible with the ideas I have for Fancy already. Remember, the stories can be exciting but should have a happy conclusion.","answer":"1. Fancy would love to spend time on a sunny day on the lawn of her house and spread out and relax under the sun. Then when she goes into the forest, what she loves to do most is explore and go searching for things due to her curious and adventurous nature. This theme of exploration can add an adventure element to the stories. 2. Like most cats, Fancy is also scared of a hawk that is known for living in the area. When this hawk appears while Fancy is outside, she has to go hide. This can create conflict and excitement in the story since Fancy has to evade the hawk from catching her when it appears. Of course, since it's a family-friendly story suitable for children, Fancy is always able to escape the hawk and she never gets caught. 3. At the start of the story, Fancy is outside enjoying the sun while her owners are home. When her owners go to work, Fancy goes exploring an area of the forest she hasn't visited yet out of curiosity, against Buddy's warnings since the area is unexplored by them. While she's out exploring this new area of the forest, a hawk appears and Fancy has to run and hide from the hawk. Fortunately, Buddy shows up and barks at the hawk to scare it away and rescue Fancy. Buddy and Fancy return to the house when their owners come home and they all continue living happily ever after."},{"question":"Can you write a story about unboxing an arcade stick? Please describe every step in detail from purchase to playing with it for the first time.","answer":"I finally got one. The arcade stick that I've been wanting for a while. The Victrix Pro FS is one of the cleanest arcade sticks on the market, and I had to have one. I saved up a lot of money for this day and was really happy that the shop still had one in stock. \\"Hope you enjoy!\\" The cashier handed it over to me. I clutched the box like I was hugging a newborn baby. The corners started digging into my face because I was hugging it so hard. The cashier thought it was a little weird, but I didn't really care. Time to head home.I arrived home and cleared the table of all debris. I placed the Victrix Pro FS box on the table and went to look for a pair of scissors. Then, after grabbing the pair of scissors, I start to unbox the arcade stick. The first step was getting the arcade stick out of the box. I slowly cut through the circular stickers that were sealing the box. Each snip of the scissors sounded heavenly as I was one step closer to opening the box. Once the stickers were cut, I put the pair of scissors down for a job well done. I slowly open the box, being careful not to tear it. Each flap is another step toward my grand goal. Once the box is open, I see a purple bag being kept in place by two cardboard holders, one on each side. I gradually slide the bag out of the box, again taking care to not rip the box along the way. Once the arcade stick is out, I put the box to the side and take the cardboard off the side and put it into the box. The only thing left was the purple bag. It was made of a tough, polyester material. It couldn't stand in my way. I undress the arcade stick and see the most beautiful thing. The silver finish on the body. The shiny, black buttons create the most hypnotic sound.\\"Click, Click\\"It was perfect."},{"question":"Can you write a paragraph promoting the return of a farmer's market in downtown Springsboro?

As a concerned neighbor, I have noticed the number of sunburns that many individuals in our community have gotten due to the intense sunlight in the pool area.Why hasn’t the HOA Board taken any measures to address this issue? I have witnessed several individuals complain about the lack of shade while commenting on how it makes their pool experience unbearable. A retractable roof will not only increase the happiness and overall health of our residents but will also raise the property values of homes in our community. The pool is an important part of our community, and a retractable roof is not a common amenity found in other communities. As such, potential homebuyers would be encouraged to live here based on this luxury. I strongly urge the Board to take immediate action and install a retractable roof over the pool area. It will provide much-needed shade while increasing the value of our community in numerous ways.
